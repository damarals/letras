Youthful Praise

Well I know that I may have had my share of failing and falling
But I have come to understand one thing remains
By all he's done I have been made holy worthy of serving,
The one, the one who brought eternity so deep in my heart
Open your eyes and see
The wonder of a life so wonderfully free
Lift up your head, believe
There is more, there's so much more
Lift up your head, believe
There is more, there's so much more to see
You me remind still of a hope and promise daring my heart
To be brave and honest while you strengthen me so deep in my heart
Is mercies are new every morning... his mercies are new every day
His mercies are new every morning
Beautifully new every day"
