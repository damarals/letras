"1" "Father Of Lights
Jesus Culture

Like a flame, love burned in your eyes
Driving you to pay the greatest price
You bought my life so I could be alive
Reflecting you, reflecting love

Everything good comes from you, father of lights
Your love will always pierce through the darkest night

Love has a voice, love has a name, Jesus, Jesus
Your love is a light, filling my eyes, Jesus, Jesus

You bore the weight of death upon your heart
Your last breath tore the veil apart
You made a way for me to walk in grace
So I could love you, face to face

I will never be the same
Love has called my name
From the ashes, I rise to proclaim
Your love is undefeated, forever you will reign
Justice has won again"
