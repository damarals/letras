"1" "What Can I Bring
Vineyard

This is my song to you
A melody of thanks for you
An expression of wonder
At your beauty and your splendor
No other cry have I
Than to know you more and lift you high
Oh God of infinite glory
Above all you are worthy

What can I bring to you
Simply a song of love and boundless gratitude
My whole life for you
You've rescued me from death
Given me your kingdom and blessed me with your love
Countless mercies from above

Had I riches, I would bring them
Had I kingdom, I would lose them
Had I the world, too small a gift
Would it be, for you"
