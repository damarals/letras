Gaither Vocal Band

Chorus
Low down the chariot let me ride
Low down the chariot let me ride
Low down the chariot let me ride
Low down the chariot let me ride
Low down the chariot let me ride
Low down the chariot let me ride
Low down the chariot let me ride
Low down the chariot let me ride
Ride on (ride on King Jesus)
Ride on (ride on King Jesus)
The conquering King
I wanna go to heaven in the morning

I've been trying so hard just to make it on through
You know I tried to live the way You want me to
I wanna say goodbye to all sin inside
I don't wanna miss that great glory ride
So when You break on through that golden sky
Please slow it down, donâ€™t pass me by
Swing that chariot way down low
I wanna go like Elijah when I'll go.

Oh, low down the chariot (Let me ride)
Oh, low down the chariot (Let me ride)
Low down the chariot (Let me ride)
Low down the chariot (Let me ride)
Oh, low down the chariot (Let me ride)
Oh, low down the chariot (Let me ride)
Low down the chariot (Let me ride)"
