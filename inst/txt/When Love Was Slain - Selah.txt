"1" "When Love Was Slain
Selah

Verse One:
This world is not my home,
Oh, this world is not my home,
My home's been made at Heaven's throne,
This world is not my home.
This life is not my own,
Oh, this life is not my own,
I am His and His alone,
This life is not my own.

Chorus:
I was bought when Love was slain,
What I cost, to pay death's wage,
Now ransomed, I am freedom's slave,
My Jesus raised me from the grave.

Verse Two:
Come now and walk with me,
Oh, come now and walk with me,
Together we and Lord shall meet,
Come now and walk with me.

Chorus:
I was bought when Love was slain,
What I cost, to pay death's wage,
Now ransomed, I am freedom's slave,
My Jesus raised me from the grave.
(Repeat)

Verse Three:
Soon Lord, very soon,
Oh, soon Lord, oh very soon,
You'll come take me to be with You,
Soon Lord, very soon.
Soon Lord, oh very soon."
