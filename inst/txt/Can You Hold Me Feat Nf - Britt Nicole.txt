"1" "Can You Hold Me (Feat. Nf)
Britt Nicole

It feels like a tear in my heart
Like a part of me missing
And I just can't feel it
I've tried and I've tried
And I've tried

Tears on my face I can't take it
If lonely's a taste that's all that I'm tasting
Do you hear my cry?
I cry, oh
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me in your arms?

Cuz when I'm in your arms, in your arms
I don't wanna be nowhere else
Take me from the dark, from the dark
I ain't gonna make it myself
Put your arms around, put your arms around me
Let your love surround me
I am lost, I am lost

If I ain't got you, yeah
If I ain't got you I ain't got nothing at all
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me in your arms?

Yeah, yeah
I feel like it's just me
Like it's just me
Where it gon' take, where it gon' be
I don't even know
But I'm lonely, feel like I don't even know me
I don't even know me (I feel it too)
Gotta have you, gotta see you
You're the only thing I ever think about
The only one that I can't live without
(yeah, gotta see you)
I need you, need you to hold me now

Can you hold me?
(if I ain? t got you, if I ain? t got you!)
(I ain't got nothing, I ain't got nothing!)
(if I ain't got you!)
Can you hold me?
(if I ain? t got you, if I ain? t got you I'm lonely!)
(if I ain't with you I'm lonely, I'm lonely!)
Can you hold me in your arms?
(I need you, I need you!)

Can you hold me?
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me in your arms?

I feel like it's just me
Like it's just me
Where it gon' take, where it gon' be
I don't even know, I don't even know
But I'm lonely, lonely
Feel like I don't even know me
Feels like I don't even know me
I don't even know me

Can you hold me?
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me in your arms?"
