Blessed are the pour in spirit
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven
Blessed are those who mourn
For they will be comforted
Blessed are the meek
For they will inherit the earth
Blessed are those who hunger
And thirst for righteousness
For

They will be filled
They will be filled
They will be filled
They will be filled

Blessed are the merciful
For they will be shown mercy
Blessed are the pure in heart
For they will see God
Blessed are the peacemakers
For they will be called the sons of God
Blessed are those who are persecuted
Because of righteousness
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven"
