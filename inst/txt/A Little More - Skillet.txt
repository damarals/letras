Love is all around you now, so take a hold
Hidden in our words, it sometimes ain't enough
Don't suffocate itday after day, it's buildin' up
'Cause when you're feeling weak
you know I'm strong enough

Just one more day
One more day

Oh, let the world crash, love can take it
Oh, let the world come crashin' down
Oh, let the world crash, love can take it
Love can take a little
Love can give a little more

Love is indestructible, so take a hold
Sometimes hard to find a reason good enough
I'll stand beside you, never leave through it all
And faith will bring a way to the impossible

Just one more day
One more day

Oh, let the world crash, love can take it
Oh, let the world come crashin' down
Oh, let the world crash, love can take it
Love can take a little
Love can give a little more

You can find me
You can find me
You can find me anywhere
Take a look over you shoulder
I'll be standing there

Love is all around you now, so take a hold
And faith will bring a way to the impossible

You can find me, you can find me
(Just one more day, one more day)
You can find me anywhere
You can find me, you can find me
(Just one more day, one more day)
You can find me anywhere

Let the world crash, love can take it
Oh, let the world come crashin' down
Oh, let the world crash, love can take it
Love can take a little
Love can take a little
Love can take a little
Love can give a little more

A little more
Take a little more
Take a little more"
