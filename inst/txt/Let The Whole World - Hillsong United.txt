Hillsong United

Let the whole world sing your praise
Let criation bow down before You
You've got my whole world in Your hands
Let my heart sing a song of freedom.

My heart's abandoned tou your name,
Light of the whole world livin' in me.
Let the nations resound for you, Lord
To see salvation here on the earth, here on the earth.

You are the god of all my dreams
I'll follow you and everything
I have is your, it's yours
I'm living life for you and my world will never be the same.

I'm living for you, God
So all will see your kingdom come
And nothing in this world is gonna stop now
It won't hold me down."
