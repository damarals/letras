Jesus Culture

And hope, fills my soul
The love that you've shown
Brings refreshing like the rain
And peace, floods my heart
I know nothing apart
Apart from your glories god

You are glorious
And you are holy, holy
The heavens shout
That you are worthy, worthy

Oohhhh

Your love, frees my soul and fear has no hope
For you have broken the chains
And now joy, fills my life
Your spirit your light
I'm undone by the kindness of christ

You are glorious
And you are holy, holy
The heavens shout
That you are worthy, worthy
And my soul cries out
That you are holy, holy
And nations shout
That you are worthy worthy

And let the sound of our praise
And heavens will shake
And the earth will move"
