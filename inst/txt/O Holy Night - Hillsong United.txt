Hillsong United

O Holy Night!
The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night
Of the dear Saviour's birth.

Long lay the world
In sin and error pining.
Till He appeared
And the Soul felt its worth.

A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn.

Fall on your knees!
Oh, hear the angel voices!
/O night divine,
The night when Christ was born;/

Truly He taught
Us to love one another,
His law is love
And His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break,
For the slave is our brother.
And in his name
All oppression shall cease.

Sweet hymns of joy
In grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts
We praise His holy name.

Christ is the Lord!
And we shall ever praise Him
His power and glory
Ever more proclaim!

/O night divine,
The night when Christ was born;/

Fall on your knees!
Oh, hear the angel voices!
/O night divine,
The night when Christ was born;/"
