"1" "Its All About The Rhyme
P.O.D.

I grew up in the ghetto
With my home boys
We be chillin
Chillin with the dope
Living life with no hope
Life was about the rhyme
Busting out raps
Just to pass the time
But now we're older
A litte bit taller
Maybe I should call her
Light up a smokie
Play some hokey Pokey
Pour me a glass of Cokey
Life was all about the rhyme
Now I got no time
