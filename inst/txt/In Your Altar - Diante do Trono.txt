"1" "In Your Altar
Diante do Trono

I cannot live for myself anymore
Help me, o Lord
Show me your ways,
teach me your thoughts
Your will is better than mine
I surrender my dreams
On your altar, my desires
I surrender

A place of dying
A place where I lay down my life
As a living sacrifice
A place of renouncing
A place where I yield my heart
Lord, it's for you that I live and I die
I living sacrifice"
