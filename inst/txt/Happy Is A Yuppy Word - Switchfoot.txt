"1" "Happy Is A Yuppy Word
Switchfoot

everyone dies
everyone loves a fight
nothing is sound
nothing is right side right
evening comes when the sun goes down in red
nothing is cool
when will all the fighting end
when will all the fighting end

happy is a yuppy word
nothing in the world could fail me now
it's empty as an argument
I'm running down a life that won't cash out
cash out

everything fails
everything runs it's course
a time and a place
for all of this loving war
everyone buys
everyone's gotta price
and nothing is new
when will all the failures rise
when will all the failures rise rise

happy is a yuppy word
nothing in the world could fail me now
it's empty as an argument
I'm running down a life that won't cash out
cash out

happy is a yuppy word
blessed is the man who's lost it all
happy is a yuppy word, word

I'm looking for an orphanage
I'm looking for a bridge I can't burn down
I don't believe the emptiness
I'm looking for the kingdom coming down
everything is meaningless
I want more than simple cash can buy
happy is a yuppy word
happy is a yuppy word
happy is a yuppy word
happy is a yuppy word

nothing is sound
nothing is sound
nothing is sound
nothing is sound
nothing is sound
nothing is sound
nothing is sound

happy is a yuppy word
nothing in the world could fail me now
happy is a yuppy word word

so calm down yeah
so calm down yeah
so calm down yeah"
