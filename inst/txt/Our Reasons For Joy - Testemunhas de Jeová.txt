"1" "Our Reasons For Joy
Testemunhas de Jeová

Our reasons for joy are abundant
Like riches increasing in worth
Desirable things of all nations
Are joining us in all the earth
The joy in our heart is well-founded
With roots reaching deep in God's word
We daily partake of its teachings
Faith follows the things we have heard

Our causes for joy are deep-seated
Like embers that burn in our hearts
Though troubles and trials beset us
Endurance jehovah imparts
Jehovah our God is our joy
The work of his hands our delight
How deep are his thoughts, how great are his works
Abounding in goodness and might!

We gladly behold his productions
The heavens, the sea, and the land
We gaze at the book of creation
Applauding the work of his hand
Triumphantly we now bear witness
Proclaiming the kingdom of God

The news of its birth and its blessings
We joyously spread all abroad
Eternal rejoicing approaches
Like daylight that follows the night
The promised new earth and new heavens
Will bring everlasting delight
Jehovah our God is our joy
The work of his hands our delight
How deep are his thoughts, how great are his works
Abounding in goodness and might!"
