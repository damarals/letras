All I see is
Shattered pieces
I can't keep it hidden like a secret
I can't look away!
From all this pain in a world we made!

Everyday you need
A bulletproof vest
To save yourself from what you could never guess!
Am I safe today?
When I step outside in the wars we wage!

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown!

[Chorus]
Sound it off, this is the call!
Rise and revolution!
It's our time to change it all
Rise and revolution!
Unite and fight, to make a better life!
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call, tonight, we rise!

Rise
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise!

Like a hand grenade
Thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos
Trying to escape the flame
Yesterday is gone!
Faster than the blast of a car bomb!

And when the scars heal
The pain passes
As hope burns, we rise from the ashes!
Darkness fades away!
And a light shines on a brave new day!

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown!

[Chorus]
Sound it off, this is the call!
Rise and revolution!
It's our time to change it all
Rise and revolution!
Unite and fight, to make a better life!
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call, tonight, we rise!

Rise
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise!

In a world gone mad
In a place so sad!
Sometimes it's crazy
To fight for what you believe!
But you can't give up
If you wanna keep what you love!
(Keep what you love)
(Keep what you love)
(Keep what you love)
(Keep what you love)
Never give up, no!

Rise
Rise and revolution
Rise
Rise and revolution

Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call!

Rise
Like we're alive
Tonight, we rise
Make a better life
Tonight, we rise!

Rise, rise, rise and revolution
Rise, rise, rise and revolution
Rise
