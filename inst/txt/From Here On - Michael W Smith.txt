Michael W. Smith

You must have felt alone
Reaching through your doubt
But I never meant to close you out
While I was building dreams
You were building fears
And I was the cause of all those tears
But can I start over and break new ground?
I know Iâ€™ve let you down (oh babe...)

Do you feel the weight of the world
Heavy on your shoulders
Well, let my love take you down another road
And lighten up the load
From here on

Many were the times I failed to follow through
Of pieces of heaven I promised you
It wasnâ€™t paradise, it wasnâ€™t even close
And i hurt the one I love the most
And sorry could never be good enough
But I will make it up to you...

I know you feel the weight of the world
Heavy on your shoulders
Let my love take you down another road
And lighten up the load
From here on
