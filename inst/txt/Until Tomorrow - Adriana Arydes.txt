"x"
"1" "Until Tomorrow
Adriana Arydes

Chorus:
Ooh..you're movin too fast
all i need is a time to wait until tomorrow
you, just keep holdin on, holdin on to the pain
we felt together back in time

Verse One:
There is a reason that I need you
To always be my friend
Cause I'm tryin
But you ran away
And left me to pretend

Bridge One:
I keep on movin away from you
When you come close to me
I can't keep playin your games no more

Chorus x2

Verse Two:
When I close my eyes I see
A vision of you and me
The empty promise that you had made
A how you'd wait for me

Bridge Two:
Without your arms around me tight
Is more than enough for me
I told you wiat until we're right
Baby can't you see

Chorus x2
Bridge
