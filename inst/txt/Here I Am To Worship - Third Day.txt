"1" "Here I Am To Worship
Third Day

Light of the world, stept down into darkness
Open my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spend with You

Refrein
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You are my God
You`re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderfull to me

King of all days oh so highly exalted
Glorious in Heaven above
Humbly you came to the earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

Refrein 2x
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You are my God
You`re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderfull to me

I`ll never know, how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross. 3x

Refrein 4x
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You are my God
You`re all together lovely, all together worthy, altogether wonderfull to me."
