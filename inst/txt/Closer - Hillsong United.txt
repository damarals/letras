"1" "Closer
Hillsong United

VERSE
There is no life without You
You have all that we need
Where You are
Every fear is broken
And the darkness must flee

CHORUS
Closer and closer
We want to know You
Reaching out
Reaching out
Here in Your presence
We want to go deeper
In Your light
Come alive

VERSE
There is no one beside You
You alone are enough
You fling the doors of
Your heart wide open
And we are lost in Your love

BRIDGE
To You
We will come running
In You
We find belonging
Your love
Is all that can satisfy"
