Amazing love,
now what else shall I need
Your name brings life,
it's more than the air I breathe

My world has changed,
when Your life You gave for me
My purpose found
and all that You want for me

And I've found myself in You, Lord
And I've found myself in You

And I've found myself in You, Jesus
And I've found myself in You, Lord

Chorus:

So take me to a place
where I can see You face to face
and all I wanna do
all I wanna do, is worship You
So take me to a place
where I can see You face to face
and all I wanna do,
all I wanna do, is worship You"
