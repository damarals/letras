Fireflight

I wanna know you
There's so much at stake
Can't face the melodies
They bend me until I break
Hiding from the past
But its eating me alive
Can't block it out when it's comin' from inside

Every turn leads me to a new dead end
Lost again
I'm screaming your name

Come close come close
And call my name
How can you turn your back on me when you know my pain
Stay close stay close
Light up the night
Save me from the part of me that's begging to die

Precious denial
A stone to break my back
The chains I carry won't cut me any slack
Imprisoned by fear with no room for my heart
My only hope
Only you can heal the scar

Every turn leads me to a new dead end
Lost again
I'm screaming your name

(chorus)

Stay by my side
If you leave me I will die
Stay by my side
If you leave me I will die
Stay by my side
If you hold me, I will fly
If you hold me I will fly
Will you hold me

(chorus)

Come close come close
(come close)
How can you turn your back on me when you know my pain
(when you know my pain)
Stay close stay close
Light up the night
Save me from the part of me that's begging to die"
