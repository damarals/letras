"1" "You Say
Lauren Daigle

I keep fighting voices in my mind
That say I'm not enough
Every single lie that tells me
I will never measure up

Am I more than just the sum
Of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am
Because I need to know

You say I am loved
When I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong
When I think I am weak
And You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong
You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

The only thing that matters now
Is everything You think of me
In You I find my worth
In You I find my identity

You say I am loved
When I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong
When I think I am weak
And You say I am held
When I am falling short
When I don't belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

Taking all I have
And now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure
God, You'll have every victory

You say I am loved
When I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong
When I think I am weak
You say I am held
When I am falling short
When I don't belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

Oh, I believe
Yes, I believe
What You say of me
Oh, I believe"
