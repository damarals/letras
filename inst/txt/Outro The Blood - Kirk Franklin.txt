"x"
"1" "Outro (The Blood)
Kirk Franklin

You have the power to make the seasons change
The rivers flows for you the wind whispers your name
For me you left your throne and traded
Crown for thorns instead
I'm saved within not by your skin
But because your blood was red

We may be different but, the God we serve's the same
Every Sunday we seperate, and bring the father pain
His name is: \"Higher than Any other\"
But you took my place instead
It doesnt matter what color you are no Jesus
\"As long as you're blood was red\"

It reaches to the highest mountain
And it flows to the lowest valley
The blood that gives me strength
From day, to day
it will never lose it's power...
