Youthful Praise

Sing His Praises, Sing His Praises!
Sing His Praises, Sing His Praises!
Sing His Praises, Sing His Praises!
Sing His Praises, Sing His Praises!
Listen Well, I'm on my way, I'm singin' everyday, liftin' up my Savior who died.
Listen and my soul will cry: I'm completely satisfied all because I'm well on my way.
Chorus:
(I'm well on my way) Sing His Praises, Sing His Praises!
(Now that I'm well on my way) Sing His Praises, Sing His Praises!
(Don't you know I'm well on my way) Sing His Praises, Sing His Praises!
(I'm well on my way) Sing His Praises, Sing His Praises!
Ever since I'm on my way I've got better things to say, better 'cause I'm on the right track.
I'm complete, nothing I lack, now there is no turning back, listening to Jesus, the way.
(I'm well on my way) Sing His Praises, Sing His Praises!
(All because I'm well on my way) Sing His Praises, Sing His Praises!
(All because I'm on my way) Sing His Praises, Sing His Praises!
(I'm well on my way) Sing His Praises, Sing His Praises!
Bridge:
Well on my way, well on my way, well on my way!
Well on my way, well on my way, well on my way!
(Now that I'm well on my way)
Well on my way, well on my way, well on my way!
Well on my way, well on my way, well on my way!
Listen Well, I'm on my way, I'm singin' everyday, liftin' up my Savior who died.
Listen and my soul will cry: I'm completely satisfied all because I'm well on my way.
Repeat Chorus
Repeat Bridge
The way!"
