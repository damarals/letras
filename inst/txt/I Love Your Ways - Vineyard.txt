Vineyard

Your beauty, unmatched
You loveliness surrounds me,
Astounding me Your kindness has come
Bringing sweet repentance, forgiveness
Sweet forgiveness

Chorus:
Oh how I love You, Lord my God
Your mercy has quickly won my heart
Your love and Your faithfulness
Surround me everyday
Oh Lord, I love Your ways

Your presence has come
Overwhelming joy is mine, and You are mine
Your glory shines down
I am changed forever, forever
Changed forever"
