"1" "Ready For The Fight
For Today

We've made it too easy
To excuse everything we do as acceptable;
Or that it's just like everyone else.
The popularity of something
Does not excuse it.
We cannot live a life of sliding.
Let us walk straight forward--
Eyes focused on our destination
Body armored for the battle,
Soul ready for the fight.
Prepare us, O God
to go out this time
Honoring your bride
With the respect you deserve.
No more excuses this time.
Keep the dress clean.
We will walk before you
and return with no more dirt upon us.
We will return clean."
