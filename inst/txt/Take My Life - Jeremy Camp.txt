"1" "Take My Life
Jeremy Camp

Here I am before you now
I'm like a child reaching out
Here I am I'm giving all I can
Breaking my pride I feel I'm through
Shattered inside I run to you
And now I give it all to you

Take my life take my mind
take my soul take my will
I am yours now, and I give it all to you

Laying all down before my king
Offering all my everything
Laying all down before the one I serve
I can understand the reasons why
You came on this earth and died
And now I give it all to you

I can feel you on my shoulder
So I know that you are there
I can see you paint my picture
The beauty is all there"
