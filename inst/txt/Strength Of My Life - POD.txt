P.O.D.

Yo! Eternal rhythms in your system so clear.
No negative take your isms stay cleared
We keep it lovely, give you want you want hear (no you
won't hear)
And Matisyahu in the house, stand clear.
P.O.D. in the house, stand clear.
If Jah is for me, tell me whom I gon' fear? (no I
won't fear)

And Jah of Jacob, deserving of my love
And God of Isaac, bring blessings from above
Hashem of Abraham will show me the way
I go down on my knees and this is what I pray.

Strength Of My Life, whom shall I dread?
When them evildoers approach to devour my flesh.
Even if there would be an army against me,
My heart would not fear.

Steer clear from weird vibes.
Chuck a spear these evil guys must realize,
Even if there would rise a war against me.
In this I trust, it's a must.
Elevated is my head, above my enemy.
Surround me with the song of glory
(Yeah, Song of glory, Yeah, ohhh)

Take away the scales from my eyes
Anoint your love upon my life
Have mercy on my soul and hear me when I cry
Do not abandon me, and don't forsake me
Lead me on the path of integrity

Even if there would be an army against me,
My heart would not fear.
Strength Of My Life, whom shall I dread?
When them evildoers approach to devour my flesh.

Back them up against the wall, stumble and fall then
battle y'all
And stand tall, show me favor when I call Oh-oh
Back them against the wall, stumble and them fall
Battle y'all and stand call, show me favor when I call
Oh-oh-oh, yo, Matisyahu, P.O.D.
Eternally, with his majesty
Dwelling in the songs of glory
Dwelling with the song of glory"
