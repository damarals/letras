"1" "Just For You
Catedral

I wanna run
Only to be with you
Cause you are my lord
You are my life, eternity
I wanna sing
Only for you my god
Cause I'm your son
And you are my father of life

I wanna run, I wanna sing
Only to be with you
Yes, I wanna run
Gardens of peace
I know taht you stay here
In my heart
To tell what I have to do
Yes, I wanna run
I wanna sing, just for you"
