Vineyard

My soul glorifies the Lord
Rejoices in God, He is holy (Repeat)

You have lifted up the humble
Filled the hungry with good things
His mercy frees my soul, frees me

You bring joy I've only dreamed of
Set my heart on fire with your love
Your presence takes my breath away

Holy, Holy is His name
Holy is the Lord
He is holy (Repeat)

My Soul glorifies the Lord
Rejoices in You my saviour"
