"1" "How Sweet The Name
Delirious

What would I have become
If you’d never stopped to pull me through
What would this life had done
If you’d never whispered liberty
I heard you sing so sweetly a song of love

Jesus how sweet the name
The name that saves
Jesus how sweet the sound
The sound of grace
The sound of praise
The sound that saves

So many songs I’ve sung
But there’s none more beautiful than you
And here I’ve found myself
So I’m happy to be lost in you
I hear you sing so sweetly, a song called love

Every soul needs a saviour"
