"1" "Time After Time
Vineyard

Over and over and over I see
Your hand of protection resting on me
I'm hiding in the shadow of Your wings

Again and again and again I can hear
The whisper of comfort that drives away fear
I'm waiting in the stillness of Your peace

Time after time I'm reminded of Your love
Time after time I fall down on my knees
Your glory shines it shines down from above
You surround me with Your love time after time"
