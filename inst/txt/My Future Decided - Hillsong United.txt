"1" "My Future Decided
Hillsong United

You hold the future in your hands
You know my dreams and you have a plan
And as you light my way, I'll follow you

My eyes on all of the above
My soul secure in all you've done
My minds made up
And you are the only one for me

Jesus, savior, in my life you are everything
My future decided, I will praise your name
And I know that I am, I am yours
Yeah, I know that I am, I am yours

You hold the earth in your command
You are the rock on which I stand
And as I live each day, I'll follow you

My eyes on all of the above
My soul secure in all you've done
My minds made up
And you are the only one for me

Jesus, savior, in my life you are everything
My future decided, I will praise your name
And I know that I am, I am yours
Yeah, I know that I am, I am yours

We´re not afraid, not chamed ´cause we know
who we are
We are your people and we won´t be silent
Unified hear us cry at the top of our lungs
You our our God and we will not shaken
We´re not afraid, not chamed ´cause we know
who we are
We are the people that broke the silence
Unified hear us cry at the top of our lungs
You our our God and we will not shaken

Jesus, savior, in my life you are everything
My future decided, I will praise your name
And I know that I am, I am yours
Yeah, I know that I am, I am yours

Jesus, savior, in my life you are everything
My future decided, I will praise your name
And I know that I am, I am yours..."
