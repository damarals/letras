"1" "Love Can Do
Amy Grant

Who can say
Why she turned and walked away.
I can't see,
But she's gone away.
Sometimes love
Means we have to stand and fight.
Everybody runs,
Everybody hides,
No, this ain't the movies,
Now it's flesh and blood,
And this thing I'm sure of,

Hey, little girl running out so fast,
Gotta stay put for love to last,
Why you gotta say
That love has gone away;
It's not like that.

Everybody hurts when the feelings fade,
If you want 'em back
You know you gotta stay,
(No running.)
No running.
Love's coming back,
Like only love can do.

Love can do
Things you never thought it could,
Mend a hurt so bad,
Make you feel so good.
Love's for fools
Wise enough to take a chance;
Hear the music girl,
Let me see you dance.
No, this ain't the movies,
Now it's give and take,
And it's your heart at stake.

Hey, little girl running out so fast,
Gotta stay put for love to last,
Why you gotta say
That love has gone away;
It's not like that.

No....

Everybody hurts when the feelings fade,
If you want 'em back
You know you gotta stay,
(No running.)
No running.
Love's coming back,
Like only love can do.

(Get outta my yard.)

Hey, little girl running out so fast,
Yeah, yeah,
Looking for the love you're sure will last.

Why do you have to say it?
Love has gone away;
It's not...like that.
Love's not like that.

Everybody hurts when the feelings fade,
If you want 'em back
You know you gotta stay,
(No running.)
No running.
Love's coming back,
Like only love can do.

Hey, little girl running out so fast,
Gotta stay put for love to last,
Why you gotta say
That love has gone away;
It's not like that.

(No, no, not like that.) No!

Everybody hurts when the feelings fade,
If you want 'em back
You know you gotta stay,
(No running.)
No running.
Love's coming back!

Hey, little girl running out so fast,
Gotta stay put for love to last,
Why you gotta say
That love has gone away;
It's not like that.

No? No!

Everybody hurts when the feelings fade,
If you want 'em back
You know you gotta stay,
(No running.)
No running.
Love's coming back, (Owwww!)
Coming back to stay!

(Oooooooooooooooh-oooooooooh-ooooooooooooooooh!)
