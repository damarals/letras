"1" "Angels We Have Heard On High
Third Day

Angels we have heard on high,
Sweetly singing o'er the plains,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joy astray.

Shepherds why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

Gloria in excelsis Deo. Gloria in excelsis Deo.

Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King

Gloria in excelsis Deo. Gloria in excelsis Deo.

See Him in the manger lay
Jesus, Lord of heaven and earth
Mary Joseph, lend your aid
With us sing our Savior's birth

Gloria in excelsis Deo. Gloria in excelsis Deo."
