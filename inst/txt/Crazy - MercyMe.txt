MercyMe

Why I would I spend my life longing for the day that it would end..
Why would I spend my time pointing to another man..
Isnâ€™t that crazy

How can I find hope in dying, with promises unseen..
How can I learn your way is better
In everything Iâ€™m taught to be..
Isnâ€™t that crazy

I have not been called to the wisdom of this world..
But to a God who's calling out to me..
And even though the world may think
I'm losing touch with reality
It would be crazy
To choose this world over eternity

And if I boast let me boast
Of filthy rags made clean
And if I glory let me glory
In my Savior's suffering
Isnâ€™t that crazy

And as I live this daily life
I trust you for everything
And I will only take a step
When I feel You leading me
Isnâ€™t that crazy

I have not been called to the wisdom of this world..
But to a God who is calling out to me..
And even though the world my think
I'm losing touch with reality
It would be crazy
To choose this world over eternity

Call me crazy
You can call me crazy
Call me crazy

I have not been called to the wisdom of this world..
But to a God who is calling out to me..
And even though the world may think that
I'm losing touch with reality
It would be crazy, It would be crazy, It would be crazy
To choose this world over eternity

Isnâ€™t That crazy..
Call me crazy
You can call me crazy
Call me crazy
