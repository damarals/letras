Fireflight

You've been waiting, hoping you would get a chance
Is this only to give you a second glance?
Cause it won't shine a small light on you
I don't think you need a small light to prove
What's in your heart

Shine where you are
You are my star
Don't waste your time
Chasing neon lights
The light inside of you!
There's a light inside of you

It is useless to be hiding from the truth
I wish you could see yourself the way I do
Let me shine a small light for you
You shine brighter than the moon
Here, in my heart

Shine where you are
You are my star
Don't waste your time
Chasing neon lights
The light inside of you!
There's a light inside of you

Shine where you are
Shine where you are
Shine where you are
You are my star
Don't waste your time
Chasing neon lights
The light inside of you!
There's a light inside of you"
