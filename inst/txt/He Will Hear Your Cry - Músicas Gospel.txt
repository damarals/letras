"1" "He Will Hear Your Cry
MÃºsicas Gospel

God know that we stray,
But forgives us anyway.
If we show we're sincere,
He will us show he cares.

Get down on your knees,
And always say 'please\".
Show God some respect,
When you have a need.

Whenever you're lonely,
Or you are hurting inside.
Call out to the Lord,
And he will hear your cry.

The Lord will be forgiving,
When he hears your pleas.
And he is comforting,
To all those that grieves.

Whenever you're lonely,
Or you are hurting inside.
Call out to the Lord,
And he will hear your cry."
