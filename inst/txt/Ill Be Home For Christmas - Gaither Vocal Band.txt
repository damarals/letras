"1" "I'll Be Home For Christmas
Gaither Vocal Band

I'm dreaming tonight
Of the place I love
Even more than I usually do
And all though I know
It's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the lovelight gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

If only, only in my dreams"
