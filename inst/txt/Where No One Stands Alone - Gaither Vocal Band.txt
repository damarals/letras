"1" "Where No One Stands Alone
Gaither Vocal Band

Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low
In the darkness, as black as could be
And my heart felt alone
And I cried oh Lord
Don't hide your face from me

Hold my hand all the way
Every hour every day
From here to the grave
I know
Take my hand
Let me stand
Where no one stands alone

Like a king I may live in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I dont know a thing
In this whole wide world
Thats worse then being alone

Hold me hand all the way
Every hour, every day
From here to the grave
I know
Take my hand
Let me stand
Where no one stands alone

Take my hand
Let me stand
Where no one stands alone"
