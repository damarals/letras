"1" "America The Beautiful
Gaither Vocal Band

O beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain.
For purple mountain majesties
Above thy fruited plain!

America, America,
God shed His grace on thee.
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.

O beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years.
Thine alabaster cities gleam
Undimmed by human tears.

America, America,
God shed His grace on thee.
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.

And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea."
