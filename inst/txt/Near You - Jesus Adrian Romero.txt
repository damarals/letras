"1" "Near You
Jesus Adrian Romero

If i decided to deny my faith
And never trust in him again
I´d have nowhere to go (bis)
If i disregarded in my heart
The holy grace that saved me
I'd have nowhere to go (bis)
I'm convinced that without your love
My strength would wither away
And without you my thirsty heart
would die
It would simply dry out
Close to you I want to be
I don´t want to fall away from your
presence
