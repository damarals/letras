"1" "Sweep Me Away
Kari Jobe

Father I love your ways
You came in Your mercy and died in my place
All I can do is bow
Because of Your goodness
And your sovereign grace

That You sweep me away
Sweep me away in Your love
Where nothing else matters
Sweep me away
Sweep me away in Your love
Where nothing else matters

Tears rolling down my face
Because of your love
And Your sweet embrace
The peace that just overflows
It's here that I know
You have been waiting to

Sweep me away
Sweep me away in Your love
Where nothing else matters

Sweep me away
Sweep me away in Your love
Where nothing else matters
Nothing else matters

Just you and me!"
