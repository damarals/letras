"1" "Let Your Glory Fall
Vineyard

Father Of Creation
Unfold Your Sovereign Plan
Raise Up A Chosen Generation
That Will March Through The Land
All Of Creation Is Longing
For Your Unveiling Of Power
Would You Release Your Anointing?
O God - Let This Be The Hour

Let Your Glory Fall In The Room
Let It Go Forth From Here To The Nations
Let Your Fragrance Rest In This Place
As We Gather To Seek Your Face

Ruler Of The Nations
The World Has Yet To See
The Full Release Of Your Promise
The Church In Victory
Turn To Us Lord And Touch Us
Make Us Strong In Your Might
Overcome Our Weakness
That We Could Stand Up And Fight

Let Your Kingdom Come (Echo)
Let Your Will Be Done (Echo)
Let Us See On Earth (Echo)
The Glory Of Your Son"
