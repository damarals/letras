"1" "The More I Seek You
Kari Jobe

The more I seek You,
The more I find You
The more I find You,
The more I love You

I wanna sit at Your feet
Drink from the cup in Your hand
Lay back against You and breath
Feel Your heart beat
This love is so deep
It's more than I can stand
I melt in Your peace
It's overwhelming

The more I seek You,
The more I find You
The more I find You,
The more I love You

I wanna sit at Your feet
Drink from the cup in Your hand
Lay back against You and breath
Feel Your heart beat
This love is so deep
It's more than I can stand
I melt in Your peace
It's overwhelming

I wanna sit at Your feet
Drink from the cup in Your hand
Lay back against You and breath
Feel Your heart beat
This love is so deep
It's more than I can stand
I melt in Your peace
It's overwhelming

(Oh, Your love is overwhelming
You know, my Lord, Your love is overwhelming)

I wanna sit at Your feet
Drink from the cup in Your hand
Lay back against You and breath
Feel Your heart beat
This love is so deep
It's more than I can stand
I melt in Your peace"
