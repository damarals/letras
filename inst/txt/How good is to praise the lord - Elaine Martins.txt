"1" "How good is to praise the lord
Elaine Martins

How good is to feel
your holy spirit in my life
you fill me up
with peace, my consoler
how good is to live for jesus

I can foresee uncounted blessings
feel the presence of the king
no matter the pain
you can feel in your heart
He raise you and lovely supports you

oh My God
There's no other like you
change my life
oh my savior
I'll prays his name
in happiness or in pain
How good is to praise the Lord"
