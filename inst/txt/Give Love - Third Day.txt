"x"
"1" "Give Love
Third Day

Whisper softly to me
Share with me your heart
And just ignore the world and what it does
I know that you?ve been hurting, you?ve been torn
apart
And I pull you close and hold you in my arms

If you give love
I?ll return the love and you will see
So much more than you gave away
If you give love
Give it to me

Listen very closely as I sing this song
And please believe that I mean every word
When I say I love you
I mean it with all my heart
Let it be the best thing that you?ve ever heard

Whisper softly to me
Share with me your heart"
