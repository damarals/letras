"1" "The Lost Are Found
Hillsong United

[V.1]
Everlasting
While earthly ages fade
In mercy
Our God Your kingdom reigns

[Chorus]
Lord over everything
You are near
All of the universe
Is at Your feet

[V.2]
In the savior
Injustice brought to right
For your glory
That your name be lifted high


[Chorus]
Lord over everything
You are near
All of the universe
Is at Your feet

[Bridge]
The lost are found
The blind will see
The lame will walk
The dead will live
And You our God
Forever You will reign"
