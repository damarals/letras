"1" "Before You Call
Vineyard

Come to me my people, come
There's no need to be afraid of Your Father
When I see You I will run
I will be there, I will be there

Before You call, I will answer You
While You still speak, I will hear
My ears are turned to the cry
Of my chosen ones
In my love You can rest in me
For You are my very own
So hold on to the hope You have
That I would draw You to myself
For I will never leave You alone

I will not forget You,
I gather my lambs in my arms
So I will comfort You and carry
You close to my heart"
