"1" "God's Not Dead (Like a Lion)
Newsboys

Let love explode and bring the dead to life
A love so bold
To see a revolution somehow
Let love explode and bring the dead to life
A love so bold
To bring a revolution somehow

Now I'm lost in Your freedom
This world I'll overcome

My God is not dead
He's surely alive
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion

God is not dead
He's surely alive
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion

He's roaring like a lion

Let hope arise and make the darkness hide
My faith is dead
I need a ressurrection somehow

Now I'm lost in Your freedom
And this world I'll overcome

My God is not dead
He's surely alive
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion

God is not dead
He's surely alive
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion

He's roaring like a lion

Let Heaven roar and fire fall
Come shake the ground
With the sound of revival

My God is not dead
He's surely alive
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion

God is not dead
He's surely alive
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion

He's roaring like a lion"
