"1" "We're Your Family
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

Touching down in a foreign land
With a thousand miles behind us
Since we left our home
It's Jehovah's hand
That is blessing ev'ry move
And the work that we do isn't easy
But it's all for Jehovah
And the love that we feel for this fam'ly is real
So this we say to you

We're all Jehovah's people
United, we are family
And though your land is far away
We love you
We're your family

Waiting there as our plane came in
You were reaching out to greet us
Then the music starts, and the day begins
And our love grows even more
But we know that it's only Jehovah
Who can cause this to happen
So we'll praise him together and love him forever
On ev'ry distant shore

We're all Jehovah's people
United, we are family
And though your land is far away
We love you
We're your family

Silver wings fly across the sea
To a land so unfamiliar
But we bring good news, and the ones we meet
Are so gentle, kind, and good
And the love we receive from our brothers
Makes us feel we belong here
So wherever we are and no matter how far
We love our brotherhood!

It's good to know
That we have family ev'rywhere we go
From Mali to Mexico
From Japan to Jamaica

We're all Jehovah's people
United, we are family
And though your land is far away
We love you
We're your family
From ev'ry tribe and nation
United, we are family
These bonds of love are plain to see
Because we're Jehovah's family!

Fiji, Tahiti, and New Caledonia
Navajo, Blackfoot, and Cherokee
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Estonia
We love you. We're your family"
