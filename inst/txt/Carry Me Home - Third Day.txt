"1" "Carry Me Home
Third Day

My heart is aching
My bones are tired
And I can't believe
I've fallen down this far

My back is breaking
My mouth is dry
I pray you'll come
And rescue me tonight

Too many days I've gone through the valley
Too many nights I've fallen down
Every time I blindly stumble
You pick me off the ground
And carry me home

My will is crumbling
On every side
I know you haven't
Left me here to die

My life is shaking
And trembling whooa
I'm praying that you'll come
And cover me

Too many days I've gone through the valley
Too many nights I've fallen down
Every time I blindly stumble
you pick me off the ground
And carry me home

My heart is like a stone
But you can break it open...

My will is broken
Your will be done
I'll follow you no matter what may come

Too many days I've gone through the valley
Too many nights I've fallen down
Every time I blindly stumble
You pick me off the ground..."
