"1" "Out Of My Hands
Jeremy Camp

Every day this never ending pressure
Tries to take its claim over my heart
I have tried to hold it all together
But time and time again, I fall apart

But that's where I find my life was never mine at all
You are the one inside always in control

So when it feels like all of this pain is never gonna end
Brought to my knees by all of these things I don't understand
Don't understand, I will let the weight of my fear fall like sand
Out of my hands and into Yours, out of my hands and into Yours

Letting go of worries I can't measure (Measure, measure)
Holding onto truth that's healing me (That's healing me)
Knowing I can trust You is a treasure
With eyes wide open now I finally see

I see that I find my life was never mine at all
You're still the one inside always in control

So when it feels like all of this pain is never gonna end
Brought to my knees by all of these things I don't understand
Don't understand, I will let the weight of my fear fall like sand
Out of my hands and into Yours, out of my hands and into Yours

Take this out of my hands, take this out of my hands (Take this out of my hands)
Take this out of my hands, it's out of my hands
There's nothing that You can't handle
God You are strong enough, only You can take this out of my hands
Out of my hands, You're greater than all of my sorrows
Worthy of all my trust
Thank You Lord this is out of my hands, out of my hands

So when it feels like all of this pain is never gonna end (Never gonna end)
Brought to my knees by all of these things I don't understand
Don't understand, I will let the weight of my fear fall like sand (Fall like sand)
Out of my hands and into Yours, out of my hands and into Yours

Take this out of my hands, take this out of my hands (Take this out of my hands)
Take this out of my hands, it's out of my hands
Take this out of my hands, take this out of my hands
Take this out of my hands, it's out of my hands"
