"1" "The Christmas Songs
Take 6

Chestnust roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yultide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everyboby knows
The turkey and some mistle toe
Help to make the season bright
Little tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa is on his way
Hes loaded lots of toys and goodies on his slaigh
And every mothers child is going to spy
Tosee if rainders really know how to fly

And so, im offering this simple phrase
For kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said, many times many ways
Merry christmas to you"
