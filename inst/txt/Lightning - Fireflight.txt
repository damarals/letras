Fireflight

You put your light in up, with your electric love
You made them feel afraid
Because you're dangerous
They don't understand 'cause you're a mystery
They can't contain your energy

You've been betrayed
You've been knocked down
Hurt by the wind that pushed you out
You were never made to fit the mold
Be a supernova and explode
You were never made to fit the mold
Be a supernova

You put your light in up, with your electric love
You made them feel afraid
Because you're dangerous
They don't understand 'cause you're a mystery
They can't contain your energy
Cause you are a lightning

Now is the time, don''t be afraid
To show the world
You can be great
You were never made to fit the mold
Be a supernova and explode
You were never made to fit the mold
Be a supernova

You put your light in up, with your electric love
You made them feel afraid
Because you're dangerous
They don't understand 'cause you're a mystery
They can't contain your energy
Cause you are a lightning

Make it bright
Make it bright
Bring the light
Bring the light
Break the night
Break the night"
