"1" "The Moment We Come Alive
Red

We're living in a desperate time
Our only hope
Is believing there's another side
To all we've known
The truth hidden before our eyes
A vision of a life beyond our view
If only we could see it through

So reach to the sky
The life we have has come
This night of our lives
We've only just begun
Together we are
Bright as the stars
We're a light that will never die
This is the moment we come alive

We're living in a desperate time
We're waking up
To dreaming of a better life
We won't give up
Our love is like a warning sign
Revealing of a life that's all brand new
If only we can see it through

So reach to the sky
The life we have has come
This night of our lives
We've only just begun
Together we are
Bright as the stars
We're a light that will never die
This is the moment we come alive

This is the moment we come alive
The energy within us
Ignites us forever, forever, forever

So reach to the sky
The life we have has come
This night of our lives
We've only just begun
Together we are
Bright as the stars
We're a light that will never die
This is the moment we come alive"
