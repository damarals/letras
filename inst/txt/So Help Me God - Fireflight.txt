"1" "So Help Me God
Fireflight

You sit beside me
And I love you
But I hate you
I don't want
To feel this way
But I can't stop
You reach for my hand
But I move it
Before you can
I won't let you have the
Power once again

So help me, God
To let this go
To let this go
So help me, God
(Become what I believe)
To break this hold
(I'm afraid to leave)
To find myself
(I just need to breathe)

You think you know me
But you changed me
Into somebody
That I don't ever
Want to be again
I'm letting go now
Of this burden
I've been holding
I've been hurting myself
Now for way too long

It's not too late
It's not too late
To leave it all behind
It's not too late
It's not too late"
