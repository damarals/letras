Hillsong United

(verse 1)
Jesus - God's righteousness revealed
The Son of Man, the Son of God
His Kingdom comes
Jesus - redemption's sacrifice
Now glorified, now justified
His Kingdom comes

(chorus)
And this Kingdom will know no end
And its glory shall know no bounds
For the majesty and power
Of this Kingdom's King has come
And this Kingdom's reign
And this Kingdom's rule
And this Kingdom's power and authority
Jesus - God's righteousness revealed

(verse 2)
Jesus - the expression of God's love
The grace of God, the Word of God
Revealed to us
Jesus - God's holiness displayed
Now glorified, now justified
His Kingdom comes

Jesus...
God's righteousness revealed"
