"1" "Over My Head
Brian Littrell

I tried to figure it out
Time and time again, and time again
I guess there's just some things I'll never understand
'Cause your ways aren't our ways
But deep down in my soul, down in my soul
There is one thing I know that I know

I'm in over my head
I'm right where I wanna be
I'm so lost within your love
The love that always covers me
So high, so deep, so wide
A strong and cleansing tide
My soul has found a place to rest
I'm in over my head

I've been holding on
and now I'm letting go, just letting go
gonna let your love carry me away
I don't know where I'm going
but I'm surrounded by the truth
And I can feel the current pulling me
Deeper and deeper into you

I'm in over my head
I'm right where I wanna be
I'm so lost within your love
The love that always covers me
So high, so deep, so wide
A strong and cleansing tide
My soul has found a place to rest
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head

And I'm in over my head
I'm right where I wanna be
I'm so lost within your love
the love that always covers me
So high, so deep, so wide
a strong and cleansing tide
my soul has found a place to rest
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over

You see me for who I am
You gave me a challenge a head
You made me understand
That your love has always covered me
