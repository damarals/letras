"x"
"1" "Want It All
P.O.D.

My head is in the clouds
I'm just another face, in the crowd
So here I go again, chasing the wind
My heart is split in two, one side at ease
the other is so confused

Why? Why do I want it all?
Why? Why do I want it all?

My eyes are on the price
but my nature hears the lies
I came into this with nothing
Empty handed I'll leave this
Virtue with pleasure is a such inmense increase

Why? Why do I want it all?
Why? Why do I want it all?"
