"1" "Joy
André Valadão

You love me as I am
But never let me live as I am
Follow your steps it is my prayer
Reach out your heart it is my goal

Your love is greater than life
That gives me faith that will never die
I want to dive in your holy world
And be anointed by your Holy Ghost

Your strength gives me hope to look beyond the pain
Your joy gives me faith in everything I say

You are the joy of my life
You give me strength when I sacrifice
You are the joy of my life
Your strength will give me joy to live
Your strength will give me joy to dream"
