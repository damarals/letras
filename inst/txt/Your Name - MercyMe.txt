MercyMe

And I will be thankful if all I have is my breath
And I know that I've been saved by Your grace and in
Your name
In Your name I've found peace
In Your name I've been redeemed

All that I long for is found in your precious name
All that I've ever hoped for is found in your precious

In your name

Jesus You are Faithful when it seems all hope has left
And I know that I've been saved by Your grace and in
Your name

And I want to be an echo of Your sweet voice
Oh Jesus be in all I am"
