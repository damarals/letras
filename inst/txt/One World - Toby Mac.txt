One World
Featuring Siti Monroe

One time
One world
Two times
One love
Three times
Rewind
'Cause I’m a dedicate this song to everyone of God's children

Come as you are
Come just like you be
It's the bumps and curves of our history
But no block in the road that we can't traverse
And no wounds from the past that can't be nursed

All hate gonna to dissipate from our fate
No check, together we got a checkmate
All hate gonna dissipate and fade away
To make room for a brand new day we got

We got one world 'til its time to fly
So it's one love 'til we say goodbye
We got one world its enough to share
‘Til we’re called home and we’re caught up in the air we got

One world
I'll look out for you, you look out for me
One world
Together we can be perfect harmony
One world
I'll look out for you, you look out for me
One world
And I’m a dedicate this song to everyone of God's children

One world oughta be more than enough
And if its not, is God looking in pure disgust?
Wondering what the dilly with the silly I see?
When I made each of these in the image of me
Everyday is a chance for a new stance
Like every song is the beginning of a new dance
And everyone of us was made to reflect the light
And glorify the most high so bright we got

You can come as you are
Love is yours
Love is ours
I am a witness
To sweet forgiveness
You will shine like a star
Burning bright where you are in our one world"
