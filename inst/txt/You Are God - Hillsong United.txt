Hillsong United

chorus :
You are God
You alive
I will worship You forever
2x

He know me before i took my first breath
and He know the day that i will breath the last
You're the Alfa Omega beginning and end
forever to You i sing

Chorus

Into Your hands i commit my spirit
You're the only one who satisfies my soul
You're the Alfa Omega beginning and end
forever to You I sing

Chorus"
