Just one look on Your face
Just one glance of Your eye
My whole world has changed (2x)

Oh I seek only to see Your face
I don't wanna go nowhere without You, God
Without Your presence
Oh, let me see Your face
The beauty of Your holiness, God
Take me into Your holy place

And only one word comes to mind
There's only one word to describe
(2x)

Holy, holy
Lord God Almighty
(2x)

And only one word comes to mind
There's only one word to describe
(4x)

Holy, holy
Lord God Almighty
(2x)

There is no one like You
You are holy
(2x)

Holy, holy
Lord God Almighty
(2x)

(We join with all of heaven singing
Holy holy (3x)
Take us in (3x), tonight)

Holy, holy
Lord God Almighty
(2x)

Take us into the holy place
Take us into the holy place tonight
(2x)

Purify our hearts (3x), God
Let the flame of Your heart
Become a flame upon our hearts tonight, God
Take us in

There is no one like You
You are holy, holy
(2x)

(Just sing out in your own words) (2x)

(Let us be a generation marked with holiness
Oh, a generation of people who know Your love
Who know Your holiness, God
Carriers of your presence
Carriers of your presence, God
A generation marked by Your love
A generation purified, set apart
Holy unto You, God)

Holy, holy
Lord God Almighty
(2x)"
