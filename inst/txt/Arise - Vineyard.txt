Vineyard

For you are good, your love endures forever
And we rejoice in your unfailing love
Consume our praise
With fire down from heaven
And fill us with your power from above

And arise, arise,
Arise O Lord, our God, arise

Arise Oh Lord, within our midst
As we declare your righteousness
Lift up the name that we confess
As we proclaim your holiness

Arise, arise, arise
Oh Lord, (oh Lord), our God, (our God)
Arise

Salvation comes from you alone
Oh Lamb of God, the Chosen One
That we might be your resting place
We worship you, we seek your face"
