"1" "Falling In Love With You
Vineyard

Going to love You through the pain

I'm trying to be like You
You're the truth I can't deny

Gonna fi nd my peace in You
Gonna love You when it hurts
(and)
Put my trust in You
You're everything to me
I give it all to You

Falling in love with You
Falling in love with You
I'm falling in love with You
Falling in love with You"
