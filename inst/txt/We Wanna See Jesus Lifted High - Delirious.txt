"1" "We Wanna See Jesus Lifted High
Delirious

We wanna see Jesus lifted high
A banner that flies across this land
that all might see the truth and know
He is the way to heaven

We wanna see
We wanna see
We wanna see Jesus lifted high


We wanna see Jesus lifted high
A banner that flies across this land
that all might see the truth and know
He is the way to heaven


We wanna see
We wanna see
We wanna see Jesus lifted high


Step by Step were moving forward
Little by little taking ground
Every prayer powerful weapon
Strongholds fall tumbling down and down and down

We wanna see
We wanna see

Were gonna see
Were gonna see
Were gonna see Jesus lifted high

We wanna see
Were gonna see
Were gonna se Jesus lifted high

Were gonna see Jesus lifted high"
