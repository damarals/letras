"1" "Don't Give Up On Me
Amy Grant

Don't give up on me,
Though I know at times it's hard to see;
All my many weaknesses
Might blind you,
I must remind you,

Don't give up on me,
Even when I act so selfishly,
All my views are all I see.
Yes, I know there's still so much of me,
But God is working constantly,
To shape me,
He'll remake me.

Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna make it.
I know it's hard for you to see.
Don't give up on me,
I couldn't take it.
If a part of me should keep you from seeing
The part of me that you'd start to believe in,
I'm changin' so please don't give up on me.

Don't give up on me,
Even when I fail so miserably.
Time and again I know
I stumble,
It makes me humble.

Don't give up on me.
But never let your love to be
Hanging on the things you see,
Counting all the times I fail to be
Everything you want from me;
I'm trying.
Hear me crying.

Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna make it.
I know it's hard for you to see.
Don't give up on me,
I couldn't take it.
If a part of me should keep you from seeing
The part of me that you'd start to believe in,
I'm changin' so please don't give up on me.

I know much more than you
How very weak I am.
But He believes in me,
And so I know you can.

When all my views are all I see,
Then I know there's still so much of me;
But God is working constantly
To shape me,
He'll remake me.

Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna make it.
I know it's hard for you to see.
Don't give up on me.
I couldn't take it.
If a part of me should keep you from seeing
The part of me that you'd start to believe in,
I'm changin' so please don't give up on me.

Don't give up one me.
I'm gonna make it.
I know it's hard for you to see.
Don't give up on me.
I couldn't take it.
If a part of me should keep you from seeing
The part of me that you'd start to believe in,
I'm changin' so please don't give up on me.
