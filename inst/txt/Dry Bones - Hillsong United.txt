Hillsong United

VERSE 1
You can take my dry bones
Breathe life into this skin
You called me by name
Raised me to life again

VERSE 2
You can calm the oceans
Speak peace into my soul
Take me as I am
Awaken my heart to beat again

CHORUS
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus
Alive in me

VERSE 3
You move in the unseen
You set the captives free
As I stand and sing
You’re breaking the chains off me

BRIDGE
Breathe in me Your life
I can feel You are close now
I can never hide
You are here and You know me
All I need is You
And I love You
I love You
I love You
I love You

Breathe in me Your life
‘Til Your love overtakes me
Open up my eyes
Let me see You more clearly
Falling on my knees
‘Til I love like You love
Like You love me
I love You"
