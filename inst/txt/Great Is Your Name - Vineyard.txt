"1" "Great Is Your Name
Vineyard

Great is Your name
You suffered such pain
So I could live
Free from my shame
You gave Your life
There on the cross
Before all men, You paid the cost

What kind of love would do this for me
(And) Who is this man dying for me?

Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord"
