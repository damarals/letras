"1" "We Cry Out
Jeremy Camp

Anthems fill the skies with praise
All your mighty works display Your glory
They tell of Your glory

We who called upon your name
Cannot be silent
We will praise
We will sing it out
We will sing it out

For we have seen the greatness
of Your glory be revealed
And we have seen all that You've done
And we can not be still

We will cry out to You
Your loving kindness and Your truth
It has delivered us
You have delivered us
Great is Your glory Lord
When nations learn of Your ways
They will bow down to You
We will bow down to You

Into all the world we take
The mystery of your saving grace
Shine the light into the darkness

We will cry out to you
You have delivered us
You have delivered us
Great is your glory lord
WHen nations learn of your ways
They will bow down to you
We will bow down to you
We will cry out
