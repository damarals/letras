"1" "When The Tears Fall
Newsboys

I've had questions without answers
I've known sorrow, I have known pain
But there's one thing that I'll cling to
You are faithful, Jesus You're true

When hope is lost, I'll call You Saviour
When pain surrounds, I'll call You healer
When silence falls, You'll be the song within my heart

In the lone hour of my sorrow
Through the darkest night of my soul
You surround me and sustain me
My defender, forevermore

And I will praise You, I will praise You
When the tears fall, still I will sing to You
And I will praise You, Jesus praise You
Through the suffering still I will sing

Oh yes, You are good to me
You've always been good to me
So trustworthy

How faithful and true
Sustain me through and through
You are hope and truth
You're my spring of living water
You're my spring of living water

In the lone hour You are there
And in all my sorrow You're there
You're my healer

Whose springs never fail
Be faithful and true
Like a spring it never fails
You're my spring it never fails"
