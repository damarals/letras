She gave it her Best
She tried to fit in
She tried to be cool
But she never could win
Her mom says she's great
The kids think she's weird
Honestly she wishes she could disappear

Why you try,
try to be like like the rest of them?
When you know there's so much more within
There's only one you
Here's what ya' gotta do

Whoa, whoa...

(CHORUS)
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's comming through your headphones
Anytime you feel alone, put on your headphones
Love, love's comming through your headphones
Lo-o-ove is comming through your headphones
Lo-o-ove is comming through your headphones

He gets in his car
He falls apart
It came to an end
And know it's breaking his heart
He wants to give up
wants to try again
Honestly he doesn't know what he's feeling

Hey, you might not see it with your eyes
But keep your head up to the sky
The sun is coming through
Here's what you gotta do

(CHORUS)

So keep your head up
high and dust of your shoulders
It's alright,no, it's not over
Love is here, it came to dry up all yout tears
Oh, can you feel it
Gotta belive it, gotta see it by your side
In the middle of the night
So keep your head up
high and dust of your shoulders
It's alright,no, it's not over

(CHORUS)

Twinkle, twinkle in your eye
Listen to this lollaby
The sun is shining in the sky
I see love it's in your eyes

This aint' the first time you felt like this
This aint' the first time,
This aint' the first time
This aint' the last time you'll feel like this
But it will be fine
if you can just smile"
