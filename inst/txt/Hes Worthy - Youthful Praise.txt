"1" "He's Worthy
Youthful Praise

Its time to give God all of the praise
Its time to praise his Ho-holy name
For all of the things he has done for us
Everybody give him all the praise
Bridge:
For his goodness, his mercy, and his favor
He's worthy of the praise (repeat 4x)
Vamp:
He's worthy
Let's praise the Lord
He's worthy
Come on let's praise the Lord
Vamp 2:
He is Worthy
Let's praise the Lord
Worthy
Come on let's praise the Lord"
