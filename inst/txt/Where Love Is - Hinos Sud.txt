"1" "Where Love Is
Hinos Sud

Where love is
There God is also
Where love is
We want tô be
Guide us, his truth tô follow
Help us obey him faithfully
Where love is
God is also
We think of him rev'rently
Teach us tô pray
tô talk whith him above
And know that he
will guide us with his love
The confort of loving arm aroud us
A song that makes us want tô sing
The happiness we feel when love has found us
\"Tis love we get when love we bring
Where love is
There God is also
Where love is
We want tô be
Guide us, his truth tô follow
Help us obey him faithfully
Where love is
God is also
And with him we want tô be
Show us and guide us tenderly
That we may dwell
with him eternally"
