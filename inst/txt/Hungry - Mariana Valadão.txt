"1" "Hungry
Mariana Valad√£o

Hungry I come to you
For I know You satisfy
I am empty but I know
Your love does not run dry
So I wait for You
So I wait for You

I've fallen on my knees
Offering all my needs
Jesus You're all
This heart is living for

Broken I run to You
For Your arms are open wide
I am weary but I know Your touch
Restores my life

So I wait for You
So I wait for You"
