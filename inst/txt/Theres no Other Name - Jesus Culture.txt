"1" "There's no Other Name
Jesus Culture

Your sing moves and shakes the ground
You beckon brings the rain in drought
Your glory spins the earth around
Your whisper makes Your fire fall down
There's no other name
The name that stands through the ages

There is no other name
There is no other name like Yours, Jesus
Like Yours, Jesus
Your word commands the winds and waves
Your touch revives the sick and lame
Your power wakes the dead again
Your love destroys the grip of sin

All generations
Will sing of Your goodness
All generations will know Your name
All glory and honor
Will be Yours forever
All glory and honor, we give to Your name"
