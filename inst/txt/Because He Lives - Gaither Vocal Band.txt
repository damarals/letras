"1" "Because He Lives
Gaither Vocal Band

God Sent His Son, They Called Him Jesus;
He Came To Love, Heal And Forgive.
He Lived And Died To Buy My Pardon;
An Empty Grave Is There To Prove My Savior Lives.

Chorus
Because He Lives
I Can Face Tomorrow
Because He Lives
All Fear Is Gone
Because I Know He Holds The Future
And Life Is Worth The Living
Just Because He Lives

How Sweet To Hold A Newborn Baby,
And Feel The Pride And Joy He Gives;
But Greater Still The Calm Assurance:
This Child Can Face Uncertain Day
Because He Lives.

Chorus

And Then One Day I'll Cross The River;
I'll Fight Life's Final War With Pain.
And Then, As Death Gives Way To Vict'ry,
I'll See The Lights Of Glory
And I'll Know He Reigns.

Chorus"
