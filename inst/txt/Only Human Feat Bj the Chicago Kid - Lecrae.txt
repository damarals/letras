Da-da
Da-da-da, da

Please forgive me if I mess up
Knowing that you watch is so much pressure
Still God I thank, I'll never let up (Let up)
So every day when I see the sun come up, I'ma say, let's get it
Get it done, every day
Provin' that I'm still Your son
If You hear me and You're with me
Heaven not too far, far as I can tell
You just gotta go through a little Hell

Ain't no prescription for my brokenness, no pills for hopelessness
I still pop them tryna cope with it, I cry from loneliness
Devil played his part and played me, I'm foolish, grew too lazy
God say, \"Take heed lest you fall, \" but I'm such an October baby
Need you to hold me down (Down)
World tryna slow me down (Down) , know me now
Know my vices, kryptonites, they entice me 'til I slowly drown
Now I'm on holy ground
Can't fight these battles alone, they after my home
They after my mind, they after my time
You said, \"I'm an heir\" they after the throne
I thought I was running from demons, but maybe I'm running from me and my tether is roamin', running from clones
We talking 'bout running the city, but most of us running from home
Running from trauma and poverty, I hit the lottery, I thought they'd leave me alone
Look at me, richer than ever, but poor as a beggar when you look inside of my soul
Broke the sacred rules and paid a lot of dues on my soul (Soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul)
Almost lost my family, drank the Devil's juice on my soul (Soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul)
Thought I was immune a superhuman, fool on my soul (Soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul)
If I lose my life somehow, I still don't lose on my soul (Soul)

Please forgive me if I mess up
Knowing that you watch is so much pressure
Still God I thank, I'll never let up (Let up)
So every day when I see the sun come up, I'ma say, let's get it
Get it done, every day
Provin' that I'm still Your son
If You hear me and You're with me
Heaven not too far, far as I can tell
You just gotta through a little Hell

Oh my God, how I beat the odds? How I beat the charge?
Oh my God, how You make the moon? How You speak the stars?
Oh my God, when they see my flaws, they gon' call me fraud
I was lost, blinded by applause, now I know my calling
Said I admit it, I'm countin' the minutes
They comin' to get it, go tell 'em I'm with it
They killed the Messiah, they don't have no limits
So what they gon' do to me? Give me my sentence
Or hit me with venom, I don't have opinions
All I got is patience and a couple pennies
I ain't independent, leanin' on the spirit
I know we gon' win it, so go hang the pennants
I was in a mansion goin' out my mind
Had the doctors on the line
Wifey cryin', momma cryin', we'll be fine, know I'm lyin'
I ain't wanna live, my babies need me live
Come too far to shut my eyes
But all this pain, I can't survive
But God said \"Hol' up, I got it, I do this\" (Yeah, yeah)
He lifted my head up then helped me get to it
He gave me the beauty for ashes, I blew it (Yeah, yeah)
I thought I was ruined, He started renewin'
I look at my life, I'm like, \"What is You doin'? \" (Yeah, yeah)
He look at my life, He like, \"Already knew it\"
And yet I still love you, I'm walking you through it (Yeah, yeah)
Your actions are foolish but I know you human (Human, human)

Please forgive me if I mess up
Knowing that you watch is so much pressure
Still God I thank, I'll never let up (Let up)
So everyday when I see the sun come up, I'ma say, let's get it
Get it done, every day
Provin' that I'm still Your son
If You hear me and You're with me
Heaven not too far, far as I can tell
You just gotta through a little Hell"
