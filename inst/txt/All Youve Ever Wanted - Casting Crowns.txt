"1" "All You've Ever Wanted
Casting Crowns

I just looked up today and
Realized how far away I am
From were you are

You gave me life worth dying for but
Between the altar and the door
I bought the lies that promised more
And here I go again

Lord I know I let you down
But somehow I will make you proud
I'll turn this sinking ship around
And make it back to you

But all my deeds and my good name
Are just dirty rags that tear and strain
To cover all my guilty stains
That you already washed away

Chorus
'cause all you've ever wanted
All you've ever wanted
All you've ever wanted was my heart
Freedoms arms are open
My chains have all been broken
Relentless love has called me from the start
And all you wanted was my heart

I was chasing healing
When I'd been made well
I was fighting battles
When you conquered hell
Living free but from a prison cell
Lord I lay it down today

I'll so stop living off of how I feel
And start standing on your truth revealed
Jesus is my strength my shield
And he will never fail me

Chorus
'cause all you've ever wanted
All you've ever wanted
All you've ever wanted
Was my heart
Freedoms arms are open
My chains have all been broken
Relentless love has called me from the start
And all you wanted was my heart

No more chains
I've been set free
No more fighting battles
You've won for me
Now in christ I stand complete

All you've ever wanted
All you've ever wanted
All you've ever wanted
Was my heart
(all you've ever wanted was my heart)

Freedoms arms are open
My chains have all been broken
Relentless love has called me from the start
And all you wanted was my heart

And all you wanted was my heart
(all you've ever wanted was my heart)
And all you wanted was my heart"
