"1" "Your Unfailing Love
Hillsong United

When the darkness fills my senses
When my blindness
Keeps me from Your touch
Jesus, come

When my burden keeps me doubting
When my memories
Take the place of You
Jesus, come

And I’ll follow you there
To the place where we meet
And I’ll lay down my pride
As You search me again

Your unfailing love
Your unfailing love
Your unfailing love
Over me again"
