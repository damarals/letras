In that fair land
there will be no more night
no sun or moon
for the Lamb of GOD is light
It's good to know
that He's prepared the way
to a bright and endless day

From this ol' world (from this ol' world to flee)
We're gonna live (to live eternally)
With Christ(with Christ our blessed Lord)
In home on high (in the heavenly home on high)
We'll shout (well shout)
And sing (and sing)
We'll walk (we'll walk)
And talk (and talk)
We'll shout (well shout)
And sing (and sing)
We'll walk (we'll walk)
And talk (and talk)
We'll Shout
and praise His name every day
(every day will be the same)

Oh my Lord
My burden bearer
My help in trouble
My joy in sorrow
My light in darkness
My sword and shield
Oh my Lord, What a time

From this Ol' world (from this ol'world to flee)
We're gonna live (to live eternaly)
With Christ (Christ our blessed Lord)
In home on high (in the heavenly home on high)
We'll shout (well shout)
And sing (and sing)
We'll walk (we'll walk)
And talk (and talk)
We'll shout (well shout)
