"1" "Home, Where I Belong
Gaither Vocal Band

They say heaven's pretty and living here is too
But if they said, Mark you're gonna have to choose between the two
I'd go home, going home where I belong

Sometimes when I'm dreaming it comes as no surprise
That if you look and see that homesick feeling in my eyes
I'm headed home, I'm going home where I belong

While I'm here I'll serve Him gladly and sing Him all these songs
I'm here, but not for long

When I'm feeling lonely, when I'm feeling blue
It's such a joy to know I am only passing through
I'm headed home, I'm going home where I'll finally belong

But while I'm here I'll serve Him gladly and sing Him all these songs
Well, I'm here, but not for long

And one day I'll be sleeping when death knocks on my door
And I'll awake to find that I'm not homesick anymore
I'll be home, finally be home where I belong"
