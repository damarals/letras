"x"
"1" "Still In Love
Kirk Franklin

Verse 1
That touch I felt was you,
I believe it's felt like something You would do
how You, You keep reminding me that You made me for yo,
I knew, that there would be some days that can't be guaranteed to be blue,
It's true, but then where would I be without opportunities to,
Watch you change my broken life,
Hear you tell me it's gon' be alright now,
See your plans come together in ways I can't even explain

Chorus
Together we been through hard times,
But Jesus I'm still in love with You,
I've had many loves in my life
But Jesus you make me feel brand new,
You know it's hard for me to believe
that You love me no matter what I do
So how I live, I hope you can see
that I'm in love with You

Verse 2
The morning sun was you,
I appreciate it just what I needed to get through cause you You knew I had a stressful day gotta get away with you, Jesus You
You make me happy if I wrote down all the things you do
The list would take forever I thought it might be better
to tell you why I smile is cause you,
You bring no drama in my life
It was dark but I can see the light now
Everything is so beautiful to me

Chorus

Bridge
[Hey DJ] Turn it up it feels so good to have somebody love you and your heart won't break
[Hey DJ] Turn it up if you've been through love
You're ready now to let go of yesterday
[If you can hear me] Get on up and get yourself together
He's callin you its all for you if you don't know Jesus is so 'n love with you

Rap
Yeah that's you just keep doing what you do
No one does me like you do that's why I'm so in love with you
Who? You, Yeah it's You and if I have to got through
As long as I'm with you I'm gone' be alright tonight cause itÂ´s for You

Chorus"
