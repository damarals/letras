"1" "Your Name High
Hillsong United

Your innocence forsaken
Upon that cross
You gave Yourself for us
Carried into Your freedom
Our broken past replaced in
A second chance
The chains have come undone
Death defied in the Father's love

CHORUS:
We are living to make
Your Name high Jesus
Living to make Your Name high Jesus
You gave what the world couldn't offer us
Say what they want
Say what they want
We are free

The atmosphere is changing
Oh can You hear
The people rising up
In the hope of Your freedom
Our former ways are breaking
We seek Your face
God let Your kingdom come
In our praises be lifted up

With eyes on high we praise You
And with one voice we come together
Our one desire is to praise You
And lift You up in our surrender
