"1" "Conquering The Impossible
Jamily

Just believe it's time to really win
And this strength and power comes from your in
You can also touch the distant sky...
If you believe

Just believe that no one of us
Has been born able to be the most
In our dreams we should trust...

And standing out the limits
Let's climbing up the fortress
And conquering the impossible by faith...

CHORUS
The champion, the winner God gives you wings you
Fly away
The champion, the winner is this faith that makes
You inbeatable
That shows you what you are...

Just believe that no one of us
Has been born able to be the most
In our dreams we should trust...

And standing out the limits
Let's climbing up the fortress
And conquering the impossible by faith...

CHORUS
The champion, the winner God gives you wings you
Fly away
The champion, the winner is this faith that makes
You inbeatable
That shows you what you are...

So the records you can break
And the best of yourself you can make
Go and win...

CHORUS...(2x)"
