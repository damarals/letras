"1" "My God
Hillsong United

Your faithful love
has always been there for me
the greatest love
that I have ever known
what can I give to you
for all You’ve given to me
You gave it all
and You are all I need

Pre-Chorus:
You are my king, You are my God
the praises I bring
come from my heart

Chorus:
This is for You
for all You’ve done for me
and I wanted to show You
how much You mean
my God, my God"
