"1" "I'm a Lover Of Your Presence
Jesus Culture

Let this be a sacrifice let me dedicate my life to worship you
Won't you let this be a sacrifice let me dedicate my life to worship you

I'm a lover of your presence
I'm a lover of your presence
I'm a lover of your presence

A passions stirring deep inside, you're all that really satisfies, we worship you

We're lovers of your presence
We're lovers of your presence
We're lovers of your presence
And all we wanna be and is all we wanna be

Cuz I was made for love, I was made for love, I was made for loving you
I know that I was made for love, I was made for love, and I was made for
Loving you"
