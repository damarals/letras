"1" "The Storm Is Over Now
Kirk Franklin

[Chorus:]

Its Over Now
Its Over Now
I Feel Like I Can
Make It,
The Storm is Over Now
[Repeat]

[Verse 1:]

Its Over Now
Its Over Now
I Feel Like I Can
Make It,
The Storm is Over Now

[Verse 2:]

No More Cloudy Days
They're All Gone Away
I Feel Like I Can
Make It,
The Storm is Over Now

[Verse 3:]

If I walk Alone
I'm Not On My Own
I Feel Like I Can
Make It,
The Storm is Over Now

[Chorus]

If I walk Alone
I'm Not On My Own
I Feel Like I Can
Make It,
The Storm is Over Now

[chorus]

no more cloudy days
the storm is over now [repeat]

no more crying at night
the storm is over now

No More Sickness In My Body
The Storm is Over Now [Repeat]

no more crying at night
the storm is over now [3 times]

no more tears and sorrow
no more heartache and pain

no more suffering
no more, it's over now"
