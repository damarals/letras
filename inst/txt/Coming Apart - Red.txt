"1" "Coming Apart
Red

[Verse 1]
The world was brighter at the beginning
When I lived inside a dream
Is it too late now for you to see me?
When I'm breaking at the seams

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the one thing I can't, I can't lose
You're my one thing

[Chorus]
Hold on
I'm coming apart
I'm gone
But not too far
Hold on
I'll be strong
And don't give up on me today
Don't give up on me today
I'm coming apart
Don't give up on me
I'm coming apart
Don't give up on me

[Verse 2]
I'm still clinging to the memory
Is it fooling, fooling me
My only blessing, what I'm forgetting
Wish I could take it all away"
