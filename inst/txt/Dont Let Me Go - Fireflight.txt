Questions there with no answer
Nothing's changed, I'm still waiting for someone to care
No escape from the cancer
Torn inside from the bite of a ridge in the sand

No escape from the cancer
Torn inside from the bite of a ridge in the sand

I'm slipping under
Straight to bottom
Head underwater
I'm slipping under
Straight to bottom
Straight to bottom

I've lost control (I've lost control)
Don't let me go (please don't let go)
No strength is left in my soul
You're the only hope left to hold
Don't let me go

All the pain, all the passion
I was wasted, afraid to admit I was wrong
Try to hide with distraction
Just disguising the lies that I love to believe

I'm slipping under
Straight to bottom
Head underwater
I'm slipping under
Straight to bottom
Straight to bottom

I've lost control (I've lost control)
Don't let me go (please don't let go)
No strength left in my soul
You're the only hope left to hold
Don't let me go

No matter where I run or how far I fall
You're right by my side through it all, all, all
No matter where I run or how far I fall
You're right by my side through it all, all, all

No matter where I run or how far I fall
You're right by my side through it all, all, all
No matter where I run or how far I fall
You're right by my side through it all, all, all

You're the only hope left to hold
Don't let me go (please don't let go)
Don't let me go (please don't let go)
Don't let me go

Don't let me, don't let me go"
