Ricardo SÃ¡

god sees your heart
He fills it with his compassion ond knows when you are feeling down
There is one thing he can't do: It's to stop loving you
Because he knoes what a wretch can do
Tears and sweat of souls who fight alone
Only God understands what can cause you pain
Think about the Lord, rely on His love and know
He's faithful, just is His love
Don't look down on you anymore
Don'teven wanna blame the others
Say that today, that today I shall not sin anymore
Raise you hands and open up your heart
Go back to the Lord and be open to restoration
With Christ you will overcome, get over all the problems you have
Just trust in His love an a new man will be born"
