"1" "We Cry Out
Jesus Culture

Oh Lord, we cry out, we’ve been lost
We need your mercies, oh God
We repent for our ways and we turn to you again
Oh Lord, we cry out, we’ve been lost
Change our hearts to yours, oh God
We repent for our sin and we turn to you again

Chorus:
Oh God, we cry out, for your mercy
Oh God, we cry out, for your grace
Oh God, we cry out, set us free
Oh God, we cry out, once again"
