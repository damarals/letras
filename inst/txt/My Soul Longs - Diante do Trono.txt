Diante do Trono

Call us ever closer to Your presence, to Your glory
Take us so much deeper past the altar to Your glory

Spirit fall down on us As we come near to Your glory
Cover us with mercy Children longing for Your glory

Chorus
My soul longs for You
Longs with every step
Longs with every breath
My soul burns for You
Burns with Your desire
Burns with holy fire

Spirit fall down on us As we come near to Your glory
Cover us with mercy Children longing for Your glory

Chorus
(Free worship)

My soul longs for You Oh

Bridge (4times)
Glory, come down
Heaven all around
All around

Chorus

Lord Jesus"
