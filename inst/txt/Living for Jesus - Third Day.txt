Lyrics & Music by Mac Powell

From the recording: Third Day, Track #10.

Sometimes things don't work out quite the way
that you wanted them to
Sometimes people don't do all the things
that you wanted them to
There are time when
the answers aren't easy to see
Sometimes we're on a road
going back to a place we never wanted to be

Chorus:
Well that's alright
I'm just fine. Done made up my mind
that I'm livin for Jesus

When I'm alone and feeling down
Now, down so deep in my heart
I turn to Jesus and ask Him
for a brand new start
He's the reason for my life
being something better and new
And now I've finally found a love
that is proven tried and true

Repeat chorus
"
