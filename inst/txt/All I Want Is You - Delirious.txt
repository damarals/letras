"1" "All I Want Is You
Delirious

Did I tell you it was wine when really it was water?
I walked upon the wine it went to my head and I faltered
I've tried to heal your bones I've tried to tell your future
Maybe I should just call up my friends
And play some music, be myself

Well I've been thinking about what do I and say
To climb my way down this ladder keep me
from flying away
And if there's a preacher here will you preach
the truth?
I want to know more about Jesus (yes I do)

All I want is you (all I want is you)
All I want is you now
All I want is you (all I want is you)
All I want is you

Did I tell you it was fine to come and
question nothing?
To look upon the sign as the answer to it all
Oh why do I feel poor?
Why do I feel nervous?
I think it's time to put on my God shoes
And do what i'm here for
Raise the flag again

Can I be free from the chains of my religion
They wrap around my head and blind my eyes of faith
And I feel dangerous 'cos I hunger for the truth
This tight rope's swinging high
No turning back
Teach me to fly"
