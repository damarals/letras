Vineyard Brasil

I need You like the rain
Come to me and sing again
I long for Your love so much
Am I?ve wanted Your pure touch

You are beautiful, beautiful
You?re beautiful, beautiful
So beautiful, so beautiful

I need You to be here
Come to me, I can feel You near
I love You, You are my hope
You love me as Your own

You are beautiful, beautiful
You?re beautiful, beautiful
So beautiful, so beautiful"
