Take 6

I'm on my way to canaan land
I'm on my way to canaan land
I'm on my way to the canaan land
I'm on my way to canaan land, I'm on my way

If my mother don't go
I'll journey on
If she don't go
I'll journey on

If my father don't go
I'll journey on
If he don't go
I'll journey on (and on)

I'm on my way to canaan land
I'm on my way (on my way) to canaan land
(Lord) I'm on my way to the canaan land
I'm on my way to canaan land, I'm on my way

If you don't go
To the canaan land
Don't hinder me (I just gotta make it in)
I'm on my way
I am on my way to the canaan land
I'm on my way to canaan land
If you don't go
(Don't hinder me)
I'll journey on
I'm on my way to canaan land

(ooh) If you don't go
I'll journey on
To canaan land
I'm on my way

(Spanish)
Si tú no vas
Apártate
Si tú no vas
Yo seguiré
Si tú no vas
A canaán
Camino voy

(Portuguese)
Se você não for
Saia da frente
Se você não for
Vou continuar
Se você não for
A canaã
Eu vou pra lá

If you don't go
Don't hinder me
If you don't go
I'll journey on and on
If you don't go
To canaan land
I'm on my way

Repeat and fade"
