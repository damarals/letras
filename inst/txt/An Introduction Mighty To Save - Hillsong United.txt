Let us sing to our GOD.
Come before his presence with thanksgiving...
For the LORD is the great God.
In his hand are the deep places of the earth,
the heights of the hills are his also.
The sea is his, for he made it:
and his hands formed the dry land.
[Psalm 95:1-5]


Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Host;
the whole earth is full of his glory
[Isaiah 6:1parte b]


One thing I have desired of the LORD, that will I seek;
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life,
to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.
[...] I will Sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD
Your face, LORD, I will seek.
[Psalm 27:4]"
