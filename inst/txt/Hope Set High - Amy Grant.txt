I've got my hope set high
That's why I came tonight
I need to see the truth
I need to see the light.

I've got my hope set high
That's why I came tonight
I need to see the truth
I need to see the light
And I can do my best
And pray to the Father
But the one thing I ought to know by now

When it all comes down
When it all comes down
If there's anything good that happens in life
It's from Jesus.

You know that when it all comes down
When it all comes down
If there's anything good that happens in life
It's from Jesus.

I've got my hope set high
And like a star at night
Out of the deepest dark
It shines the purest light.

I've got my hope set high
Beyond the wrong and right
I need to see the truth
I need to see the light.
Cause I can do my best
And pray to the Father
But the one thing I ought to know by now

When it all comes down
When it all comes down
If there's anything good that happens in life
It's from Jesus.

I'll tell you when it all comes down
When it all comes down
If there's anything good that happens in life
It's from Jesus.
