Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
When I feel afraid think I lost my way
Still You're there right besisde me
Nothing will I fear
As long as You are near and please be near me to the end

Chorus:
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path

I will not forget your love for me and yet
My heart forever is wandering
Jesus be my guide and hold me to Your side
And I will love You to the end

Nothing will I fear
As long as You are near and please be near me to the end

Chorus:
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
And a light unto my path You're the light unto my path"
