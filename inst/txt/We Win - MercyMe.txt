MercyMe

I don't, have to know you, just to know you
Have the [?] to some point or place
Well, I can relate
And you're wondering, if it's worth it
Heartbroken, feeling worthless
Oh the hurt is too great
Like a punch in the face

But don't forget
We'd something else in common
Bigger than all our pain and all our problems

[?]
It's not over
Don't give up, don't throw in the towel
Just remember, who you belong to
Let Me remind you
[?]
We win
Woah, we win

We get pushed down, we were beat up
So our great lives, [gonna keep us?]
Up against the ropes
But hang on, there's hope
'Cause if Christ is inside us [?]
Deep down you know
How the story goes

[?]
It's not over
Don't give up, don't throw in the towel
Just remember, who you belong to
Let Me remind you
[?]
We win
Woah, we win
We win
Woah, we win

Hey, no stopping us
He's not done with us
We are more
More than conquerors
Hey, no stopping us
He's not done with us
We, are
More than conquerors!

Just remember, who you belong to
Let Me remind you
[?]
We win
Woah, we win
We win
Woah, we win

Hey, no stopping us
He's not done with us
We are more
More than conquerors
Hey, no stopping us
He's not done with us
We, are
More than conquerors!

Hey, no stopping us
He's not done with us
We are more
More than conquerors
Hey, no stopping us
He's not done with us
We, are
More than conquerors!"
