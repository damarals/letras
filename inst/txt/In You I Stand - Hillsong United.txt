Hillsong United

Verse:
I will praise You Lord (with all I have now)
Praise You Lord (Iâ€™ll sing and shout Your Name)
For all my days

You are Holy Lord (I bow my knee and)
Holy Lord (I pray to You and)
Worship You My King

Chorus:
And I will sing a new song
Songs of hope, songs of love
Enlarge my heart
Increase in You, decrease in me
Let Your grace be my guide
With peace, like new wine
Saving my soul, letting me know
That my life is in Your hands
In You my God I stand

Bridge:
And my hope is in You
And all I want to do
Is to know You more, Jesus"
