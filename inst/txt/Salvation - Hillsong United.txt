Hillsong United

Verse 1:
Sal - vat - ion!
Your grace has set me free
Delivered, saved and sanctified
Redeemed, forgiven, justified
Sal - vat - ion!
Your grace has rescued me
I've come to put my trust in the Lord


Verse 2:
Salvation!
Your blood it covers me
Renewed and raised and purified
Baptised, restored and glorified
Salvation!
Your word transforming me
I've come to put my trust in the Lord


Chorus:
I'm walking step by step
I'm reading line by line
Faith to faith
I'm praying all the time
I'm singing Praise Your Name
I know I'm not the same
Heaven opens Spirit falls
I'm saved in Jesus' Name
