"1" "Sing A Song
Take 6

When you feel down and out
Sing a song
It'll make your day
Here's a time to shout
Sing a song
It'll make your way

Sometimes it's hard to care
Sing a song
It'll make your day
Smile so hard to bare
Sing a song
It'll make your way

Chorus
Sing a song, sing a song
Sing a song, sing a song

It will bring your heart to believing
Sing a song
It'll ,ake your day
Life ain't about no retreating
Sing a song
It'll make your way

Give yourself what you need
Sing a song
It'll make your day
Smile, smile, smile and believe
Sing a song
It'll make a way"
