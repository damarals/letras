Verse 1:

Come and rest here
Come and lay your burdens down
Come and rest here
There is refuge for you now

You'll find His peace
And know you're not alone anymore
He is near
You'll find His healing
You're heart isnt shattered anymore
He is here

Chorus :

Breathe in
Breathe out
You will
You will find Him here

Bridge:

I will rest in You

Outro:

You will find Him
You will find Him here
You will find Him
You will find Him here"
