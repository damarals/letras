Youthful Praise

The Alpha and Omega
The Beginning and End
The God of All Creation
And My Personal Friend
O Lord, You've been good to me
You came to rescue and to set me free
O God, What can I say?
Your loving kindness blesses every day.
My Lord and My God
My Lord and My God
O Father, how did it feel
To give your only Son my sin to repeal?
O Jesus, why did you take it?
Now through your suffering I know I can make it
My Lord and My God
My Lord and My God
The Alpha and Omega
The Beginning and End
The God of All Creation
And My Personal Friend
O Spirit, give me Your leading
Give me the power and direction I'm needing
O Lord, I'm not deserving
But with my every breath I want to be serving
My Lord and My God
My Lord and My God"
