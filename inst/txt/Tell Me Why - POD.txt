"1" "Tell Me Why
P.O.D.

A day with no glory
A heart filled with fear
Repeating his story to make ourselves ?clear?
A voice is unheard when it shouts from the hills
Your king in his castle never died on these fields
There’s blood on your hands, a smile on your face
Wicked intention, there’s money to be made
A room with no windows and a heart that can’t feel
Shame with no convictions and a view ?to a kill?

Tell me why, why must we fight
Why must we kill in the name of what we think is right
And no more
No war
‘Cause how do you know?

The hate in your eyes
The lies on your tongue
A hand that kills the innocent, so quick to do wrong
The belly is full while we fight for what remains
The rich getting richer while the poor become slaves
We kill our own brothers, the truth is never told
If victory is freedom, then the truth is untold
Surrender your soldiers like everyone else
If love is my religion, don’t speak for myself

Tell me why, why must we fight
Why must we kill in the name of what we think is right
And no more
No war
‘Cause how do you know?
And how do you know?
And how do you know?
And how do you know?
And how do you know? (How do…)

Please tell me why, why must we fight
Why must we kill in the name of what we think is right
And no more
No war
‘Cause how do you know?

I'm living this life,
I'm given these lies
And how do I die in the name of what you think is right?
And no more
Oh Lord
‘Cause how do we know?
And how do we know?"
