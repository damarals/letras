"1" "Come On
Take 6

There used to be a time when i would blame somebody else
For everything that happened to me
Nothing ever happened 'til i turned and asked myself i said, \"self,
What’s wrong me?\"

I can't help it, i can't fight it, don't want to hide it
The problem seems to be me
Then i remembered what the good book said
To really live you got to be dead
So i asked for help, died to self
And i've got the victory

Come on everybody
We're just getting’ started
Rockin' the party
‘cause we got the victory
Come on everybody
We're dancin' to glory
Rockin' the party
‘cause we got the victory

Thought i knew it all always teachin' somebody else
Like the perfect one was me, myself, and i
When it fell apart i was standing all by myself and i found the answer
To the question why

I can't help it, i can't fight it, don't want to hide it
The problem seems to be me
Then i remembered what the good book said
To really live you got to be dead
So i asked for help, died to self
And i've got the victory

Come on everybody
We're just getting’ started
Rockin' the party
‘cause we got the victory
Come on everybody
We're dancin' to glory
Rockin' the party
‘cause we got the victory

This life is a journey, the process of learning
That god is the answer and love is the key
The prize is waiting for you and for me
Let’s cross the finish line and claim the victory

Come on everybody
We're just getting’ started
Rockin' the party
‘cause we got the victory
Come on everybody
We're dancin' to glory
Rockin' the party
‘cause we got the victory

Anybody wanna win?
Say yeah
It's a victory party
‘cause i know i got the victory!

Come on everybody
We're just getting’ started
Rockin' the party
‘cause we got the victory
Come on everybody
We're dancin' to glory
Rockin' the party
‘cause we got the victory"
