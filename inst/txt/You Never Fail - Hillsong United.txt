"1" "You Never Fail
Hillsong United

When waters rise all around me
When the mountains stand in the path I see
I look to love that's unfailing
I look to grace that is all I need

Oh call
Call upon the Name
Jesus Christ the only name that saves

For there is no one like our God
There's no one like our God
There's nothing that can stand against you
There's no stronghold You can't break
No life that You can't save
Our God will never fail

Your light will shine through the darkness
Your world will calm every crashing wave
My hope it lives in your promise
My faith it stand on the empty graves

Oh call
Call upon the Name
Jesus Christ the only name that saves

For there is no one like our God
There's no one like our God
There's nothing that can stand against you
There's no stronghold You can't break
No life that You can't save
Our God You never fail

Strong through every trial
Faithful through the night
Our God will never fail

Anchor through the flood
You keep holding on
I know you'll never fail
Jesus you'll never fail"
