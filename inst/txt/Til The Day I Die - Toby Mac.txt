"1" "Til The Day I Die
Toby Mac

I'll keep swinging for the fences
It's like this heart is defenseless
Against the passion that's pumpin' through my veins
Blood, sweat, tears, it's a callin'
And if I can't walk, then I'm crawlin'
It might flicker, but they can't kill the flame

I can't stop
I can't quit
It's in my heart
It's on my lips
I can't stop, no
I can't quit
It's in my heart, yeah
I'm all in

Til the wheels fall off
Til the spotlight fades
I will lift your banner high
I will lift your banner high
And til the walls crash in
For the rest of my days
I'll lay it all on the line
Til the day I die
Til the day I die
Til the end of the line
Til the day I die
It's your name I'll glorify

It's runnin' deeper than the ocean
This ain't religion, it's devotion
365, Every minute, everyday
So in the middle of the madness
They can stretch me out like canvas
But I ain't ever gonna fit in their frame

Til I die and they put me in the coffin
Don't matter if I'm on the road or if I'm recordin'
Tell me what you think about me
That really ain't important
You know Imma represent, um
I ain't playin'
Can't afford to
I only got one life and I get it though
And this is not an act, not a movie, not a tv show
I don't know what quittin' means, I don't ever take it slow
You know I'm on the grind, me and toby in the studio
Do it for the king, what you know about that?
Say you goin' harder, mm I doubt that'
You say you doin' work
But you're asking where the couch at
How you doin' work when you asking where the couch at?
God is not a crutch, you can use him when you wanna
You only look to heaven
When you goin' through some drama
And when they goin' through some problems
And that's the only time they call him
I guess I don't understand that life, wonder why?
Cause' I'm all in
Til the day I die"
