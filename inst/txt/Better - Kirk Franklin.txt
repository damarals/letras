"x"
"1" "Better
Kirk Franklin

Verse 1
If I could I, I'd get away
far from all this trouble I see everyday
Nobody wants to show their face
This life is like a, like a masquerade
I know you love me
I know you care
but while I'm hurting I just need to know your there
Watchin over me and I feel your tellin me
[Chorus:]
Count it all joy, always remember, life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper, things will get better it's gonna get better
[Verse 2:]
Persecuted, pushed away, didn't think I'd live to see another day
cried some tears and couldn't pray and when I tried at times I couldn't find the words to say, but now
I'm stronger, because of you without you Jesus I never could've made it through
thank you for watchin me lovin me and tellin me
[Chorus: (x2)]
Count it all joy, always remember, life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper, things will get better it's gonna get better
[Bridge:]
Life sometimes may change and nobody wants to feel pain, but it came to help you grow and this one thing
you need to know
God's in love with you and he'll never let you go
[Chorus: (x2)]
Count it all joy always remember, life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper, things will get better it's gonna get better
it's gonna get better
it's gonna get better
it's gonna get better
it's gonna get better
it's gonna get better
it's gonna get better
it's gonna get better
