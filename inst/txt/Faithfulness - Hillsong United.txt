Hillsong United

From rising sun till kingdom come
Your faithful love is unfailing
Though shadows turn and tempests stir
Still you oh God is unchanging
Through every hour I will recall
My hope is Jesus

Great is your faithfulness
Great is your faithfulness
I lift my eyes
I won't forget
How great your faithfulness

When battle's near I will not fear
Your promises are unshaken
My faith is sure of nothing more
Than christ alone, my portion
Through every hour, I will recall
All my hope is Jesus

There'll be a season for joy and weeping
In everything our God is faithful
His arms are open
I will come running
Now and always our God is faithful

I won't forget your faithfulness
I won't forget your faithfulness"
