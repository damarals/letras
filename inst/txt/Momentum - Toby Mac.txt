"1" "Momentum
Toby Mac

Somebody said you better let go
'Cause they said so
But I could never let this thing go
Don't they even know what that means
They call me obscene
Say I wear my faith on my sleeve
But I ain't here to seek no glory
End of story, I know the judge and the jury
People always gotta ask who, what, when, and why
But never wanna step to the light
So I hear you say you wanna come and get some
Should I mention I got your attention
Know that I'm a man on a mission, my position is
Momentum
Been on a roll for two thousand years or so
We've got momentum baby
Livin' on the edge of obnoxious
They call me raucous
I'm a freak, I can't stop this
Ardently enthused about God
No hand-me-down nod
Your gonna get all I got
High-steppin' from the twenty on in
Knees to my chin
I'm rollin' deep in momentum
Burnin' with the hard core flame
No shame in this game
I'm followin' my heart not my brain
Been on a roll
Cause we got souls that won't die
And this party ain't over 'til we take flight
You've been told that we come bold on this side
You ain't never known the dilly 'til we testify
Cause have you ever heard of turnin' water into wine
And have you ever heard of givin' sight back to the blind
It's undeniable we're droppin' the Truth on this track
Cause once you start an avalanche there ain't no turnin' back"
