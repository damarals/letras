Newsboys

All hail the power of Jesus' name
Let angels prostrate fall
Bringing forth the royal diadem
And crown him lord of all
Bringing forth the royal diadem
And crown him lord of all

Ye chosen seed of israel? S race
Ye ransomed from the fall
Hail him who saves you by his grace
And crown him lord of all!
Hail him who saves you by his grace
And crown him lord of all!

You're lord of all!
You're lord of all!

Let every kindred, every tribe
On this terrestrial ball
To him all majesty ascribe
And crown him lord of all!
To him all majesty ascribe
And crown him lord of all!
And crown him lord of all!
And crown him lord of all!"
