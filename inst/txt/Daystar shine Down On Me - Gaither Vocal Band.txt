"1" "Daystar (shine Down On Me)
Gaither Vocal Band

Lily of the Valley,
Let your sweet aroma fill my life
Rose of Sharon
Show me how to grow
In beauty in God's sight
Fairest of ten thousand
Make me a reflection of your light
Daystar shine down on me
Let your love shine through me in the night

Lead me Lord, I'll follow.
Anywhere you open up the door
Let your word speak to me,
Show me what I've never seen before
Lord I want to be your witness,
You can take what's wrong and make it right
Daystar shine down on me,
Let your love shine through me in the night

Lord I've seen a world that's dying
Wounded by the master of deceit
Groping in the darkness,
Haunted by the years of past defeat
But when I see you standing near me, Lord
Shining with compassion in your eyes
I pray Jesus shine down on me
Let your love shine through me in the night

Lead me Lord, I'll follow
Anywhere you open up the door
Let your word speak to me,
Show me what I've never seen before
Lord I want to be your witness, Y
You can take what's wrong and make it right
Daystar shine down on me,
Let your love shine through me in the night"
