Red

Enemy, familiar friend
My beginning and my end
Broken truth, whispering lies
And it hurts again
What I fear and what I try
Words I say and what I hide
All the pain, I want it to end
But I want it again

And it finds me
The fight inside is coarsing through my veins
And it's raging
The fight inside is breaking me again

It's still the same, pursuing pain
Isn't worth the lie I've gained
We both know how it will end
But I do it again

And it finds me
The fight inside is coarsing through my veins
And it's raging
The fight inside is hurting me again
And it finds me
The war within me pulls me under
And without you
The fight inside is breaking me again

And it finds me
The war within me pulls me under
And without you
The fight inside is breaking me again

Oh, it's everything
Oh, it's everything
Oh, it's everything
Oh, it's everything
Oh, it's everything
Oh"
