"1" "Carry Me To The Cross
Kutless

When the path is daunting
And every step exhausting
I'm not alone, I'm not alone,
No no

I feel You draw me closer
All these burdens on my shoulder
I'm not alone, I'm not alone
You pull me from this place

(Chorus)

Hallelujah!
You carry me every day
You carry me all the way
Hallelujah!
You carry me to the
You carry me to the cross

How Your love has moved me, yeah
To the foot of all your glory
I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm not alone

Hallelujah!
You carry me every day
You carry me all the way
Hallelujah!
You carry me to the
You carry me to the cross

All of these cities You have built
And every cathedral You have filled
To all of creation YOu gave life
With YOur hands
And with those hands You comfort me
You lift me up from my knees
And carry me
You carry me


Hallelujah!
You carry me every day
You carry me all the way
Hallelujah!
You carry me to the
You carry me to the cross"
