To say Your love is healing me?
Just a glimpse of Your grace
And my whole world is changed
Forever and completely

I'm in love with You
I'm in love with You
I'm in love with You
I'm in love with You

By the love that You have poured out over my soul
Restored, I am made new
Father You only You

I'm in love with You
I'm in love with You
I'm in love with You
I'm in love with You
I'm in love with You
