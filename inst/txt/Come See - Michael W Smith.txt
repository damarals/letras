"1" "Come See
Michael W. Smith

Come see
Come see with spirit eyes
Come see
The door is open

Come near
Come weary and ashamed
Come near
His arms are open
His arms are open

Come live
Come live in freedom here
Come live
The chains are broken

Come rest
Come take his gift of grace
Come rest
The word is spoken
The word is spoken

Come see
Come see with spirit eyes
Come see
The door is open

Come home
Come lay your burdens down
Come home
His arms are open
His arms are open
His arms are open"
