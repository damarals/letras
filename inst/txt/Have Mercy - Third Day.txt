Third Day

Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day

From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #6.

My will won't break, it barely bends
Same old sinner, the same old sin
On my knees to plead again
Confessions trial, where to begin?

Have mercy, on me a sinning man
Lord have mercy, on me a sinning man

If it's true that the wages of sin is death
Then I've earned quite enough to quit
The reward I deserve I'd surely get
Were it not for you to pay my debt

Oh, I don't think I can take this further
Oh, if it's not one thing it's another"
