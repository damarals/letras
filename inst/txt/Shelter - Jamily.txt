You are my shelter
Hold me tight
I feel your protection
No matter where I go

No words can describe it
Your grace and mercy
Cause even though my mistakes
You make my life brand new again

And my soul
Yearns for you lord
Shout for you lord
Worship you
And my heart
Lives for you lord
Sing for you lord
Beat for you
I worship you

You are my shelter
Hold me tight
I feel your protection
No matter where I go

No words can describe it
Your grace and mercy
Cause even though my mistakes
You make my life brand new again

My heart beats for you
With the strength of my soul
My heart beats for you
With the strenght of my soul

Beat for you lord
Shout for you lord
Worship you
And my heart
Lives for you lord
Sing for you lord
Beat for you

And my heart
Lives for you lord
Sing for you lord
Beat for you
I worship you"
