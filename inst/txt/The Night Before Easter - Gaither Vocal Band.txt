"1" "The Night Before Easter
Gaither Vocal Band

The night was so different from all the rest
And a silence covers the Earth;
The stars have no glimmer, the moon tries to hide,
For in death lies the man of their birth.

Chorus:

Then a stone moves,
the Earth shakes (and) birds start singing,
The sun shines,
the Earth warms (for) new life it's bringing;
A little boy stops crying, a mother is smiling,
For death could not hold their King

In a room filled with sorrow, a mother cries
For Jesus, her Son now is gone;
Her child sent from heaven was taken away,
Heart broken she feels all alone.

Repeat Chorus

At the feet of his mother a little boy cries
Saying \"'momma' I don't understand;\"
I remember the look of love in His eyes,
That I saw, by the touch of His hand.

Repeat Chorus

The King of all ages, the Giver of life,
For a moment lies silent and still;
But a power sent from heaven comes breaking the night,
And death must bow to His will.

Repeat Chorus

Optional Ending:

When death could not hold their King."
