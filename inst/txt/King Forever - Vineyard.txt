Vineyard

Let the sea resound
Let the Heavens tell of the glory of You
We're looking to Your throne
We're lost in awe of You

You are faithful God
Your amazing love is sung throughout the earth
We come before You now praising Your name
Lord, You will always reign

Hallelujah, King forever
Hallelujah, friend and Saviour"
