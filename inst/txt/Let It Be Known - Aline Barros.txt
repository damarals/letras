Aline Barros

Come on let's turn it up
We're gonna sing it out
For all the world to hear
Oh oh oh whoa

There's love for everyone
A new day has began
Something to shout about

Let it be known
That our god saves
Our god reigns
We lift you up up
Let it be known
That love has come
Love has won
We lift you up up up oh

Nothing can stop us now
No one can keep us down
We've found our voice again
Oh oh oh whoa

No need for fear and shame
There's power in his name
Come on let freedom reign

Let it be known
That our god saves
Our god reigns
We lift you up up
Let it be known
That love has come
Love has won
We lift you up up up oh

Yo
Let it be known, let it be known
That our god reigns, our god rose from cross to the throne
Let it be known, let everybody know
That love has won, love has come

We lift your name up higher and higher
We lift your name up
We shout your name out louder and louder
We shout it out now

Shout it out!

We lift your name up higher and higher
We lift your name up, Jesus
We shout your name out louder and louder
We shout it out now

Let it be known
That our god saves
Our god reigns
We lift you up up
Let it be known
That love has come
Love has won
We lift you up up up

Let it be known
That our god saves
Our god reigns
We lift you up up
Let it be known
That love has come
Love has won
We lift you up up up oh

Let it be known, let it be known
That our god reigns, our god rose from cross to the throne
Let it be known, let it be known
That love has come, love has won
(Let it be known)
Let it be known, let it be known
That our god rose from cross to the throne
Let it be known, let everybody know
That love has come, love has won"
