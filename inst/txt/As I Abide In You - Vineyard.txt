"1" "As I Abide In You
Vineyard

(Men) You make my joy complete
(Women) As I abide in You
(Men) You fill my every need
(Women) As I abide in You

CHORUS:
I will remain in You for all of my days.
You will shelter me as I give You praise
I will sing of Your love
I will bring all of my love

(Men) You answer every prayer
(Women) As I abide in You
(Men) I fell Your love and care
(Women) As I abide in You"
