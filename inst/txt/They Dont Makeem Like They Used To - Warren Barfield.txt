"1" "They Don't Make'em Like They Used To
Warren Barfield

My grandma, she was fifteen when she married
The boy who would be my granddad
And he never, even touched her, until they said I do
And he finally took her hand
And they filled a home with children
My daddy, was the sixteenth one
And even after granddad died
She never gave another her love

They don't make'em like they used to
You don't hear stories like that, these days
They don't make'em like they used to
The kind of love that last, always
Thats the kind of story
That I want to write with you too
We can make it like they used to
We can make it like they used to

My daddy, he worked two jobs
To make sure us four kids, had what we needed
And mama she taught us all
That God provided for those who believe
No we did not have much, but they made sure
We were always together
And even when times were tough
They taught us that family is forever

They don't make'em like they used to
You don't hear stories like that, these days
They don't make'em like they used to
The kind of love that last, always
Thats the kind of story
That I want to write with you too
We can make it like they used to
We can make it like they used to

We are writing our story line by line
The good and bad times
And I pray we never stop
Until the last chapter is closed on this life
And when our grandchildren
Pull our memory off of the shelf
I hope they see, we fought for things that mattered
And we loved till our last breath
May they say

They don't make'em like they used to
You don't hear stories like that, these days
They don't make'em like they used to
The kind of love that last, always
Thats the kind of story
That I want to write with you too
We can make it like they used to
We can make it like they used to
We can make it like they used to
We will make it like they used to"
