"1" "Praise The Father, Praise The Son
Chris Tomlin

O sov'reign god, o matchless king-
The saints adore, the angels sing
And fall before the throne on grace
To you belongs the highest praise.

These sufferings, this passing tide
Under your wings I will abide,
And every enemy shall flee;
You are my hope and victory.

Praise the father, praise the son.
Praise the spirit, three in one.
Clothed in power and in grace
The name above all other names.

To the valley, for my soul;
Thy great descent has made me whole!
You word my heart has welcomed home;
Now peace like water ever flows.

Praise the father, praise the son.
Praise the spirit, three in one.
Clothed in power and in grace
The name above all other names.

Praise the father, praise the son.
Praise the spirit, three in one.
Clothed in power and in grace
The name above all other names.

Yours is the kingdom,
Yours is the power.
Your is the glory forever.
Yours is the kingdom,
Yours is the power.
Your is the glory forever.

Praise the father, praise the son.
Praise the spirit, three in one.
Clothed in power and in grace
The name above all other names.
The name above all other names."
