"1" "I Will Hold On
Vineyard

My times are in Your hands
I know I'll never understand
But I'll trust in You
Sometimes my heart grows cold
Im sorry when I take control
How I'm needing You

Even when I fall
You help me stand
Even when I'm lost
You take my hand

I will hold on
I will hold on
I will hold on
Yes, I will trust in You

My life is in Your hands
You hold the key to who I am
And I'll trust in You
Sometimes my heart is stone
Im sorry when I walk alone
How I'm needing You"
