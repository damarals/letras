"1" "Your Love Never Fails
Jesus Culture

Nothing can separate
Even if I run away
Your love never fails
I know I still make mistakes,
but You have new mercy for me everyday
Your love never fails

Chorus:
You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning
And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that you love me
And your love never fails

The wind is strong and the water's deep, but
I'm not alone here in these open seas
Cause your love never fails
The chasm was far too wide
I never thought I'd reach the other side
But your love never fails

You make all things, work together for my good"
