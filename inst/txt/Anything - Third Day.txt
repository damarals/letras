Third Day

I canâ€™t do anything
I canâ€™t do anything without You
But You can do everything
You can do everything You want
I just canâ€™t believe
I canâ€™t believe that You would love me
After everything
After everything Iâ€™ve done
And I want to love You
Love You more than life itself
And I want to hold You
Even though You canâ€™t be held
Because Youâ€™re so much more
Than everything Iâ€™ve ever known
Anything, anything
Iâ€™d give anything
I would give anything to hold You
I want to live for You
For You alone I want to live
When I see Your face
I would do anything to know You
You gave everything
You gave all You have to give
Halle, hallelujah
Halle, hallelujah
