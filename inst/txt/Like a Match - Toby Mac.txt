Ohh, yeah yeah yeah

I keep hearing people say
I need to get away
We got that getaway
That takes 'em to a whole new place
Won't leave us empty
Won't leave us craving more
We've found that fulfillin' fire
That they've been looking for

If it's real, we've gotta show it
Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it

You and me, we've gotta love
Hold nothing back
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match
Burning for the world,
we're burning for the world
Burning for the world to see
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match

Ever tasted something sweet
Knock you off your feet
Or bumped a song all night long,
kept it on repeat
I call up all my friends
I've gotta let 'em in
I tell them
take a drink of this and never thirst again

If it's real, we've gotta show it
Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it

You and me, we've gotta love
Hold nothing back
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match
Burning for the world,
we're burning for the world
Burning for the world to see
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match

That's who we are, who we are
That's who we are, oh oh oh oh
That's who we are, who we are
That's who we are, oh oh oh oh

If it's real, we've gotta show it
Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it
If it's real, we've gotta show it
Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it

You and me, we've gotta love
Hold nothing back
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match
Burning for the world,
we're burning for the world
Burning for the world to see
You and me, we've gotta love
Strike it up, like a match"
