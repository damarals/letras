"1" "When I Think Of You
Michael W. Smith

When I think of You I see
You dancing, You're dancing
When I think of You I hear
You singing to me
When I think of You I see
You praying, You're praying
When I think of You I hear
You calling for me

Yahweh, Hallelujah, we sing
Yahweh, there is no one like You, Lord
Yahweh, Your banner for me
Your banner for me is love

There is no one like, there is no one like my Yahweh, my Yahweh (4x)

repeat all"
