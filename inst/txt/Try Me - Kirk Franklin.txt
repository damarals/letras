Everybody needs somebody who'll be there someone to wipe the tears and
make you smile. So if you need someone that will not judge you when you fall no
matter what youâ€™ve done my love will answer when you call.

Chorus
So after your hearts been torn in two and you just don't know what to do, after
the rain has come and gone and the sun still won't shine, after your friends
have walked away and youâ€™ve run out of words to say, after youâ€™ve tried
everything else, then try me, ooh yeah

Verse 2
Life can make you cry and hurt you deep inside, I promise you I know the
pain you feel. So if you let me love you I can take those clouds away. Iâ€™ll
fill your world with joy and all your wrong I will erase.

Verse 3
Even though you hurt me and sometimes forget my name. My love is unconditional
that means that it would never ever change.
