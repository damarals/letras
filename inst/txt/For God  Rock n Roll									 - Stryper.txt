For God & Rock n' Roll

I know you've got
The feeling in you
I know it's deep within your soul
There's not a thing
That you wouldn't do
To take the prize & reach the goal

Stand up and shout out
There's one way and it's all about

(Chorus)
The Rock, The Roll
Never let the devil claim your soul
Make it loud, take it slow
Raise your hands
For God & Rock n' Roll

Musics a gift given from above
It's reaches out and touches all
We're born to rock
Created for love
But we've got to answer to the call

Stand up and shout out
There's one way for us to get out

(Chorus)
The Rock, The Roll
Never let the devil claim your soul
Make it loud, take it slow
Raise your hands
For God & Rock n' Roll"
