"1" "The Only One
Jimmy Needham

Under every tree
On top of every hill
You have found me there
Begging for a thrill
Drinking from the vine
Eating from the tree
You swore on your life
Would be the death of me
?cause all of my lovers are found in my billfold
They rest on my mantel
I can?t get a handle on what satisfies to me

If you?re the bread then fill me up
If you?re the water fill my cup
?til lesser loves are washed out to sea
Why can?t i see, oh, you?re the only one who satisfies me

Well the news has spread
Men ain?t meant for bread
But for every word
Coming from your head
But my head and heart
Are very different things
One tells me to run
And one tells me to cling
?cause all of my gods they have at signs and hash tags
But i?m raisin? my white flag
?cause i?m needin? what you have to give me

I?ve drank water
From sewers and gutters
Too shameful to utter
But you?re not like the others

So, if you?re the bread then fill me up
If you?re the water fill my cup
?til lesser loves are washed out to sea
Why can?t i see, you?re the only one
You?re the only one
Father, spirit, son
Who satisfies me"
