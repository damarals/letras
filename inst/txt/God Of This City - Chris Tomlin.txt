"1" "God Of This City
Chris Tomlin

You're the God of this city
You're the King of these people
You're the Lord of this nation
You Are

You're the light in this darkness
You're the hope to the hopeless
You're the peace to the restless
You are

There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God

The Greater things have yet to come
And Great things are still to be done
In this city
Greater things have yet to come
And Great things are still to be done
In this city

You're the God of this city
You're the King of these people
You're the Lord of this nation
You Are

You're the light in this darkness
You're the hope to the hopeless
You're the peace to the restless
You are

There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God

The Greater things have yet to come
And Great things are still to be done
In this city
Greater things have yet to come
And Great things are still to be done
In this city
The Greater things have yet to come
And Great things are still to be done here

There is no one like our God
There is no one like you God

The Greater things have yet to come
And Great things are still to be done in this city

Greater things have yet to come
And Great things are still to be done

We believe!
We believe in you god

Greater things have yet to come
And Great things are still to be done in this city
The Greater things have yet to come
And Great things are still to be done here"
