Hillsong United

There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden
Where another died for me

There is another in the fire

All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way I won't bow to the things of this word
And I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
What power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body
And now that power lives in me

There was another in the fire

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us

There is no other name
But the name that is Jesus
We who was and still is
And be through it all
So come what my in the space between
All the things unseen and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good you've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where you'll be

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us

Even if he doesn't
I will praise Him
Even if he doesn't
I'll stand tall

Even if he doesn't
(I'm not bowing to this world)
Even if he doesn't
(I ain't changing my confession or my Belief or who I believe in)
Even if he doesn't
(Oh I'm gonna sing louder then ever)
Even if he doesn't
(I'm stand longer then ever)

I can see the light

I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us

There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good you've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where you'll be

I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where you'll be"
