MÃºsicas Gospel

It can cross any mountain,
And it doesn't need any trail.
It's stong and it's tough.
That's why the Devil's in hell.

There's nothing it can't do,
And no place it can't reach.
Faith is something you feel,
And not something you teach.

Faith is not something
That you go out and buy.
But you'll sure want it
When it's time to die.

God created faith,
And will send it to you.
When you let him know
Your feelings are true.

There's nothing it can't do,
And no place it can't reach.
Faith is something you feel,
And not something you teach."
