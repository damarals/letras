"1" "Psalm
Chris Tomlin

Enter in through the gates
Enter in here and praise
Come before him, come bring your song
We are his people, he is our God

For the lord is good and his love endures
His love endures
For the lord is good and his love endures
His love endures forevermore
His faithfulness, it has no end
For the lord is good and his love endures
His love endures

Enter into his courts
Enter in with grateful hearts
Come before him, come bring your song
We are his people, he is our God

For the lord is good and his love endures
His love endures
For the lord is good and his love endures
His love endures forevermore
His faithfulness, it has no end
For the lord is good and his love endures
His love endures

Raise your voice
Shout for joy all the earth
We sing a new song now
We sing a new song now
It's your love
His love endures
His love endures forevermore
His faithfulness, it has no end
For the lord is good and his love endures
His love endures"
