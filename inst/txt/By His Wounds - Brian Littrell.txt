"1" "By His Wounds
Brian Littrell

He was pierced for our transgretions
He was crushed for our sins
The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him
And by His wounds
By His wounds we are healed

He was pierced for our transgretions
He was crushed for our sins
The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him
And by His wounds

By His wounds we are healed
We are healed by Your sacrifice
And the life that You gave
We are healed for You paid the price
By Your grace we are saved
We are saved

He was pierced for our transgretions
He was crushed for our sins
The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him
And by His wounds

By His wounds we are healed
We are healed by Your sacrifice
And the life that You gave
We are healed for You paid the price
By Your grace we are saved
We are saved

He was pierced for our transgretions
He was crushed for our sins
The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him
And by His wounds
By His wounds we are healed
By His wounds

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of
Jesus"
