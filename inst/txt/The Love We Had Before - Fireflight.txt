"1" "The Love We Had Before
Fireflight

I burnt the bridge
That you were building
But I left here
Feeling guilty
That we couldn't see
Eye to eye
Why can't we compromise?
Why are we choosing sides?
When will we realize?

We don't have
To fight anymore
Where is the love
We had before?
Wouldn't the world
Be better
Off if we decide?
We don't need
Our pride anymore
Where is the love
We had before?
Where is the love
Where is the love
Where is the love
The love we had before

You used to be
The one I'd run to
But now I tend to run you
Right into the ground
Sorry I was such a fool
Never saw your point of view
Can we start over somehow?

Yu know
We only hurt ourselves
When we don't communicate
Why can't we stop
And make a change?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?"
