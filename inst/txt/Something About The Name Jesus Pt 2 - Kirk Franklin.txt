"1" "Something About The Name Jesus Pt. 2
Kirk Franklin

Gather 'round and let me tell you 'bout Jesus
See this world, they don't know nothing 'bout Jesus
You can try but there's nobody like Jesus
Son of man, Son of God, Jesus

Springtime, summer or fall
Wherever you are, you can just call
The sweetest name that will never change is
Jesus, Jesus

In the world, things have changed
Look around, all I see is pain
And through it all one thing's the same
I still believe the power of Your name

I was sick deep in my soul
I needed someone to make me whole
I let Jesus take control
You see, I'm not crazy and I want you all to know

Gather 'round and let me tell you 'bout Jesus
See this world, they don't know nothing 'bout Jesus
You can try but there's nobody like Jesus
Son of man, Son of God, Jesus

Springtime, summer or fall
Wherever you are, you can just call
The sweetest name that will never change is
Jesus, Jesus

You've given up and walked away
God's not real, some people say
But when troubles come and the sky is gray
Everybody gets real beat now and wants to pray

But why wait 'til your money's gone?
Lose your house, job and you're all alone
Call His name and it won't be long
'Til you feel that fire vanish, shot up in your bones

And this is what we hear
Through the dark and through our fears
And even though the world may change
It is still the sweetest name

Gather 'round and let me tell you 'bout Jesus
See this world, they don't know nothing 'bout Jesus
You can try but there's nobody like Jesus
Son of man, Son of God, Jesus

Springtime, summer or fall
Wherever you are, you can just call
The sweetest name that will never change is
It is the love between Him and I

Jesus
(Jesus)
The wounded lamb
(Jesus)
The angel of day
(Jesus)
He's the great I Am

(Jesus)
Born a Galilaen
(Jesus)
My personal cornerstone
(Jesus)
Gone in the flesh, now seated upon His throne

(Ain't nobody like)
To home and shalom
(Jesus)
He is my peace
(Jesus)
To hold the child
(Jesus)
'Cause He's provided for me
(Jesus)

When I'm in trouble
(Jesus)
'Bout to lose my mind
(Jesus)
I call on Jesus
And He steps in on time

(Ain't nobody like)
There is a name that I love to hear
(Jesus)
Soothes my doubts
(Jesus)
Calm my fear
(Jesus)

Jesus
(Jesus)
My Sovereign King
(Jesus)
My Sovereign Lord
And sing

Gather 'round and let me tell you 'bout Jesus
See this world, they don't know nothing 'bout Jesus
You can try but there's nobody like Jesus"
