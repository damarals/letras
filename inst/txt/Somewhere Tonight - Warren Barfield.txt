"1" "Somewhere Tonight
Warren Barfield

Tears are falling

From someone's eyes

Hearts are breaking, yeah

Somewhere tonight

So many people are hurting

And can't see past their pain

But there's still healing in Jesus name



Tears are falling

As someone cries

Hearts are breaking

Somewhere tonight

So alone

Seems like no one cares

But this promise was made to you, Jesus will always be there



CHORUS:

So hold on to Jesus

With all your might

And you will find hope in Him

Somewhere tonight



Tears are falling

From someone's eyes

Hearts are breaking, yeah

Somewhere tonight

Life is a vapor

It's here and then it's gone

But our hope rests in this truth this world is not our home



CHORUS:

So hold on to Jesus

With all your might

And you, you will find hope in Him

Somewhere tonight



Somewhere

Hold on

Somewhere

Tears are being wiped away

From someone's eyes

And hearts are being mended

Somewhere tonight"
