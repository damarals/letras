"1" "Mamma Didn't Raise no Fool
Jimmy Needham

Mamma didn't raise no fool
I can see right through you
Daddy didn't do half bad too
So whatcha gonna do
Cause mamma mamma
Mamma didn't raise no fool

You're just like quicksand
I took a step and I was sinkin' in
God pulled me out
And now I'm onto your plan
I'm not afraid anymore

You're like a bad date
You keep on calling like it went great
That might of worked on me in 8th grade
But I'm not a kid anymore
So try it again, I'll be like
Mamma didn't raise no fool
I can see right through you
Daddy didn't do half bad too
So whatcha gonna do
Cause mamma mamma
Mamma didn't raise no fool

I got my eyes wide
I got a crew that's riding by my side
I got a truth that's changed my whole life
So I think you're luck has run out

Oh I can see him
I can see him on the mountain
Oh I can feel it
I can feel it help is comin'
Oh I can see him
I can see him on the mountain
I can see him so"
