"1" "Something New
Fireflight

He walks into
A crowded room
Smiles at everyone he sees
Another night
Pretending hes alright
Cant find what he really needs
Hes looking for

Something more
Something new
To heal his broken heart
Hes looking for
Someone who
Who can understand

She sees him there
Tries not to stare
But something stirs her deep inside
Shell recognize
Something in his eyes
Fight the urge to run and hide
And all the while
Shes looking for

They thought that they were lost,
But theyve been on their way
To the place where love would find them
Its time to let go of all the pain theyve known
and leave the past behind them
What is it that has brought them here
With faith it can become so clear"
