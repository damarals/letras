"1" "David And Goliath
Take 6

David was a young blood,
David was a stripling
But he looked like the jungle boy
That was talked about by Kipling
Well, he looked like a jungle boy
And he sang like a bird!

(But he fought like the devil when his temper got stirred)
When David was attending sheep for his pa
Somebody hollered, I think it was his ma
She said “Hurry to the field with this little-bitty sack,
I want you to take it to your brothers, but hurry right back”

Now David took his lunch box, and off he hurried
And there he saw the Israelites looking right worried
When he asked them what the problem was, they pointed to the prairie
There he saw a sight to make an elephant SCARY!!!

Oh, there he saw Goliath,
Champion of Gath,
He roared in his anger, howled in his wrath, Oh, he was stronger than a lion,
He was taller than a tree
Little David had to tiptoe
Just to reach up to his knee! “COME ON!”

Said the giant, raging and striding
“Bring out your strongmen from where y’ got ‘em hiding,
Drag out your champions from under the bunks
I’ll feed ‘em to the buzzards, the lizards and the skunks”

Now David heard him bragging, and said, “I declare
That giant’s got an awful lot of mouth up there”
So he strolled to the brook, and he picked up a pebble
It was smooth as ice, but hard as a devil!

He starts out for the giant,
Dancing on his toes
He was whirling away with his slingshot
He was singing a song like so… goes:
“ROCK OF AGES, cleft for me” – like so

The giant looks at David and lets out a laugh (Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!)
He laughs like a tiger being sassed by a cat
He laughs like a hyena, grins from ear to ear
Ba-ba-ba-Bangin’ on his armor with his ten-foot spear

He starts (starts) out of David, bangin’ and a-clankin’, He said:
“Come here, Junior! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! I’m gonna give you a spankin’!”

David took his slingshot, and he swung it ‘round his head
Out flew that pebble and the giant dropped
BOOOOOOOOM! (He dropped dead)
Dead! You know little David made a…
GOOD SHOT!"
