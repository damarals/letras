"1" "Light In a Darkened World
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

In these days, dark and lawless days
Shines a light we can see
Like the dawn of another day
That will soon come to be

Shining through the darkness
Ours is a message so bright
It offers hope and light
Sparkling like the daylight
Bringing tomorrow in sight
So ends the night

Those who sleep need awakening
As the time ebbs away
We give hope and encouragement
For their future we'll pray

Shining through the darkness
Ours is a message so bright
It offers hope and light
Sparkling like the daylight
Bringing tomorrow in sight
So ends the night"
