"1" "Water To Wine
Hillsong United

Everlasting
So infinite in wildest love
My soul thirsts for the things above
Turn this water into wine

Blood and water
The mercy flowing from your side
A river made of endless light
When my heart was running dry

So I'll stay
Stay in your love
As long as life within me I'll remain
In who you are lord

Take this wineskin
My spirit bursts for something new
There's nothing I want more than you
'cause only you can satisfy

So I'll stay
I'll stay in your love
As long as life within me I'll remain
In who you are lord

So I'll stay
Stay in your love
In the vintage of your heart
Lord only you could satisfy me

So I'll stay
Fixed within your life
A branch within your vine
Apart from you lord I've got nothing

So I'll stay
I will stay within your hold
I know you'll never let me go
And my soul it runs with mercy

So I'll stay
Stay in your love
I'll stay where you are
As long as life remains

So I'll stay
Stay with you
I'll never walk away
I'll never be the same
Turn this water into wine

I know you love me lord
I know you love me lord
I know you love me lord
I know you love me lord
Let your spirit transform my soul
Your spirit awakens me
Your spirit sets me free
And for all I'm yet to know
I know you'll never let me go
I know you love me
I know you love me so
I know what love means
It's who you are"
