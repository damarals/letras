"x"
"1" "Stand
Britt Nicole

I wake up to another day
I don't know if I can face
All the fears that are staring me down
Yeah, I'm trying to be brave
But I'm a thread about to fray
I want to stand, but I don't know how

I look up
And all I see is Your love holding me

When feel like giving up
When my heart has hurt too much
Feels like I've reached the end
No, I won't turn and run
This battle will be won
When I've done all I can
I stand, stand, stand
I stand, stand, stand

Some days I lose my place
It's a fight to keep my faith
But You are with me
I am not alone, no
When all around my world gives way
Tossed like an ocean wave
You are my rock when the storm clouds blow

On Your promise, I will stand
All other ground is sinking sand
On Your promise, I will stand
All other ground is sinking sand
Sinking sand"
