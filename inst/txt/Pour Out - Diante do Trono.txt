"1" "Pour Out
Diante do Trono

I wanna pour out my all to you
I empty myself of all my religious ways
I wanna pour out my all to you
I leave behind my need for recognition
And everything that keeps me from you, jesus
I wanna pour out my all to you
I wanna let go of my disappointment
I wanna pour out my all to you
To be released from the prison of the past
And everything that keeps me from you, jesus

Where can I go, oh lord?
For only you have the words of eternal life
Where can I hide, oh lord?
You are the air that I breathe
Your presence captured my heart

Flood me with your love
Transform me with you love
Draw my heart to you, oh lord
Move me with your love
And use me for your praise alone
Teach me how to hear your heart, oh god
I pour out my heart to you, lord
So take me in your arms of love"
