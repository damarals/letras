Hillsong United

VERSE 1
Say his name within the darkest hour
And see his light illuminate our path
The road is narrow but our gaze is set
On the love of Christ 'til the very end

VERSE 2
We walk in the truth that overcame our sin
Leaving our past and how we once had life
Giving our lives to see
Your Name made Known
'Cause the love of Christ is what the world needs most

PRE-CHORUS
So Lord
Lead us in the ways of Your Love
To lead our broken world to Your cross
Lead us in the ways of Your Love

CHORUS
We are Yours forever
Our lives won't be the same
Yours forever our eyes won't turn away
Yours forever!

VERSE 3
We sing Your praises 'til our lungs give out
To the hope of the world
The One who gave us life
Giving our lives to see
Your Name made known
'Cause the love of Christ is what the world needs most

CHORUS 2
We are Yours forever
Our lives won't be the same
Yours forever our eyes won't turn away
Yours forever our lives won't be the same
Yours forever our eyes won't turn away

BRIDGE
We're living in the One who gave
His life to see our sin erased
We know
We know
Our hope is never gonna fade away"
