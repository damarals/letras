Skillet

I can't
Recognize me anymore
(This is all too hard to say)
I am
I'm becoming sick and sore
(Why do I push you away?)

Just like I did before
Keep falling down when I try to soar
It's like I like the pain
I don't wanna feel this way

What's happening to me?

I, I'm slowly getting numb
I hate what I've become
Am I lost forever?
Bring me back to life
Help, my body's getting cold
So far away from home
But you feel like heaven
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

You can
You can make me real again
(Just a plastic mannequin)
I am
I am nothing but pretend
(But you know what I am)

Watch out 'cause this may sting (may sting)
Keep making promises I can't keep (can't keep)
Help me to break these chains (these chains)
I don't wanna feel this way

What's happening to me?

I, I'm slowly getting numb
I hate what I've become
Am I lost forever?
Bring me back to life
Help, my body's getting cold
So far away from home
But you feel like heaven
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

I'm digging in the dirt
This is hell on earth
Can you heal the places that I hurt
Can't open up my eyes
All I see is night
Bring me back to life

What's happening to me?

I, I'm slowly getting numb
I hate what I've become
Am I lost forever?
Bring me back to life
Help, my body's getting cold
So far away from home
But you feel like heaven
Bring me back to life

I, I'm slowly getting numb
I hate what I've become
Am I lost forever?
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

Bring me back to life"
