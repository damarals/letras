Hillsong United

I lay my life down at your feet
Cause you're the only one I need
I turn to you and you were always there
In troubled times it's you I seek
I put you first thats all I need
I humble all I am all to you!

Chorus
One way jesus, you're the only one that I could live for
One way jesus, you're the only one that I could live for

You are always, always there
Every how and everywhere
Your grace abounds so deeply within me
You will never ever change, yesterday today the same
Forever 'til forever meets no end

Chorus
One way jesus, you're the only one that I could live for
One way jesus, you're the only one that I could live for

Brigde
You are the way the truth and the life
We live by faith and not by sight for you
We're living all for you!"
