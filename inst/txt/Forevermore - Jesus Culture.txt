Jesus Culture

Hope, hope is alive in me
For all the world to see
That You are good
Love, love changes everything
Your love has rescued me
Now I am Yours

You took hold of my life
Now all of my love is Yours

All that I have is Yours
My soul will praise
Forevermore, forevermore
I come alive in You
My soul will shout
Forevermore, forevermore

Joy, it is my joy to sing
To bring You an offering
For You are good
And grace, Your grace is covering me
Save me and set me free
Now I am Yours

You took hold of my life
Now all of my love is Yours

All that I have is Yours
My soul will praise
Forevermore, forevermore
I come alive in You
My soul will shout
Forevermore, forevermore

Forevermore, forever I am Yours

We are dancing, we are singing, we are coming alive
We are dancing, we are shouting, come set our hearts on fire"
