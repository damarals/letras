"1" "Oh The Power
Kari Jobe

Knees to the earth that You breathed by Your word
As You watched the darkness come
Crushed by the weight of the cost as You prayed
Not my will but Yours be done
Gethsemane, where heaven met me

Redeemer, crowned in endless praise
My Savior, name above all names
King Jesus, take the highest place

There on the hill You surrendered Your will
For they know not what they do
Grief in Your heart, Your hands bear the scars
Of a love that led You to the tomb
Calvary, where heaven met me

Redeemer, crowned in endless praise
My Savior, name above all names
King Jesus, take the highest place

Oh the power of the cross
Oh the power of Your blood
Oh the power of the cross
Oh the power of Your blood

Oh the power of the cross
Oh the power of Your blood

Oh darkness, You have lost Your strength
O hell, you lost ev'rything
King Jesus, take the highest place

Redeemer, crowned in endless praise
My Savior, name above all names
King Jesus, take the highest place"
