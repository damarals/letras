Hillsong United

I will give thanks unto you, lord
For you are good your loving kindness never ends
I raise my hands, you heal my soul
Here in the presence of the lord my hearts restored
And you guide me in the paths of righteousness
And you hide me in the shadow of your hand
I rest in you

Blessed be the name of the lord
I'm my father's child forevermore
You heard every cry
You broke every chain
You alone delivered me
The son of God he reigns on the throne
King of kings let all the nations know
That the lord is good and his mercy endures forever

My prince of peace, you lifted me
Where everything that's named is placed under your feet
And may my praises be as incense to you, lord
And may my worship be a sweet fragrance
To you alone my king
For the lord is good and
His mercy endures forever and ever"
