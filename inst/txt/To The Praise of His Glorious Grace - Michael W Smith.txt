"1" "(To The Praise of His) Glorious Grace
Michael W. Smith

Words & Music: Deborah D. Smith and Michael W. Smith

Let us praise the One who chose us
Let us thank the One who knows us
Set apart, blameless in His sight
Through the Son, we have faith, we have life
To the praise of His glorious grace
Chorus:
May the God of our Lord the Almighty Father
Give you wisdom and peace, His comforting Spirit
That you may know His hope
You may know His riches
And you may know His mighty strength
To the praise of His glorious grace
To the praise of His glorious grace

Grace and peace to you through Jesus
Our Deliverer receives us
Our hearts created for His Word
Our salvation was spoken and we heard
To the praise of his glorious grace

Chorus
