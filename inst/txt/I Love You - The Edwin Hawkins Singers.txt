"1" "I Love You
The Edwin Hawkins Singers

Verse 1:
I love You, I love You,
I love You, Lord, today;
because You cared for me
in such a special way.

That's why I praise You,
I lift You up,
and I magnify Your name;
that's why my heart is filled with praise.

Verse 2:
My heart, my mind,
my soul belongs to You.
You paid the price for me
way back on Calvary.

That's why I praise You,
I lift You up,
and I magnify Your name;
that's why my heart is filled with praise."
