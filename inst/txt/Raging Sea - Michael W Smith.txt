"x"
"1" "Raging Sea
Michael W. Smith

Sometimes the journey makes you weary
Feels like a long winding road
Sometimes this life can lose its meaning
But you might be surprised to find some hope

Maybe you're wondering where love is
You may feel it's far away from here
Maybe you're wondering where I am
But you might be surprised to find I'm near

~*~*~Chrous~*~*~
And when your life is tossed and turning
And you are on the raging sea
I'll come and pull you from the water
Then you will know that you are free

So if you're stumbling through the valley
Or if you're tempted to give up the fight
Reach out your hand and I will lead you
I'll be your strong arm in the night

Chorus-2 times

I'll come and pull you from the water
Then you will know that you are free"
