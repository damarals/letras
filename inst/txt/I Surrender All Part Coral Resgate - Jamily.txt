"1" "I Surrender All (Part. Coral Resgate)
Jamily

All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
In His presence daily live

All to Jesus I surrender
Humbly at His feet I bow
Worldly pleasures all forsaken
Take me, Jesus, take me now

[Chorus]
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee, my blessed Savior
I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender
Make me Savior wholly thine
May Thy Holy Spirit fill me
May I Know Thy power divine

[Chorus]
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee, my blessed Savior
I surrender all (3x)."
