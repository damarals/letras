"1" "I Adore
Hillsong United

The universe is at Your feet
Gives You praise evermore
The stars will light the sky for you
And always, God be praised

And we sing the Lord is on high
The Lord is on hight

I adore You, I adore You
And there's none that compares
To your majesty O Lord
I adore You, I adore You

And I stand in the wonder of Your love

We will crown Him King forever
Living Saviour, Jesus Redeemer

Lord of Heaven robed in majesty
Crowned in glory, creation adores You

Holy, Holy God Almighty
And forever the Lord is exalted

Hear the angels shout His anthem
Ever-living God we adore You"
