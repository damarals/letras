"1" "Take All Of Me
Hillsong United

You broke the night like the sun
And healed my heart with your great love
Any trouble I couldn't bear
You lifted me upon your shoulders

Love that's stronger
Love that cover sin
And takes the weight of the world

I love You
All of my hope is in You
Jesus Christ take my life
Take all of me

You stand on mountaintops with me
With You I walk through the valleys
You gave your only Son for me
Your grace is all I rely on

I love You so, and I give up my heart to say
I need you so, my everything"
