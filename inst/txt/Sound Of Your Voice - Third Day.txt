"1" "Sound Of Your Voice
Third Day

I ran away from your love
But you waited for me
Yes, you waited for me
And then I heard your song
Singing over me
Singing over me

Now that I hear you, Lord
I want to know you more
I want to know you more

Sing your song to me
Oh, there’s no greater thing
Than to listen to the sound of your voice
When I hear your song
I want to sing along
And listen to the sound of your voice
The sound of your voice

Lord, I am calling your name
And I’m waiting for you
Yes, I’m waiting for you
So won’t you show me your way
And I will follow you
Yes, I will follow you

Singing over me
Bringing peace and mercy
With a song that never ends
Singing over me
Marvelous and holy
Lord, I want to hear your song again"
