Vineyard

Here i am again searching for a place
Where your grace can show me rest
Will you lead me there with your tenderness
With your promise to protect

When i fall you lift me up
When iâ€™m lost you are the way

You are my shelter when strength is gone
You are my refuge when pain holds on
And my soul finds rest in you, oh god

Here i am again leaning on your strength
Leaning on your faithfulness
You keep me sheltered here in your warm embrace
A place to rest my head again"
