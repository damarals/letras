"1" "Child in the Manger
Michael W. Smith

Child in the manger
Infant of Mary
Outcast and stranger, Lord of all
Child who inherits
All our transgressions
All our demerits on Him fall

Once the most holy
Child of salvation
Gently and lowly
Now as our glorious Mighty Redeemer
See Him victorious
O'er each foe

Prophets foretold Him
Infant of wonder
Angels behold Him on His throne
Worthy our Saviour
Of all our praises
Happy forever are His own
