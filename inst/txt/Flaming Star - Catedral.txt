Catedral

Every man has a flaming star
A flaming star,over his shoulder
And when a man sees his flaming star
He knows his time,his time has come
Flaming star,don't shine away,flaming star
Flaming star,keep behind me,flaming star
This lovely that I gotta do
Give time to make all this dreams come true,flaming star
When I ride,I feel that flaming star
That flaming star,over my shoulder
And so I ride,caught on that flaming star
That I look around,I never looked around
Flaming star,don't shine away,flaming star
Flaming star,keep behind me,flaming star
This lovely that I gotta do
Give time to make all this dreams come true,flaming star
One fine day,I see that flaming star
That flaming star,over my shoulder
And when I see,flaming star
I know my time,my time has come."
