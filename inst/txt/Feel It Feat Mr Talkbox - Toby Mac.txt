"1" "Feel It (Feat. Mr. Talkbox)
Toby Mac

When I sit back and imagine
Life without you, I can't fathom
How I ever thought I'd make it on my own
And there's at least a million reasons
I'm still standing here believin'
You're my comfort, you're my healin'
This I know (this I know)

Well, you can't see the wind
But it moves the leaves
From the bottom to the top
Of the tallest trees
You are everything I will ever need
And they can't take that from me

Oh, I feel it in my heart
I feel it in my soul
That's how I know
You take our brokenness
And make us beautiful
Yeah, that's how I know

Everybody talkin' like they need some proof
But what more do I need than to feel you

Love came crashin' in
Never gonna be the same again
Yeah, you came crashing in
You wrecked me, you wrecked me

Love came crashin' in
Never gonna be the same again
Yeah, you came crashing in
You wrecked me
