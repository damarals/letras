"1" "How I Love You Lord
Vineyard

More and more each day
In each and every way
How I love You, Lord
Calling out Your name
Calling out Your praise
How I love You, Lord

I need You more and more
I need You Lord

Chorus:
How I love You, Lord
How I love You, Lord
How I love You, how I love You, Jesus

You wipe away my sin
You cleanse me from within
How I love You, Lord
You carry all my pain
You make me whole again
How I love You, Lord"
