"1" "We Give You Glory
Jeremy Camp

We have raised a thousand voices
Just to lift Your holy name
And we will raise thousands more to sing
Of Your beauty in this place

None can even fathom
No not one define Your worth
As we marvel in Your presence
To the ends of the earth

We give You glory
Lifting up our hands and singing Holy
You alone are worthy
We just want to touch Your heart Lord
Touch You heart

Glory
Lifting up our voice and singing Holy
You alone are worthy
We just want to touch Your heart Lord
Touch You heart

As we fall down before You
With our willing hearts we seek
In the greatness of Your glory
It's so hard to even speak

There is nothing we can offer
No nothing can repay
So we give You all our praises
And lift our voice to sing

Bridge:
Our hope is drenched in You
Our faith has been renewed
We trust in Your every word
Nothing else can even measure up to You"
