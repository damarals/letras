"x"
"1" "Freedom
Dominic Balli

I remember when
Used to play my minds
Like a play this guitar
When I think of being
Used to own my minds
Or when we come so far
Or when we come so far

Now that I left you
Now that I'll miss someone else than you
I found myself for refuge
From your story night

Freedom was all I was looking for
Freedom was all I was dreaming of
Oh, your freedom was all I was looking for
In this life you ain't never gonna be free to tell
Oh, reach out and grab it for yourself
Grab it for yourself
Grab it for yourself

I don't play the slave no more
I don't walk that way
I don't road that way
Because the son don't rose again
Paying freedom's prize
It cost the father his son
It cost the son his life

Now that I left you
Now that I'll miss someone else than you
I found myself for refuge
From your story night

Freedom was all I was looking for
Freedom was all I was dreaming of
Oh, your freedom was all I was looking for
In this life you ain't never gonna be free to tell
Oh, reach out and grab it for yourself
Grab it for yourself
Grab it for yourself"
