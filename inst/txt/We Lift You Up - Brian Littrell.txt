"1" "We Lift You Up
Brian Littrell

When I think of all the things that god has done for me
And how my faith has always conquered adversity
I stand amazed to think that god
Really knows who I am
And to think that within me
There is a master plan

And at night when I pray
To the lord that I know
I thank him for his precious blood
He gave to save my soul
And that's why

We lift you up
Higher than the heaven
We lift you up
('cause your love is) Deeper than the deepest sea
We lift you up
Higher than the mountains
We lift you up
He died for you and me

Let me share with you just how I know he's blessed my life
He opened up his precious hands
and gave me a wife
And then he touched her deep down in her soul
and gave me a son
For it is he that knows no greater love
For his the one

And at night when I pray
To the lord that I know
I thank him for his precious blood
He gave to save my soul
And that's why

We lift you up
(Higher) higher than the heaven
We lift you up
('cause your love is) deeper than the deepest sea
We lift you up
(Higher then) higher than the mountains
We lift you up
He died for you and me

Higher...

We lift you up
Higher than the heaven (than the heaven)
We lift you up
(because your love is) deeper than the deepest sea
We lift you up
Higher than the mountains
We lift you up
He died for you and me

Oh yeah

We lift you up
Higher than the heaven
We lift you up
Deeper than the deepest sea
We lift you up
Higher than the mountains, oh yeah
We lift you up
He died for you and me

We lift you up"
