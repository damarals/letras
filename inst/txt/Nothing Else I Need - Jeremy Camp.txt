"1" "Nothing Else I Need
Jeremy Camp

When I think of all I've seen
Nothing compares to what you give
And to drink of what you bring
You quench the thirst for me to live
I am satisfied by what tenderness you've shown to me
And I empty all that I am

Refrão:
And you fill my life
You're everything to me
And There's nothing else I need anymore
And I know you are everything to me
And there's nothing else I need anymore

I have tasted
And I know this fire birthed inside will only grow
And I've sought all that this world tried to offer me
And it lead me to your feet
And I empty all that I am

(Refrão)

I will lay down all my needs and you will come and make them new
To make you my only desire, my desire
And you fill my life
You're everything to me
You're everything to me, yeah

(Refrão)

There's nothing else I need..."
