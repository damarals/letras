"1" "Wings Of A Dove
MÃºsicas Gospel

When trouble surrounds us when evils come
The body grows weak the spirit grows numb
When these things beset us He doesn't forget us
He sends down His love on the wings of a dove

Chorus
On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove

When Noah had drifted on the flood many days
He searched for land in various ways
Trouble he had some but wasn't forgotten
He sent him His love on the wings of a dove
(chorus)

When Jesus went down to the water that day
He was baptized in the usual way
When it was done, God blessed his son
He sent him His love on the wings of a dove
(chorus)"
