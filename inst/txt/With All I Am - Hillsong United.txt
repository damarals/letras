"1" "With All I Am
Hillsong United

Into your hand, I commit again
With all I am, for you, Lord
You hold my world in the palm of your hand
And I am yours forever.

Jesus, I believe in you
Jesus, I belong to you
You're the reason that I live, the reason that I sing
With all I am.

I'll walk with you wherever you go
Through tears and joy
I'll trust in you
And I will live in all of your ways, your promises
Forever.

I will worship, I will worship you."
