I saw you walking by yourself
Your eyes were crying out for help
I know you feel your pain is more
Then anyone's been hurt before.

I know love hurts when it's over
If you wanna cry it's alright
You're like a fallen soldier
But you just can't lay down and die.

You've got to remember
You're not alone in this world
Always remember
You're not alone in this world.

The moment that I looked at you
I recognized the killing truth
You really think there's no way out
But if you let me, I can help you now.

Through all these shattered emotions
There's a lesson to learn
So come on let me hold you closer
Love can soothe what love has burned.

You've got to remember
You're not alone in this world
Always remember
You're not alone in this world.
You've got to remember
Never alone, never alone, never, never alone.

I got to tell you now baby
Through all these shattered emotions
There's a lesson to learn
So come on let me hold you closer
Love can soothe what love has burned.

You've got to remember
You're not alone in this world
Always remember
You're not alone in this world.

You've got to remember (got to remember)
You're not alone in this world
Always remember (got to remember)
You're not alone in this world.

You've got to remember (got to remember)
You're not alone in this world
Always remember (got to remember)
You're not alone in this world.
You've got to remember.
