"1" "I Am
P.O.D.

I am the murdered, the pervert, sick to the core
I am the unclean, dope fiend, I am the whore

I am the beat down, mistreated, sexually abused
I have violated, fornicated and sexually used
I am the con artist, cold hearted, smooth preacher
Cash stealer, emotion bleeder, the soul leacher
I feed off the poor but I'm a slave to the rich
I'm in depression so, this reflection is making me sick

Are you the one that's come to set me free?
Cause if you knew who I am
would you really want to die for me?
They say you are the cursed man,
The one who hangs from this tree
I know this is the one and only son of god
But tell who the fuck is he!
So tell me!

I am fake, a fraud, a phony, I'm known liar
Anorexic, rejected object of your desire
Suicidal thoughts, keep one in the chamber
I'm a turned out streetwalking heroin banger
I am a secret cutter, porn lover, the town, drunkard
Next door, neighborhood slut, I am somebody's mother
Outcasted arrogant basterd son
I am the talk of the town but this story's just begun

I am what you reaped, I am what you sewed
I am that guy talking to himself, I am alone
I'm the forgotten child ravaged and raped through sex traffic
And since I'm a little strange, my daddy called me a faggot
I am insecure, immature, even I discuss me
In denial, pill pop'n, prescription junkie

I see demons, eyes bleeding, my soul impure
Already know that I'm the disease, but tell me what's the cure?
This is me, we are him and I am you
Old things passed away and all becomes new!"
