"1" "See What We Become
Dominic Balli

Stolen from our country
Taken far from home
(They) lock us in a bottle
See what we become
Worthless efforts falling
Can’t undo what’s done
Lock us in a bottle
See what we become
Take a look around and see what we become
Moving forward as we the light becomes our sun

Woah Oh

Carried off like orphans
Will we hold or flee
Find us in the fire
Like Jonah in the sea
Falling far from freedom
When love has come and gone
Find us in the fire
See what we become

Take a look around and see what we become
Moving forward as the light becomes our sun
All we are is all we got when we get home
Moving forward as the light becomes our sun

See what we become
In the darkest of our hour
Will we stand up fight or run
When the darkness overshadows"
