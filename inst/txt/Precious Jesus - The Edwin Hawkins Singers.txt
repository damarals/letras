"1" "Precious Jesus
The Edwin Hawkins Singers

Verse:
Precious Jesus, how I love You,
how I lift high my voice with Your praise.
Holy Spirit, I implore Thee,
drench my heart as my lips part Your grace.

Chorus:
I am persuaded, Lord, to love You,
I have been changed to bless Your name.
I am constrained by this great gospel,
forever to worship Thee.

Ending:
Forever to worship Thee.
(repeat as desired)"
