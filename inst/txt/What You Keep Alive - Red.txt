"1" "What You Keep Alive
Red

You should be afraid of me
Pain is the promise I will keep
I am the whisper in the dark
I am the scream when you fall

And you will feel the pain, you'll see
And I will bring the pain you need

You keep me alive
(So I can hurt you)
You need me inside
(I'm what you keep alive)

You picked me up, you watched me shine
Like a razor in your hand
And when I cut beneath your skin
You want it all again
I am the call in the night
I am the truth behind your lie

And now you'll feel the pain, you'll see

You keep me alive
(So I can hurt you)
You need me inside
(I'm what you keep alive)

Turning, the knife is turning now

I can't pay this ransom
(My love, my enemy)
Does any hope remain
(I'm swimming in your veins)
My love, my enemy
(Now you can't escape)
I can feel you in my veins
(The pain is on its way)
And now it's too late
(Now I'm letting go)
You should've run away
(I'll watch you suffocate)
Now you can't escape
I am the dark and I am awake

(Suffocate)

Waking, the nightmare bleeds, over
I'll fight you, your darkness, feeding

I keep you alive
(So I can hurt you)
I lift the knife
(I'm what you keep alive)
Now you can't escape
(Suffocate, suffocate)
You will feel the pain
(Suffocate, suffocate)"
