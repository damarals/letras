"x"
"1" "Come Home
Switchfoot

A spark in your eyes starts to let go
Turning to smoke
Everyone knows it
Something inside starts to let go
Turns into smoke
But nobody shows it

The hope that we had
The dream that we were
Both seem so far away
You were made for than just pain

I'm looking for reasons to try
A reason to live or to die
Won't you come home?
Back to where you started

If this is the meaning of life
Every breath that you take is a fight
Won't you come home?
Back to where your heart is
Won't you come home?

What once was a girl is now just a ghost
Is now just a ghost
And everyone knows it

Seen it before
And we watched her explode
Yeah a high and a low
But nobody shows it

Nothing hurts worse
Than a hope that's deferred
Don't let it slip away
See you shining under the shame

Looking for reasons to try
A reason to live or to die
Won't you come home?
Back to where your heart is

If this is the meaning of life
Every breath that you take is a fight
Won't you come home?
Back to where your heart is
Back to where your heart is
Slipping away
Slipping away

Yeeaaah
Ohhhhhh

Looking for reasons to try
Looking for reasons to try
A reason to live or to die
Won't you come home?
Back to where your heart is

If this is the meaning of life
Every breath that we take is a fight
Won't you come home?
Back to where your heart is

Won't you come home?
Won't you come home?"
