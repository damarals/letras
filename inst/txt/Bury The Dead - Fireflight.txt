Fireflight

Break the mirror but I'm still not alone
I keep hearing where it all went wrong
(And every day, I try to escape)
(Your voice in my brain, I hear you say)
Learn your lesson, you're just too naive
Count your blessings, stay down at my field
(And every day, I try to escape)
(There's only so much that I can take)

What if I can't forget the hurt?
What if I can't do it your way?
(How can I forgive if I can't forget?)
Didn't you know that this means war
Now that we're chained, I can't close the door
(How can I forgive if I can't forget?)

You're the cancer burning in my blood
Time to answer for the things you've done
(Get out of my head, enough has been said)
(I've got to move on and bury the dead)

What if I can't forget the hurt?
What if I can't do it your way?
(How can I forgive if I can't forget?)
Didn't you know that this means war
Now that we're chained, I can't close the door
(How can I forgive if I can't forget?)

Can I move on, can I bury the dead (if I can't forget)
Can I move on, if I bury the dead
Can I move on, can I bury the dead (if I can't forget)
Can I move on if I bury the dead
Can I move on, can I bury the dead
Can I move on if I bury the dead

I thought I was in control
Thought I knew how to let go
But I don't want to, do I want to?
I thought you were the disease
But the burden's still on me to forgive, to forgive
To bury the dead

What if I can't forget the hurt?
What if I can't do it your way?
(How can I forgive if I can't forget?)
Didn't you know that this means war
Now that we're chained, I can't close the door
(How can I forgive if I can't forget?)

What if I can't forget the hurt?
What if I can't do it your way?
(How can I forgive if I can't forget?)
Didn't you know that this means war
Now that we're chained, I can't close the door
(How can I forgive if I can't forget?)

Can I move on, can I bury the dead
Can I move on if I bury the dead"
