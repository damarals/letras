"1" "Everyone Knows
Delirious

Love grows stronger
When you give it away
I’m holding on to see the sunrise, your eyes

You have this wonder and it’s beautiful
It makes my face shine like the sunrise, your eyes
Time to realise

It was love that saved us and love will save again
Only love can save us and love will save again

Everyone knows that this fire grows
And I’m a, a man who knows where this fire glows

I love to hear you singing
Sweet redemption songs
Your face is brighter than the
Sunrise, your eyes, time to realise
It was love that saved us, and love will save again
Only love can save us, and love will save again"
