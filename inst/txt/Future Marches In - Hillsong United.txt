"1" "Future Marches In
Hillsong United

Don't close your eyes because the night is dark
Don't fear the future should it black the sun
There's a hope burning brighter in a fearless love
There's a brighter day
There's a higher name

Don't hide in silence while the truth screams out
Don't fear the future shaking up this ground
There's a freedom that marches in a different sound
So if you have the choice
If you have the voice
Then lift your voice and sing

If you have the breath
Lift up your voice and sing
If you have the heart
Lift up your voice and sing
If you have the faith
Lift up your voice and sing
If you have the love
Now's the time to use it

Look back no further than the saviour's cross
Look to the future like the grave is lost
There's a promise returning all the stolen years
There's nothing left to fear
Now the king is here
So lift your voice and sing

If you have the breath
Lift up your voice and sing
If you have the heart
Lift up your voice and sing
If you have the faith
Lift up your voice and sing
If you have the love
Now's the time to use it

Salvation runs for everyone
So open up the doors and let us sing

I hear the sound march in like thunder
I see the spirit bursting out in a mighty flood
Over everyone
I hear the sound of sons and daughters
I see the old dream wild in young imagining
Young and old will dream
I hear the sound of earth surrendered
Wonders above and signs below
For all to see
We have been set free
So open up the doors and sing

If you've been set free
Lift up your voice and sing
If you have the love
Now's the time to use it

Salvation runs for everyone
So open up the doors and let us sing

Open up the doors and let us sing
We've been redeemed, we've been set free
The time has come
The fight is won
The future marches in and calls us free

Open up the doors and let us sing
We've been redeemed, we've been set free
The time has come
The fight is won
The future marches in and calls us free

Lift up your voice and sing
Salvation runs for everyone
So open up the doors and let us sing
The time has come
The fight is won
The future marches in and calls us free"
