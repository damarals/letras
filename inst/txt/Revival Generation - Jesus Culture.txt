"1" "Revival Generation
Jesus Culture

I heard an old man talking of a time that was long ago he said
The fires been dormant for awhile but he was praying
And with this prayer my heart caught fire and now it won’t let go
Cause I found the reason why I’m alive

Were a new breed rising and we’re coming we’re gonna take a stand
There is a new passion burning in our hearts
A new love for jesus a new hope and a vision
For this revival here we are

Its revival time
We are a revival generation
Its revival time
We are a revival generation

Consecrated is who we are its who we’re called to be
We’d rather see revival than build these kingdoms of pride and greed
Fan into flame this revival fire let it burn
Crush your children until our hearts are inflamed

Its revival time
We are a revival generation
Its revival time
We are a revival generation

Its revival time
Its revival time
Its revival time
We are a revival generation"
