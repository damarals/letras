Hillsong United

From the cloud you speak
What was veiled now is seen
Jesus the image of
The invisible God

Divinity confirmed
In the transfigure word
That kingdom once conceived
On the earth now revealed

Holy is the Lord
Revealed before my eyes
And my burning heart
Can scarcely take it in
As I behold
Your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing
It's allelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King

Lead my longing heart
To the high ground to the clear view
And in awe I'll be there
Beholding You

Holy is the Lord
Revealed before my eyes
And my burning heart
Can scarcely take it in
As I behold
Your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing
It's allelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King

It's hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King

Now I know
I have seen
The glory that cannot be unseen
I am changed
Changing still
As I look upon the lord and pray

Holy is the Lord
Revealed before my eyes
And my burning heart
Can scarcely take it in
As I behold
Your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing
It's allelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King

It's hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah my King"
