"1" "Forever In Our Hearts
P.O.D.

Pain and suffering
Far beyond what all could comprehend
Has come to pass, and there’s no turning back

We cry for all we knew
And we try to make it through
The anguish seems impossible to bear

Shall we live forever standing by?
Or can we give a moment of our time?

Stand with me, your soul is free
And you’ll live forever in our hearts
Be at peace, forever free
And you’ll live forever in our hearts

We have to carry on
There will be another dawn
Just hold my hand, we’ll make it through this time

For everyone that’s gone
We must stand and all be strong
Together we can face this agony

Shall we live forever standing by?
Or can we give a moment of our time?

Stand with me, your soul is free
And you’ll live forever in our hearts
Be at peace, forever free
And you’ll live forever in our hearts

Now we’re calling out to keep the faith alive
And if we join as one you know hope will arrive
We can’t sit, we’ve got to rise and just reach out our hands
So won’t you stand?

Stand with me, your soul is free
And you’ll live forever in our hearts
Be at peace, forever free
And you’ll live forever in our hearts"
