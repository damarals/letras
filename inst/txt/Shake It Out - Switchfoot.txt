"1" "Shake It Out
Switchfoot

Sitting on the back porch, sipping lemonade
I got some satisfaction, I really got it made
The radio is humming, all of my favorite tunes
You know I’m feeling fine, a little red, red wine
So I just stop to croon
It’s alright

It’s alright if you wanna
Yeah, yeah
It’s alright if you’re gonna
Yeah, yeah
It’s alright if you need to
Yeah, yeah
It’s alright, you can be you
Yeah, yeah
You gotta shake it out
You know you gotta shake it out

Ohhh, ohhh
Me and my own lady
Went out the other night
We met some friends for dinner
Then danced away the night
Went on for a nightcap
And what comes naturally
And when the moment came and she called my name
I let her know it was me

It’s alright if you wanna
Yeah, yeah
It’s alright if you’re gonna
Yeah, yeah
It’s alright if you need to
Yeah, yeah
It’s alright, you can be you
Yeah, yeah
You gotta shake it out
You know you gotta shake it out

It’s alright,
Let me shake that thing
It’s alright,
Let me shake that thing

Go on and shake it real hard and don’t worry you’re not going to break it
Go on and shake it real hard and don’t worry you’re not going to break it"
