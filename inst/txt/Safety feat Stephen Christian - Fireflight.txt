"1" "Safety (feat. Stephen Christian)
Fireflight

All alone, alone you float
Can anybody see you you're a ghost
Do they know the pain you hide
Do they know the pain you hide
Cry for help, reaching out
Can anybody hear you when you shout
Are you hidden from their eyes
Are you hidden from their eyes
I see you

In the light, in the dark
I will be your bleeding heart
Cause when you need me
I'll be your safety
I'll be your safety
Like a fire, running wild
Can't contain what's deep inside
Ready to break free
I'll be your safety
I'll be your safety

House of cards, you fell apart
Feels like you were falling from the start
And now the walls are caving in
Now the walls are caving in
Take a breath, take may hand
It doesn't really matter where we land
I'll be there to help you stand
I'll be there to help you stand
I'll hold you

Your feet are gonna hit the ground
Hope is all you need right now
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there"
