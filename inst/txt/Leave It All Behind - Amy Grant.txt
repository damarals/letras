"x"
"1" "Leave It All Behind
Amy Grant

I took a drive along the west bank of the shore
I thought of what you said then I thought some more
You say your life is all but chiseled out in stone
And all you want is just a taste of the unknown

Think it was yesterday I called you on the phone
You say you need a change, I recognize the tone
Buy me a ticket please, to anywhere I'll go
I'm not saying what is right or what is wrong
I'm just thinking you've been hanging here too long

So, why don't we, just stop and leave it all behind
Maybe a change would ease your mind
For a time, leave it all behind

What I really want to do is see you smile
Hear you talk and let me listen for a while
There's too much going on to keep it all inside
You try to whisper, but you start to scream and shout
What you need is just a place to let it out

So, why don't we, just stop and leave it all behind
Maybe a change would ease your mind
For a time, leave it all behind
We will see if there's a place that we can go
Some place that no one else will know
How to find, leave it all behind

Uh uh uh uh uh uh

You try to whisper, but you start to scream and shout
What you need is just a place to let it out

So, why don't we, just up and leave it all behind
Maybe a change would ease your mind
For a time
We will see if there's a place that we can go
Some place that no one else will know
How to find, leave it all behind
