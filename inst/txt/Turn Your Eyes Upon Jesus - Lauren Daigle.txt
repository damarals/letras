"1" "Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus
Lauren Daigle

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in his wonderful face
And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of his glory and grace

Oh, soul, are you weary in troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Savior
And life more abundant and free

Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we following He there
Over us sin no more hath dominion
For more than conquerors we are!

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in his wonderful face
And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of his glory and grace

His word shall not fail you, He promised
Believe Him and all will be well
Then go to a world that is dying
His perfect salvation to tell

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in his wonderful face
And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of his glory and grace

Oh, turn your, oh turn your
Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus
Oh, turn your, oh turn your
Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus"
