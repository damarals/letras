"x"
"1" "Save Me
Michael W. Smith

Save me, oh God
for the waters
have come up to my neck
and I am sinking to the bottom where I cannot stand
I am calling to you
can you hear my cry?

oh my God! you've turned your eyes
and now my heart has come alive!

CHORUS
Only you have come to find me
Only you have come to pull me out
Only you have come to save me
Only you have come to wrap your arms around me

Save me, oh God.
I have wondered
and I cannot find your hand
and I am looking for you, Father, but my eyes fail
I am calling to you
can you hear my cry?

Oh my God! you've turned your eyes
and now my heart has come alive

CHORUS

BRIDGE
No one has ever loved me
like the way you loved me
wrap your arms around
(repeat)

CHORUS

No one (only you have come to find me) has ever loved me
like the way you loved me
(only you have come to pull me out)
wrap your arms around
No one (only you have come to save me) has ever loved me
like the wat you loved me
(wrap your arms around me)
wrap your arms around me

CHORUS"
