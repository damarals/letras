Lecrae

And for one second all my problems
Fade to gray like no one saw 'em
I get a God's eye view on everything
Lookin' out my window pane'
Wheels up with the seats back
Wheels up with the seats back (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Some days I can't believe how far we made it
I thank God for the fans and pray for patience
At twenty-thousand feet, we climbing straight up
Wheels up with the seats back
Wheels up with the seats

Okay, I was told a long time ago to let the drama go and go and find a goal
Running for the edge like Geronimo
Sky-high I fly, I v√°monos
All of that was a lifetime ago
Nowadays I just gotta make time to go
Take my Gs to Belize, now we all overseas, man, look at what God be on
Lord, God be on, guide me home
When I die, I reside where I belong
When I fly, I delight, the flight is long
Give me time, clear my mind to find my zone, yeah
Introvert at work, please do not disturb, I just need some time for me, uh
Isolate, then meditate, and pray and wait in hopes somebody'd pray for me
Paint these pictures and, bury my face in Scripture (Scripture)
Pray that my soul deliver
Fall to my knees, I know He hear me
I was on cruise control (Cruise)
That's how you lose control (You)
And you gon' be what you pursue, I had to renew my goals

And for one second all my problems
Fade to gray like no one saw 'em
I get a God's eye view on everything
Lookin' out my window pane'
Wheels up with the seats back
Wheels up with the seats back (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Some days I can't believe how far we made it
I thank God for the fans and pray for patience
At twenty-thousand feet, we climbing' straight up
Wheels up with the seats back
Wheels up with the seats

Listen, I done been through too much (Much)
Scared I'ma lose my touch (Touch)
Trying to hold what I can't have (Have)
Lord God, please loosen up my grasp
I been brokenhearted, mind departed, stopped and started, lost my hope and lost my way
I let my lust done bring destruction, no discussion with the God who gave me grace
5: 46 in the morning, mind still turning, God had to bring me back
I ain't even really want to rap no more
Wheels up with the seats back let's go
Wow, people having dreams about me they was right, I was losing sight
Then I clicked my heels and then He lift the wheels and we above the clouds, there's no rain tonight
And I, I'm finally seeing with a clearer vision I believe
God is greater than all of this trouble that I see
Trapped under the sea I wait to see what swallow me
I'm finally free, yeah

And for one second all my problems
Fade to gray like no one saw 'em
I get a God's eye view on everything
Lookin' out my window pane'
Wheels up with the seats back
Wheels up with the seats back (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Some days I can't believe how far we made it
I thank God for the fans and pray for patience
At twenty-thousand feet, we climbing straight up
Wheels up with the seats back
Wheels up with the seats

Wheels up with the seats back
Some days I can't believe how far we made it
I thank God for the fans and pray for patience
At twenty-thousand feet, we climbing' straight up
Wheels up with the seats back
Wheels up with the seats"
