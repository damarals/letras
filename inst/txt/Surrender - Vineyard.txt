"1" "Surrender
Vineyard

I'm giving You my heart
And all that is within
I lay it all down
For the sake of You my King
I'm giving you my dreams
I'm laying down my rights
I'm giving up my pride
For the promisse of new life

And I surrender all to You
All to You
And I surrender all to You
All to You

I'm singing You this song
I'm waiting at the cross
And all the world holds dear
I count it all as loss
For the sake of knowing You
For the glory of Your name
To know the lasting joy
Even sharing in Your pain"
