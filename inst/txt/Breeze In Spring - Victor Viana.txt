"1" "Breeze In Spring
Victor Viana

For too long I have lived
With no purpose in me
Like a breeze in spring
Meet an end with no begin

I have seen with my eyes
All the pain we can bring
But the love in the eyes
Is what keep our heart beating

Oh the sky is watching on me
I don't deserve it, I guarantee
The price that he pay was the blood
That has open a path for you and me

So now we don't live our lives
But the life of the Three"
