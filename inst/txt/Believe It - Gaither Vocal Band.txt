Gaither Vocal Band

There are skeptics
And there are doubters
As there have always been
Those who try to prove that Jesus
Never rose again
But History is His witness
His tomb an empty shrine
So don't waste your time
Looking for remains
His body you'll never find

Believe
Believe
Believe it
Don't let the darkness blind you
Believe
Believe
Believe it
Open your eyes and see

He lived
He died
He lives again
And waits for you
To let Him in

Trusting in their reason, Lord
Disciples suffered for His name
Jailed and tortured by the state
They loved Him just the same
Well they sealed their faith in Jesus
As they gave themselves to die
Well do you think those saints of all
Would've given their lifes for a lie?

Believe
Believe
Believe it
Don't let the darkness blind you
Believe
Believe
Believe it
Open your eyes and see

Believe
Believe
Believe it
Throw off the chains that bind you
Believe
Believe
Believe it
Jesus can set you free

He lived
He died
He lives again
And waits for you
To let Him in

Believe
Believe
Believe it
Don't let the darkness blind you
Believe
Believe
Believe it
Open your eyes and

Believe
Believe
Believe it
Throw off the chains that bind you
Believe
Believe
Believe it
Open you eyes and believe..."
