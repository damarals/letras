"1" "I'll Find You ft. Tori Kelly
Lecrae

Just fight a little longer my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you

I'm hanging on by a thread
And all I'm clinging to is prayers
And every breath is like a battle
I feel like I ain't come prepared
And death's knocking on the front door
Pain is creeping through the back
Fear is crawling through the windows
Waiting for 'em to attack
They say don't get bitter, get better
I'm working on switching them letters
But tell God
I'mma need a whole lot of hope
keeping it together
I'm smilin' in everyone's face
I'm cryin' whenever they leave the room
They don't know the battle I face
They don't understand what I'm going through

The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trusting in you
Cuz' I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do

Just fight a little longer my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you've got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you've got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you

They say fear haunts
And pain hates
I say pain strengthens
And fear drives faith
And I don't know all of the outcomes
Don't know what happens tomorrow
But when that ocean of doubt comes
Don't let me drown in my sorrow
And don't let me stay at the bottom
I feel like this hole is too deep to climb
I've been looking for a way out
But I'll settle for a peace of mind
Picking up the pieces of my life
and hoping that I put together something right
Tell me all I got is all I need
Tell me you gon' help me stand and fight

The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trusting in you
Cuz' I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do

No don't let the fear
Make you feel like you can't fight this on your own
You know I, I'll be there for you
no matter where you go
You'll never be alone, noo

Just fight a little longer my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you've got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you've got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you"
