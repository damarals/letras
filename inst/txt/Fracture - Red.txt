Red

[Verse 1]
My wandering heart
Was searching
Your lovely eyes were blinding
Now we're at the edge
Throw me
I hit the ground
Crashing

[Chorus]
Shattered, need you more than ever
Crawling to you, fracture
Lifeless
Falling into madness
Crawling, I am fractured
Fracture

[Verse 2]
This is how the pain of breaking [?]
This does not define us
Calling out
Reaching for you

[Chorus]
Shattered, need you more than ever
Crawling to you, fracture
Lifeless
Falling into madness
Crawling, I am fractured
Fracture

[Bridge]
Fracture
Desire
Fracture
The pain

Crawling
Shattered
Desire
Fracture

[Chorus]
Lifeless
Falling into madness
Crawling, I am fractured
Fracture"
