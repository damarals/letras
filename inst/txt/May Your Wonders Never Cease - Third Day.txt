Third Day

Father in Heaven
Lord may your name be glorified
above all others, above all this world
above everything else in our lives

for nothing else in all of this world matters
but to live our lives for your and you alone

May your wonders never cease
may your spirit never leave
may we ever long to see your face
and when we turn from you again
oh how quickly we forget
may we be reminded of your grace
May Your Wonders Never Cease

Beautiful savoir
Truly we praise your Love for us
while we as sinners
in all our weakness
and still you gave your life on the cross

you saved us lord from all of our transgressions
and delivered us into your loving arms

May your wonders never cease
may your spirit never leave
may we ever long to see your face
and when we turn from you again
oh how quickly we forget
may we be reminded of your grace
May Your Wonders Never Cease

Father in Heaven
Lord may your name be glorified
above all others, above all this world
above everything else in our lives

for nothing else in all of this world matters
but to live our lives for your and you alone

May your wonders never cease
may your spirit never leave
may we ever long to see your face
and when we turn from you again
oh how quickly we forget
may we be reminded of your grace
