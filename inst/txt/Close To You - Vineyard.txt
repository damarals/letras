"1" "Close To You
Vineyard

I long to be, so close to You
So close to You, I feel You breathe
I long to see, Your life in me
Your life in me, so others see

Only in You, I'm satisfied
This world can't give what you can
Only in You do I find life
You've shown Your love, since the world began

Better one day in Your house oh Lord
Than a thousand elsewhere

My soul yearns after You oh Lord
You are the one I long for"
