"1" "This Ain't No Ordinary Love Song
P.O.D.

I don't belong
Too many wrongs
I'm so undeserving
I'm lost inside
Confusing minds
A slave
To what I'm feeling
Scared of
What I'm thinking
I'm not worried
About forgiving you
The simple truth

This ain't no
Ordinary love song

This love undone
Words left unsung
Now i have become me
The reasoning
Escapes my soul
That leads
To understanding
Loving you to death
Is stopping someone else
From living too
Now it's killing you

Losing control
To all my thoughts
I want to let go
But i cannot
This is my love
It's all i got
Don't take there
In hell I'll rot

This is my love
It's all i got"
