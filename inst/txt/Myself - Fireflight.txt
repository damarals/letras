Fireflight

You turned a page, inside my heart,
Brought the light when my world was so dark
I feel something I cant explain
You consumed me and took on my shame

Everything is gone that held me down,
Your arms are around me
All the pain has left my selfish heart,
And Your love it surrounds me

You woke me up and made me learn to love more than myself
You took my hand before I knew there was more than myself

Eyes opened wide, I see your face
For the first time Im not in my way
A love like I have never known
A veil is lifted, now Im not alone

Now that I know, Ive finally found my home
This life is not my own
Whatever we go through
I will follow you"
