Skillet

Things are coming down
Things are coming down I can tell you
Beautiful the sound
Of things coming 'cause I heard him say

Division is coming down
I saw peace on a white horse riding
Love is spreading around
The most contagious disease we've ever known

I will drink from the well of the One who gives me life
I will eat of the bread of the One sacrifice
I will breathe of the breath of the body of God
I will dive to the depths and raise a new man

Racism is coming down
Not from law but a change in perception
Revival's spreading around
I hear the sound of reapers already say

I will drink from the well of the One who gives me life
I will eat of the bread of the One sacrifice
I will breathe of the breath of the body of God
I will dive to the depths and raise a new man

Our knees are going down
To the One who brings far to my every bone
His Kingdom's reigning down
Who can stop the plans of the Lord I say

I will drink from the well of the One who gives me life
I will eat of the bread of the One sacrifice
I will breathe of the breath of the body of God
