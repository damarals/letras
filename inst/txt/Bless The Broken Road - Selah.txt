"1" "Bless The Broken Road
Selah

I set out on a narrow way,
Many years ago
Hoping I would find true love
Along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow, kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign,
Pointed straight to you

But every long lost dream
Led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart,
They were just northern stars
Pointing me on my way,
Into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road
That led me straight to you

I think about the years I spent,
Just passing through
I'd like to take the time I lost,
And give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of this grander plan,
That is coming true

And every long lost dream
Led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart,
They were just northern stars
Pointing me on my way,
Into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road
That led me straight to you

Oh, straight to you...

Now I'm just rolling home
Into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road
That led me straight to you

Yes, God bless the broken road
That led me straight
To you

Oh, straight to you..."
