"x"
"1" "Crave You
Robinson Monteiro

There was a time in my life
It was lighter
And better
When you came around
Made me forget
What I was so sad about
Sad about everything

Just like that
You've taken all that you had given back

And now I can see
You're no good for me
Why do I feel like I need you?
Locked in sweet misery
Somehow I still want you
You do not care for me
But I crave you
I crave you
I crave you
I crave you

I can't help thinking of you
Situations in my head
Do nothing for me
Lead me back to a dead end
And I try to leave you behind

Just like that
I lose the love
I thought I had
Found in you

And now I can see
You're no good for me
Why do I feel like I need you
Locked in sweet misery
Somehow I still want you
You do not care for me
But I crave you
I crave you
I crave you
I crave you

And you do not care for me
You do not care for me
And you never
And you never will

And now I can see
You're no good for me
Why do I feel like I need you
Locked in sweet misery
Somehow I still want you
You do not care for me
But I crave you
I crave you
I crave you
I crave you
I crave you"
