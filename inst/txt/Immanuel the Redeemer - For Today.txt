"1" "Immanuel (the Redeemer)
For Today

You’re not alone, my son.
I made you for so much more than this.
Don’t be afraid, my child.,
for I have overcome the world.
Go tell the world that I would die for them to know me.
And I would die for them to live.
And this is life: that they would know you, God,
and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.

This is life, child.
I’ll give you everything.
And you can stand tall for there is life in me.
Now, let the blood I shed be just enough for you
to know that you will always have a home with me--no,
you will not be abandoned.

All hell will not stand against us,
for only those who choose to die will claim
the life I have for them.

So now the question stands: Would you die for me?

Can you hear it?
Can you hear my voice?
I’ve been calling you since the day you were born,
to come home to the place I’ve prepared for you.
You’re not alone."
