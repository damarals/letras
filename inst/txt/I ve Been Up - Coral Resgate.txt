"1" "I ve Been Up
Coral Resgate

I've been up, I've been down
But I'll never turn around
I've been glad, I've been sad
But I'll never turn around

I remember lord, what you've done for me
I remember lord how you set me free
I remember lord how you brought me out

But I'll never, never
No, no, no, no, no, no
Don't turn around

Ôoh, ôoh, ôoh, ôoh, ôoh
Ôoh, ôoh, ôoh, ôoh
Ôoh, ooh, ooh ôh never"
