Hillsong United

Righteous
Ruler of the heavens
Holy holy our God
Sovereign
Lord of all creation
Holy holy our God

Every tribe and tongue
Lift your voice as one
He is greatly to be praised

Sing to the Lord
Oh my soul
Let the heavens
Shout for joy
Great is our God
Great is our God

Nations come and
Bow before Him
Holy holy our God
Angels sing
Now and forever
Holy holy our God

The heavens shall declare
The glory of our great God

Jesus
Come let us adore Him
Holy holy our God"
