Toby Mac

She blew everything to pieces
He's there hanging on to Jesus
She broke everything about him down
He said he never saw it coming
Until the day she dropped the bomb
And she broke everything about him down

Sometimes there's nothing left but to believe
And suddenly all of it's behind you
And I'm here to remind you
That yesterday is gone so say goodbye
And suddenly the skies open above you
And someone really loves you
Now everything's alive ... everything's alive

She's there broken into pieces
But he swares he doesn't really see it
When she says that all of it was so unfair
But Hope road is just around the corner
It's one place there's never been a foreigner
'Cause God's love makes everybody welcome there
Sometimes there's nothing left but to believe

Sometimes there's nothing left but to believe
And suddenly all of it's behind you
And I'm here to remind you
That yesterday is gone so say goodbye
And suddenly the skies open above you
And Jesus really loves you
Now everything's alive ... everything's alive

Sometimes it's in an instant
Sometimes we wait for years
But it comes down to the moment when faith eclipses fear
Your wandering is over
The other side is real
You've broken through
Your mountain moved
And mercy is revealed
His mercy is revealed, yeah

Yesterday is long
Gone ....

And suddenly all of it's behind you
And I'm here to remind you
That yesterday is gone so say goodbye
And finally the skies open around you
And love has truly found you
Now everything is alive
Everything's alive ... everything's alive

Sometimes there's nothing left but to believe"
