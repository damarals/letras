"1" "Jesus, Friend Of Sinners
Casting Crowns

Jesus friend of sinners we have strayed so far away
We cut down people in your name but the sword was never ours to swing
Jesus friend of sinners the truth's become so hard to see
The world is on their way to you but they're tripping over me
Always looking around but never looking up I'm so double minded
A plank eyed saint with dirty hands and a heart divided

Oh jesus friend of sinners
Open our eyes to world at the end of our pointing fingers
Let our hearts be led by mercy
Help us reach with open hearts and open doors
Oh jesus friend of sinners break our hearts for what breaks yours

Yeah...

Jesus friend of sinners the one who's writing in the sand
Make the righteous turn away and the stones fall from their hands
Help us to remember we are all the least of thieves
Let the memory of your mercy bring your people to their knees

Nobody knows what we're for only against when we judge the wounded
What if we put down our signs crossed over the lines and loved like you did

Oh jesus friend of sinners
Open our eyes to world at the end of our pointing fingers
Let our hearts be led by mercy
Help us reach with open hearts and open doors
Oh jesus friend of sinners break our hearts for what breaks yours

You love every lost cause; you reach for the outcast
For the leper and the lame; they're the reason that you came
Lord I was that lost cause and I was the outcast
But you died for sinners just like me a grateful leper at your feet

'cause you are good, you are good and your love endures forever
You are good, you are good and your love endures forever
You are good, you are good and your love endures forever
You are good, you are good and your love endures forever


Oh jesus friend of sinners
Open our eyes to world at the end of our pointing fingers
Let our hearts be led by mercy
Help us reach with open hearts and open doors
Oh jesus friend of sinners break our hearts for what breaks yours

And I was the lost cause and I was the outcast
Yeah...
You died for sinners just like me, a grateful leper at your feet"
