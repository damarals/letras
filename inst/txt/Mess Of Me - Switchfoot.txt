"1" "Mess Of Me
Switchfoot

I am my own affliction
I am my own disease
There ain't no drug that they can sell
There ain't no drug to make me well

There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
It's not enough
The sickness is myself

- Chorus -
I've made a mess of me
I want to get back the rest of me
I've made a mess of me
I want to spend the rest of my life alive

We lock our souls in cages
We hide inside our shells
It's hard to free the ones you love
When you can't forgive yourself

- Chorus -
I've made a mess of me
I want to reverse this tragedy
I've made a mess of me
I want to spend the rest of my life alive
