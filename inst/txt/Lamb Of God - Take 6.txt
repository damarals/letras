Take 6

Your only son no sin to hide
But you have sent him from your side
To walk upon this guilty sod
And to become (and become) the Lamb of God

Your gift of Love (gift of Love) they crucified
They laughed and scorned him as he died (Oh)
The humble king they named a fraud
And sacrificed the Lamb of God

O lamb of God (O lamb of God)
Sweet Lamb Of God (Lamb Of God)
I love that holy Lamb of God
O wash me in his precious blood…
My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God

Holy, Holy, Holy
Merciful and mighty Almighty
He’s King of Kings and Lord of Lords

O lamb of God (O Lamb of God)
Sweet lamb Of God (Lamb Of God)
I love that holy lamb of God
O wash me in the blood…
That precious flow…Oh the blood
My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God
My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God"
