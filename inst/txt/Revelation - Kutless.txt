Lord, we come before your throne
We lay our crowns of gold down at your feet
Lord, we stand and we will sing
Behold the lamb, by his blood we are redeemed

You are holy, great and mighty
Who was and who is to come
You are worthy, surrounded in glory
All honor and power are yours

Face to face before our king
As saints and angels join to bring you praise
On that day there'll be no more pain
For you, oh lord, will wipe all our tears away

You are holy, great and mighty
Who was and who is to come
You are worthy, surrounded in glory
All honor and power are yours

The lightning flashes, the thunder rolls
Every nation gathers, before your throne
As the lightning flashes, the thunder rolls
Every nation gathers, before your throne

You are holy, great and mighty
Who was and who is to come
You are worthy, surrounded in glory
All honor and power are yours

All power is yours
All honor is yours
The power is yours"
