"1" "My Jesus, I Love Thee
Youthful Praise

My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine;
For thee all the follies of sin I resign.
My gracious redeemer, my Savior art thou;
If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
I love thee because thou has first loved me,
And purchased my pardon on calvary's tree.
I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow;
If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
In mansions of glory and endless delight,
I'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright;
I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow;
If ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now"
