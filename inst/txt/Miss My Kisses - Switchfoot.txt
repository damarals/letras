"1" "Miss My Kisses
Switchfoot

It isn’t me it’s my attention that you’re missing
It ain’t my voice, but all the sweet things that I said
I’m not your only honey bee, who are you kidding?
So sing your sad song to the rest, let them believe they get your best

It’s time that we both stop faking
No offense, none taken
Honey you weren’t looking for a misses
Mister you won’t miss me, you just miss my kisses

Don’t say my number and you won’t ever find me calling
I was happy before we met, even better after you left
You can keep your seasons and I will keep my sunshine
Keep your money and your time, and I’ll hold on to mine

It’s time that we both stop faking
No offense, none taken
Honey you weren’t looking for a misses
Mister you won’t miss me, you just miss my kisses

You won’t miss me, you just miss my kisses

Please don’t make a scene
And don’t pretend to cry
Just smile and goodnight
And kiss me goodbye one last time

It’s time that we both stop faking
No offense, none taken
Honey you weren’t looking for a misses
Mister you won’t miss me, you just miss my kisses"
