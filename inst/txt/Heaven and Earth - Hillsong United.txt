Hillsong United

Love that was foretold
When the prophets spoke
Of One to come
Heaven came for us
Reconciling hearts to You our God

Heaven and earth collide
The Saviour for everyone has come
Bringing the dead to life
All for the glory of Your name

Now He comes with hope
In salvation's robe
To lead us home
Healing in His wings, freedom in His scars
His kingdom come

Heaven and earth collide
The Saviour for everyone has come
Bringing the dead to life
All for the glory of Your name

By His stripes we are healed
By his death we can live
In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name

All oppression will cease
Every captive released
In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name

By His stripes we are healed
By his death we can live
In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name

All oppression will cease
Every captive released
In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name

By His stripes we are healed
By his death we can live
In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name

All oppression will cease
Every captive released
In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name"
