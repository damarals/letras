"1" "Beautiful Music
Amy Grant

Once my life had
No direction,
I was lost as could be.
I was caught in a whirlpool (caught in a whirlpool)
Spinning around in misery.

I needed a friend,
You took me in,
And you touched my heart
With your song of love
And gave me a brand new start.

Now there's beautiful music
Flowing on through me
Just like you said.
Angels singing,
Joy bells ringing
Inside my head,
Since you came inside me. (Since you came inside me.)
Now I'm lost inside your love.

You gave me just enough
To make hunger
For more of you.
Now I'm hooked on your lovin',
And I don't want to break loose.

With my heart in my hand,
I'm yours to command;
Do what you want me to.
Just never let me go,
Lord, I'm so in love with you.

Now there's beautiful music
Flowing on through me
Just like you said.
Angels singing,
Joy bells ringing
Inside my head,
Since you came inside me. (Since you came inside me.)
Now I'm lost inside your love.

Beautiful music
Flowing on through me
Just like you said.
Angels singing, (Angels singing,)
Joy bells ringing
Inside my head.

Beautiful music
Flowing on through me
Just like you said.
Angels singing, (Angels singing,)
Joy bells ringing
Inside my head.
