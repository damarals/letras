"1" "And I Worship
Vineyard

I will worship You my Father
For giving me the gift of life
When I was afraid to live
I will worship You my Savior
For taking all Your Father's wrath
So I could receive His love

Chorus 1
You're more faithful than my fears
And You are more stronger than my pride
Your forgiveness melts my anger
You expose the things I hide

I will worship You my love
For taking every stain I wear
And calling me beautiful
I will worship You my friend
For laying down Your sinless life
When I was too proud to die

You're more faithful than my fears
And You are more stronger than my pride
Your forgiveness melts my anger
You expose the things I hide
I tremble in Your presence
I melt beneath Your gaze
Yes I wonder at Your mercy
And I bow before Your grace
And I worship"
