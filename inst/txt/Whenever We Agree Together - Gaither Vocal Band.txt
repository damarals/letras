"1" "Whenever We Agree Together
Gaither Vocal Band

Chorus
Whenever we agree together
The Holy Spirit starts to move
Whenever we agree together
His mighty power He will prove
His children love each other
'Til their hearts become as one
And two or three agree together
He has promised He will be there
And the work will be done

'That night when Paul and Silas
Were in chains in the county jail
Somebody must have been agreeing
A mighty power began to fill the place
All their fetters fell off
And the doors opened wide
Perfect timing for a big earthquake!

Repeat Chorus

When just a few believers
Came together all in one accord
Somebody must have been agreeing'
'Cause the jail began to shake
No longer weak
They began to speak
She-kin-ah glory shining on each face

Repeat Chorus 2 times

And two or three agree together
He has promised He will be there
And the work will be done"
