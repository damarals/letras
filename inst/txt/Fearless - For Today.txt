"x"
"1" "Fearless
For Today

We will not we will not we will not be afraid (x4)
We are fearless
Fearless!

We bare the mark of the uncreated god so what should we fear?
We made the scars of the holy risen son so tell me what should we fear
Every threat is hollow because our victory is already set in stone
We are the fearless

We will not we will not we will not be afraid (x2)

Though we stand in this dark valley (we will not be afraid) for we know that you are near (x2)
I can feel the courage rising in the hearts of the sons of god
I can feel a fire burning across the earth we stand as one
We are not dismayed by the darkness that surrounds us here because we know that when all
Hell closes in, if we stand and fight we are not alone
Though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death (we are not alone) we will fear no evil for you are near
We are the fearless ones

We will not we will not we will not be afraid (x2)

Though we stand in this dark valley (we will not be afraid) for we know that you are near (x2)
We can't stop the kingdom you'll see me bow at the throne of judgement day so let the devil come
We are fearless
Fearless!
So let the devil come!"
