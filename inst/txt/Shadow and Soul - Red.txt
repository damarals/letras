Red

This is not for you
You don't belong here
Caught in my soul
Caught inside the shadow
Buried, I kept you
Helpless, I'm reaching out
Waiting for me
Lost between

Shadow and soul, my untold still waits
Find me in the dark, I'll meet you below
Shadow and soul
My darkest love
You live in secret
My heart unknown
It calls, it cries to reach you

Hunger, abandon
I hid you right beneath
Dying darkly (suffer)
Arise, my only
Shadow and soul, my untold still waits
Find me in the dark, I'll meet you below
Shadow and soul

Dark and light
Caught between, caught between
Endless night
Underneath, underneath
Hunger, my untold, I'm waiting
Find me inside, the endless night, our endless night
My furtive soul

A heart unknown
It's buried alive
The boundary fades between
Shadow and soul
My untold still wait
Find me inside
The endless night
Our endless night"
