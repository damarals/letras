Switchfoot

Well I’m just a simple man with a simple plan
Trying to find my way home
And this dusted way with nothing left to say
I stagger and I roam

And I’m tired and I’m worn
And my clothes are kind of torn
From this long hard road
My arms and legs are weak
I continue to seek
And leave behind this load

- Chorus –

I need clarity and truth to be
And peace to make me whole
I want freedom to be come and hate to be done
And love to guide my soul
I want love, yeah, I want love

Standing on a battle line
I fight for my mind Aching to be free
In this war that I face as I long to embrace
And be with my king

There’s a fire in my soul, desire to be whole
Is deep within in my bones
Now I long to be near as I cast away fear
Running for Your throne"
