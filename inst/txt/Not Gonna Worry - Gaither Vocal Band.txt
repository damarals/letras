"1" "Not Gonna Worry
Gaither Vocal Band

Im not gonna worry,im not gonna fret.
i not gonna speculate on contemplate on how it might have been.
im not gonna worry,he's got the whole things in his hands.
I wont let it haunt me, I wont let it win.
Im not gonna ruminate or meditate on how it might have been.
Im gonna release it ,he's got the whole thing in his hands.
Maybe lately I started to resign,
But here it goes God only knows
It might just ease mind.
I m not gonna worry ,Im not gonna fret,
im just gonna wait and see and in between give thanks for what i get.
Im not gonna worry , he's got the whole thing in his hands.
Maybe lately i started to resign.
But here it goes God only knows
it might just ease my mind.
Im not gonna worry im not gonna fret,
Im not gonna speculate or contemplate what hasnt happened yet.
im not gonna worry he's got the whole thing in his hands
He's got the whole thing in his hands.
He's got the whole thing in his hands."
