"1" "Grace From Above
Ricardo SÃ¡

Your grace is enough for me oh Lord
Is everything that I need to live
Your love guides me
Though art is life
The only reason for my creation
I know that with you
I won?t be harmed
I know that your hands will protect me
Keep me walking in your path oh Lord
I just want to do what you want from me

Guide me, teach me
Show me how to walk in your ways
Guide me, teach me oh Lord
Guide me, teach me
Show me how to walk in your ways
Guide me, teach me oh Lord"
