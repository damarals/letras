"x"
"1" "Overflow
Chris Tomlin

here I bring my stains and crowns
gentle river wash me now
Your love is deeper than I know
Your waves higher than I can go
lead me in Your holiness
I will follow, I confess
glory is the song I sing
Your life is living me

(chorus:)
where would I be, without You, without You
where would I be without You

I will bow before the cross
cherish my redeemer's cost
there is nothing I can do
than only stand amazed by You
immersing You with everyday
wrapped up in Your arms of grace
nothing more, You're all I need
Your life is living me

(chorus)

(bridge:)
like a waterfall,
You fill my heart and overflow
like a candle flame,
You light my way and lead me as I go [2x]

where would I be, without You, without You

spirit overflow, let me overflow [4x]
let me overflow [4x]"
