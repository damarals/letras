"1" "Can't Stop Talking About Him
Gaither Vocal Band

I was on my way to california leavin' new york city far behind
Life was like a bundle of confusion, I was looking for a love that
I could never find
So I tuned into a gospel station, heard about a sweet salvation
And then I gave it all to him, my heart, my soul and my mind

And now I can't stop talkin' about him
Can't stop talkin' 'bout the changes has taken place in me
You know that I can't be livin' without him
Things are gettin' clear and I can finally see
My life is like a celebration
'cause I am a new creation
And now I can't stop talkin' about him, oh no
Everyday

So I was driving down the highway singing hallelujah
and feeling fine
When this lawman pulled me over, he said to me
I'm gonna walk the dotted line
He said I've got a strange suspicion,
wondering 'bout your conditon
I said I've got a taste of what it means to be alive

Wow and now I can't stop talkin' about him
Can't stop talkin' 'bout the changes has taken place in me
You know that I can't be livin' without him
Things are gettin' clear and I can finally see
My life is like a celebration
'cause I am a new creation
And now I can't stop talkin' about him, oh no
Everyday

So if you wonder why, why I'm so happy and free
Well I'm here to testify, look what he's doin' in me, in me

And now I can't stop talkin' about him
Can't stop talkin' 'bout the changes has taken place in me
You know that I can't be livin' without him
Things are gettin' clear and I can finally see
My life is like a celebration
Because I am a new creation
And now I can't stop talkin' about him
Can't be livin' without him
No, I can't stop talkin' about him, no, no, no
Everyday

Can't stop talkin' about him
Can't stop talkin' about him everyday (everyday)

I can't stop, I can't stop talkin', yo
I can't stop talkin' 'bout jesus
I can't stop, I can't stop talkin', yo
I can't stop talkin' 'bout jesus (just can't stop)
I can't stop talkin' about him

I can't stop talkin' about him
'cause he's been so good to me
Can't stop"
