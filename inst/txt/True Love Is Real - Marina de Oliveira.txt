"1" "True Love Is Real
Marina de Oliveira

Listen to the Lord when he calls you
Thats all you really gotta do
Before he breaks the chains and set you free
Hes gonna do to you like he did to me

Dont you be afraid to loose control
True love is te best thing that you ever know
Open up your heart anda you will feel what I feel
How true love is real

This love can really take you by the hand
youll never, ever, be alone again
Its time for you to change, make your mind
And from now on just leave yor past behind

I know sometimes is so hard to believe
The shadows around never stop closing in
You ve gotta see through
Anda true love you will see
Wil give you the strength to fulfil all your needs"
