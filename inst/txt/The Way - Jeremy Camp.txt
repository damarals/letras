"1" "The Way
Jeremy Camp

All creation cried out with longing
With groans only You could comprehend
And with wisdom, You always answer
And give the words of life so unfailing

And Your glory shines all around us
Your faithfulness shown for all to see
When we think of all of your wonders
The beauty of Your plan that's been revelead
We walk in Your light
We walk in it

CHORUS:
Shine, bright
Let Your glory fill this land
Lift high, the King of Kings and great I AM
Jesus, You are the way...

We can see the works of Your loving hands
With a hope and peace not made by man
When You poured out Your grace and Your mercy
And You held out Your arms
So we could see
You bleed for all mankind
And set the captives free

CHORUS

Na, na, na, na, na, na, Jesus...
