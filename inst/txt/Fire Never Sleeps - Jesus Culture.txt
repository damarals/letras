"1" "Fire Never Sleeps
Jesus Culture

I feel the heat is rising the flames on the horizon are at my door
I'm staring at the ruins the embers of
Our brokenness are scattered on the floor
This Fire never sleeps, His Fire never sleeps

I see that hope is coming so pull me
From the ashes ignite my soul
Please burn away the darkness
This love is like a furnace where Fire never sleeps

Burn oh my soul set me on fire
Burn oh my soul light up the fire
Burn oh my soul

Stop, I never want to miss You something new
Is being born and we were born for this

Lord, we know a day is coming when we look into
Your eyes and see Fire that never sleeps
His Fire never sleeps, this fire never sleeps

Burn oh my soul set me on fire
Burn oh my soul light up the fire
Burn oh my soul, Your Fire never sleeps
Your Fire never sleeps

Purify my heart, purify my heart
Spirit fall on us, Spirit fall on us"
