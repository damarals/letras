"1" "Look Up Child
Lauren Daigle

Where are You now?
When darkness seems to win
Where are You now?
When the world is crumbling

Oh, I
I, I hear You say
I hear You say
Look up, child
Look up, child

Where are You now?
When all I feel is doubt
Where are You now?
When I can't figure it out

Oh, I
I, I hear You say
I hear You say
Look up, child
Look up, child

You're not threatened by the war
You're not shaken by the storm
I know, You're in control

Even in our suffering
Even when it can't be seen
I know, You're in controll

Oh, I
I, I hear You say
I hear You say
Look up, child
Look up, child

(I hear You say, You say, You say)
Look up, child
(I hear You say, You say, You say)
Look, look up, child

(I hear You say, You say, You say)
Look up, child
(I hear You say, You say, You say)
Look, look up, child

I hear You, I hear You calling my name
(I hear You say, You say, You say)
Look, look up, child

Look up, child
Look up"
