Selah

Holy father, love me still
I have fallen from your will
I am broken
Hear my humble cry
My cry

I have wandered for so long
Tired and weary on my own
In your arms I know Iâ€™m home, O God
My God

Take my life and make it yours, Lord
Fill me with your love
You are all I need
I surrender all of me

Take my life and make it yours, Lord
Fill me with your love
You are all I need
I surrender
I surrender
I surrender all of me"
