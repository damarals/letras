"x"
"1" "Everything
Jeremy Camp

I tried to find anything I could
To fill the void that I had felt inside,
I tried to hide because I never could
Release the very guilt that was in my mind,
But every time that I’d trace these lines,
I’d feel like I had been so blind cause

[CHORUS]
You are everything that I hope for,
Everything that I breathe for,
Everything that this heart will need,
Everything that I hope for,
Everything that I crave

Sometimes I feel a fight to release the grip
And trust that everything will be alright
It’s been so real to feel the peace that you give
Start unfolding when I let things go,
Every weight that I build inside,
When I lay it down I realize that

All these pointless ties to endless lies
That this temporal life will satisfy,
I hide my life in you"
