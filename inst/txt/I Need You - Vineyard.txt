"1" "I Need You
Vineyard

Arms up hands opening
I know that You are near
I'm trusting in Your grace
I've set aside my fear
Darkness still clings to me
Day springs in front of me
I need You like nothing else at all

I need You to save me
I need You to lead me
I need You my God like nothing else at all
I need You to keep me
I am leaning on Your mercy
I need You my God like nothing else at all
I need You my God like nothing else at all

Heart chilled but warming up
I'm calling on You now
Long nights of wondering
But I have heard Your call
Words forming on my lips
Jesus save my soul
I need You like nothing else at all

(BRIDGE)
I need You
I need You
I need You my God like nothing else at all"
