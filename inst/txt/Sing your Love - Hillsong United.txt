"1" "Sing (your Love)
Hillsong United

It used to be darkness
Without You
I lived my life in blindness
But now I'm found

And I'll sing, sing I love You so
And I'll sing
Because the world can't take away
Your love

Found me in weakness
Broken
You came to me in kindness
and now I live

I'll give my life for You Lord
For all You've done"
