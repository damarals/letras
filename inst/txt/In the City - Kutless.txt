Bless this city in Jesus' name
Let your healing fall like rain
God you gave us everything
May your church do more than sing

Bless this city in Jesus' name
Wake up every heart you've changed
Help us be your hands and feet
May your love flood every street

Father, make us one
Let your kingdom come in the city
Glorify your son
Let your will be done in the city
In the city

Bless this city in Jesus' name
Tear down walls we've built in vain
Let our kingdoms be replaced
With unity that shows your face

Father, make us one
Let your kingdom come in the city
Glorify your son
Let your will be done in the city
In the city
In the city

Father, make us one
Let your kingdom come in the city
Glorify your son
Let your will be done in the city
In the city

Bless this city in Jesus' name
Let your healing fall like rain
God you gave us everything
May your church do more than sing"
