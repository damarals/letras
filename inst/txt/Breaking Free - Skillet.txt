Skillet

This night, nothing like any other night
can't take anymore
You say I'll never be nothing
cause us suffering, something to ignore

These things you say
You make me weak but I have changed
No way, I am stronger than before

I will break, breaking free, coming alive
I broke these chains, never be afraid to live
my life (never be afraid to live my life)
Break, breaking free, one last time
No matter what they say, I will never change
And I know I can break (break) break (break)
Look out, I'm breaking free

This is who I am
You don't understand
you never even try just when
I think you're listening
Drop defence, you stab and twist the knife

These things (these things) you say (you say)
They don't hold me, I'm not your slave
No way, I'm stronger than before

I will break, breaking free, coming alive
I broke these chains, never be afraid to live
my life (never be afraid to live my life)
Break, breaking free, one last time
No matter what they say, I will never change
And I know I can break (break) break (break)
Look out, I'm breaking free

Overcome, chains undone
No fear can hold me down
I know I can rise above it
Overcome, chains undone
No fear can hold me down
I know I can rise above it

I will break, breaking free, coming alive
I broke these chains, never be afraid to live
my life (never be afraid to live my life)
Break, breaking free, one last time
No matter what they say, I will never change

And I know I can break (break) break (break)
I will break (I will break)
Look out, I'm breaking free
I'm breaking free (breaking breaking
this is freedom, this is freedom)
I am breaking free"
