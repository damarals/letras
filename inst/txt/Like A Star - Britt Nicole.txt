"1" "Like A Star
Britt Nicole

Been working overtime
And getting sick of these crazy games
I'll be a satellite
And wait for someone to enter my gaze

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it
Yeah the light in your eyes
And I wonder
when you're loking in mine
Do you see them like a star in the sky?

You got me falling for you
And I won't stop 'till I hit the clouds
See I don't wanna hide these feeling
Or even try to figure them out

Sparks flying all around electricity
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
Ten feet on the ground
No gravity
Fly with me, fly with me

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it
Yeah the light in your eyes
And I wonder
when you're loking in mine
Do you see them like a star in the sky?

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it
Yeah the light in your eyes
And I wonder
when you're loking in mine
Do you see them like a star in the sky?

Way up high satellite
You and I identify

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it
Yeah the light in your eyes
And I wonder
when you're loking in mine
Do you see them like a star in the sky?

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it
Yeah the light in your eyes
And I wonder
when you're loking in mine
Do you see them like a star in the sky?

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it
Yeah the light in your eyes
And I wonder
when you're loking in mine
Do you see them like a star in the sky?

Sparks flying all arround electricity
Dance with me, dance with me dance with me
Ten feet on the ground
No gravity
Fly with me, fly with me"
