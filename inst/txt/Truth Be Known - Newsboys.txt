"1" "Truth Be Known
Newsboys

She tries a little denial
Rolls her eyes like a jaded reptile
True/false questions make her uptight
Opposites attract, so they both must be right

What if there’s someone up there?
Shrugs it off with a “don’t know, don’t care”
Hopes to God he doesn’t exist
But ignorance here is less than bliss

If the truth be known
Everybody gets their shot!
She is diving down
Gonna make her home now
The ocean
She’s done with living her life
On the ground
She’s sinking down
Hands above her
Held her
Nineteen years
And now they’re letting go
Tomorrow will be ‘round
And everyone will see
No tragedy
It’s like it’s over
But it’s just begun"
