Divider

You work hard to bring me down
Disregard good that I have found
Take your negativity away

I'm on guard and watching you
I'm diehard with everything I do
A fighter in every way

(Chorus)
Hey - Hey - Outsider
Hey - Hey - Divider

There you are without reason
From afar committing treason
There's nothing you'd do or say

To make me lose my vision
I've made my choice, my decision
All your lies won't make me sway

Hey - Hey - Outsider
Hey - Hey - Divider"
