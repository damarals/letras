"1" "Turn It All Down
Vineyard

Turn it all down
Tune it all out
You and me

Away from the crowds
Away from the noise
Is where I wanna be

(So) If I had my way I would stop this day
So I could worship You
And keep this world at bay
There I'd stay

I want to be right by Your side
For You are the light of my life
And all I want to do is give this life to You
Jesus forever, Jesus forever

I'll let it all go, the things that I hold
That bring me down
You're life to my soul, I'm more than I know
You've turned me around"
