Sebhastti√£o Alves

Come, this is the time of worship
Communion and worship
Come, this is the hour of worship
Come, give him your heart
Come, just as you are to worship

Come, just as you stand before the father comes

Every tongue will confess the lord
Every knee will bend
But he that receiveth thee
The bigger treasure will have"
