"1" "He Died
Britt Nicole

The day turned into night
Heaven closed her eyes
The father turned away
The people stood and stared
They could not understand
That he would rise again

And he died for you that day
No matter what they say
He lives forevermore
All he wants is to hear you say
That you'll die with him tonight
He'll make everything alright
So darling dry your eyes
And die in him tonight

The angels they all cried the night that Jesus died
Their hearts were broken in two
Just like you're crying now
Just like you're broken here
Oh, stop running away

And he died for you that day
No matter what they say
He lives forevermore
All he wants is to hear you say
That you'll die with him tonight
He'll make everything alright
So darling dry your eyes
And die in him tonight

Lately you've been feeling that you need to be healed
The pain that's deep inside you
You know it cannot hide you
You know it cannot hide you

And he died for you that day
No matter what they say
He lives forevermore
All he wants is to hear you say
That you'll die with him tonight
He'll make everything alright
So darling dry your eyes
And die in him tonight
Die in him tonight
Live for him tonight"
