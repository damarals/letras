"1" "Know You More
Hillsong United

You hold it all at once
The earth and all within
You look with eyes of love
To the sons of man
That I am known by you
Compels my heart to sing

I live to know You more
I live to know You more
I live to know You more
For me to live is Christ
To know You is my life

The storms will come and go
There's laughter and there's pain.
Your kindness leads me on
To the light again
So I live and breathe
And find myself in You

I live to know You more
I live to know You more
I live to know You more
For me to live is Christ
To know You is my life

I live to know You
I live to know You
I live to know You more"
