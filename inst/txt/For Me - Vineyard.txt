"1" "For Me
Vineyard

I know that You’re there when I cry
With every heartbeat You’re there by my side

You’re for me
I know that You’re for me
You’re for me

I know that You’re for me
I know that You’re there when I call

Your love to surround me Your grace to restore
All that I am I give to You

For I know that You will break through
I give You my heart for I know that You"
