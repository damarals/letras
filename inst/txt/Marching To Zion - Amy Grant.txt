Marching to Zion

Come ye that love the Lord, and let your joys be known,
Join in a song with sweet accord, Join in a song with sweet accord.
And thus surround the throne, and thus surround the throne.

We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion; the beautiful city of God

Then let our songs a bound and every tear be dry;
We're marching through Immanuel's ground; weæŠ®e marching through Immanuel's
ground,
To fairer worlds on high, to fairer worlds on high.

We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion; the beautiful city of God

We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion; the beautiful city of God
