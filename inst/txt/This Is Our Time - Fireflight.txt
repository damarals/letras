"1" "This Is Our Time
Fireflight

You can't shake it, shake the feeling that there's more
More to life than what you know
There's a whisper
Hear it screaming, can't ignore it
Something you cannot control
There is no hesitating
There is no time for waiting
We never stop we only go

It starts tonight
We are alive
This is our time
This is out time
At the speed of night
Nothing left to hide
This is our time
This is our time

Do you hear it, hear it calling like
A siren that will never let you go
Do you feel it, feel it tugging at your heart
It's the voice that calls you home
There is no hesitating
There is no time for waiting
We never stop we only go"
