Gaither Vocal Band

Could that view from your window
Be a little bit brighter?
Could that load you've been carrying
Feel a little bit lighter?

Well hold on, just hold on
That crayon sun's got a smile on its face
Those clouds hangin' 'round no, they ain't gonna stay
Keep your arms wide open 'cause it's heading' your way

Look, come yonder there's a better day
Better day...better day...
Could those legs you've been walkin' on
Feel a little bit stronger?

Could that rain you've been walking through
Not last much longer?
Well hold on, just hold on
Oh, that crayon sun's got a smile on its face

Those clouds hangin' 'round, no they ain't gonna stay
Keep your arms wide open 'cause it's heading' your way
Look, come yonder there's a better day
Better day...better day...

Keep your arms wide open 'cause it's heading' your way
Look, come yonder there's a better day
Better day...better day...
Could those dreams you've been dreamin'

Find a few more believers?
Could that song you've been singin'
Be a little bit sweeter?
Well, that crayon sun's got a smile on its face

Those clouds hangin' 'round, no they ain't gonna stay
Keep your arms wide open 'cause it's heading' your way
Look, come yonder there's a better day
Better day...better day...

There's gonna be a better day
There's gonna be a better day"
