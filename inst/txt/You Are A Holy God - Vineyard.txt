"1" "You Are A Holy God
Vineyard

You are a holy God
An all consuming fire
You're robed in majesty
Bright shining as the sun

Your ways are not our ways
Your thoughts are high above
You are the fountain Lord
Of mercy truth and live (and we cry)

Holy, holy is the Lord God most high
Holy, holy is the Lord God most high"
