Hillsong United

God of eternity You reign
With justice and mercy
Truth and grace
Gift of salvation to the lost
And by Your Word
You build Your Church
And Your Kingdom will know no end

Let Your voice be heard
In all of the earth
Let this generation rise to be
Your glorious Church
Hope to the nations
Let this generation rise now

For such a time as this we've come
To carry the cause of Christ freedom
Lord raise up to be Your light
Your answer of hope to all of the world
And Your Kingdom will know no end

Now is the time right now
Your Church will arise now"
