"1" "Lord, I Am In Love With You (Apaixonado)
Comunidade Cat√≥lica Shalom

Of all the things I've seen in this world
Nothing compares to Your greatness, Lord
Of all the things of this world
Nothing is like Your infinite love
Some say: I am blind
And that was Jesus who made me so
But what really know is that I am in love
With You, Lord, with You Lord

Lord, I am in love with You
And now I want to give my life
For You Lord, only for You

To lose it all, to give it all
And only keep with me Your infinite love
For nothing in this world urges me
But only to do Your Will
And everyday feel Your love
Because I am in love with You
Lord, with You Lord"
