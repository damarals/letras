Marcos Witt

Isn’t God amazing?
Isn’t God amazing?
Isn’t His mercy and His grace
The beauty of His face… amazing?

Isn’t God amazing?
Isn’t God amazing?
Isn’t His love tenderness
His holy righteousness… amazing
He’s amazing!

He’s an amazing God
With amazing strength
Amazing grace
And amazing life
He has amazing power
He gives amazing joy
Amazing peace
And amazing love
Makes my heart sing out
As I bow at His throne
Makes my voice ring out
As I sing Him this song"
