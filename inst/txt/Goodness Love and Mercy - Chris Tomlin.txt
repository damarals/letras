Chris Tomlin

Oh Lord, You're my Shepherd
You make me lie in fields of green
You lead me by the still waters
You restore righteousness to me
Though I walk through the valley
I will fear no evil thing
For You are with me
And You comfort me

Surely goodness, love and mercy
Will follow wherever I go
Surely goodness, love and mercy
Will follow wherever I go
Surely goodness, love and mercy
Will follow wherever I go

Oh Lord, You're my Shepherd
You make me lie in fields of green
You lead me by the still waters
You restore righteousness to me
Though I walk through the valley
I will fear no evil thing
For You are with me, God
And You comfort me, You comfort me

Surely goodness, love and mercy
Will follow wherever I go
Surely goodness, love and mercy
Will follow wherever I go
Surely goodness, love and mercy
Will follow wherever I go

Oh yeah, wherever I go, wherever I go
Surely goodness, love and mercy

I'm gonna dwell in the house of the Lord forever
I said I'm gonna dwell in the house of the Lord forever
Sing it with me one time
I'm gonna dwell in the house of the Lord forever
Yes, I will
I'm gonna dwell in the house of the Lord forever
Wherever I goÂ…

Surely goodness, love and mercy
Will follow wherever I go
Surely goodness, love and mercy
Will follow wherever I go
Surely goodness, love and mercy
Will follow wherever I go"
