Have you not known, have you not heard
The lord is an everlasting god, an everlasting god
Have you not known, have you not heard
He is creator of the earth, the ends of the earth

Even the young will stumble and fall
You are the one that helps me through it all

You lift me up on eagle's wings
I can run and not grow weary
Always, when I wait for you
In you I will renew my strength
I can walk and never faint
Always, when I wait for you

Is it not told, not understood
Since the beginning of all time
The beginning of all time
Lift up your eyes
Behold his great might
He is the maker of all things
The maker of all things

Even the young will stumble and will fall
You are the one that helps me through it all

You lift me up on eagle's wings
I can run and not grow weary
Always, when I wait for you
In you I will renew my strength
I can walk and never faint
Always, when I wait for you

When I hope, when I trust
I will find my strength in you
When I hope, when I trust
I will find my strength in you
When I hope, when I trust
I will find my strength in you
When I hope, when I trust
I will find my strength in you

You lift me up on eagle's wings
I can run and not grow weary
Always, when I wait for you
In you I will renew my strength
I can walk and never faint
Always, when I wait for you

Always, when I wait for you"
