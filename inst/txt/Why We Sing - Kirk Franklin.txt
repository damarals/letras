"1" "Why We Sing
Kirk Franklin

Someone asked the question
Why do we sing?
When we lift our hands to Jesus
What do we really mean?

Someone may be wondering
When we sing our song
At times we're maybe crying
And nothings even wrong

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eye is on the sparrow
That's the reason why we sing

Glory
Hallelujah
You're the reason why we sing

Glory
Hallelujah
I give the praises to You

Glory
Hallelujah
You're the reason why we sing

And when the song is over
We've all said
Amen
In your heart just keep on singing
And the song will never end

And if someone asks you
Was it just a show
Lift your hands and be a witness
And tell the whole world
No

And when we cross that river
To study war no more
We will sing our songs to Jesus
The one that we adore
