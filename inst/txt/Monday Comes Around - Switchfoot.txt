"1" "Monday Comes Around
Switchfoot

Friday, Monday, comes around

She's a girl with the weight of the world on her big brown eyes
She's a girl who's been talking to herself to apologize
She'll never do it again she promised
But then she hasn't been all that honest
Can she trust herself to be herself
Or is she talking to herself again

Hey Friday what you gonna do now
When Monday comes around
Hey Friday what you gonna do now
When Monday comes around
When Monday comes around
Come around, when Monday comes around

Monday comes wondering where do you run to find a second start
Where do you go when you're broke and alone and Friday falls apart
Yeah, yeah
All these questions are leaving her shaking
Can you be two girls in one
Can your heart bend this much without breaking
You know that you know and you can never have it both ways

Hey Friday what you gonna do now
When Monday comes around
Hey Friday what you gonna do now
When Monday comes around
When Monday comes around
Come around, when Monday comes around
Come around, when Monday comes around
Come around, when Monday comes around

Don't take it easy
Don't take it easy
Who says somebody's giving and taking, giving and taking
Everybody's taking away
(Monday comes around...)
Friday, Monday, comes around..."
