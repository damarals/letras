I will trust in You
Though I walk the darkest path You pull me through
When I'm falling down it's Your love I cling to
My trust is in You

I will trust in You
Though I walk the darkest path You pull me through
When I'm falling down it's Your love I cling to
My trust is in You

So I'll take Your hand
You will lead me to waterfalls where grace and mercy flow
And wherever You call me I'll go
My trust is in You
My trust is in You

I will trust in You
You are with me throughout every high and low
Though I stumble I will never be alone
My trust is in You

In the shadows, You're my light and I will trust You
In the darkness, You're my guide and I will follow"
