"1" "Good Morning (feat Mandisa)
Toby Mac

Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Wave away my yesterday
'cause i'm leaving it behind me

Hello sunshine, come what may
I feel something new inside me
I hear the birds singing
Now my alarms ringing
Get up, get up
Hey!

It's a good morning
Wake up to a brand new day
This morning
I'm stepping
Stepping on my way
Good morning
You give me strength
You give me just what i need
And i can feel the hope that's rising in me
It's a good morning

Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Slow down, breathe in
Don't move ahead
I'm just living in this moment
I got my arms raised, un-phased
Jump out of bed

Gotta get this party going
I went to bed dreaming
You woke me up singing
Get up, get up
Hey!
'cause it's a good morning
Wake up to a brand new day

This morning
I'm stepping
Stepping on my way
Good morning
You give me strength
You give me just what i need
And i can feel the hope that's rising in me
It's a good morning

Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Now i'm smiling, and i'm kissing all my worries goodbye
Got the feeling, if i spread my wings, i might even fly
You are my truth, my way
Give me the strength to say
Get up, get up, get up
'cause it's a good morning
Oh yeah!

Hey
Top of the morning to you 'disa
You smoothie, me ice cold pizza
Cafe au lait, latte dah
You do the zumba, but i do not
Give me like half a marathon

I'll give you the gospel of st. john
Hits me like a wake-up bomb
Cuz' we both know that his mercy flows in the morning
It's a good morning

Wake up to a brand new day
This morning
I'm stepping
Stepping on my way
Good morning
You give me strength
You give me just what i need

And i can feel the hope that's rising in me
It's a good morning
Wake up to a brand new day
This morning
I'm stepping
Stepping on my way

Good morning
You give me strength
You give me just what i need
And i can feel the hope that's rising in me
It's a good morning
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh..."
