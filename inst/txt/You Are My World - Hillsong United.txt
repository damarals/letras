"1" "You Are My World
Hillsong United

My father I adore You more than
Everything my heart could wish for
I just want You
And Jesus, my beloved Saviour
Everything I have I owe to You
I owe it all to You

And angels come and adore You
And we Your children worship You

You are my world
You are my God
And I lay down my life for You
You are my Lord
The One I love
No one could ever take Your place

And everything I have I give to You
My Lord, the One I live for
I live for You
And all my days are gifts from You
I pray Iâ€™d use them as You want me to
Use them for You"
