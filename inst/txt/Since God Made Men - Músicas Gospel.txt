"1" "Since God Made Men
MÃºsicas Gospel

If luck could be bought,
And wisdom was taught.
We could change our life,
We would get things right.

But luck is not sold,
The dice must be rolled.
And wisdom is earned,
By the lessons we learn.

Chorus:
There are rules in life,
That just won't bend.
And they come again,
Until a time they end.
Since he formed clay,
Up till our final day.
This is how it's been,
Since God made men.

Our tears will be cried,
When a loved one dies.
We regret words spoke,
And a heart gets broke.

With age we'll turn gray,
God hears what we say.
All these things and more,
Will knock on our door.

Chorus:
There are rules in life,
That just won't bend.
And they come again,
Until a time they end.
Since he formed clay,
Up till our final day.
This is how it's been,
Since God made men."
