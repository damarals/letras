I need you more
More than yesterday
I need you more
More than words can say
I need you more
Than never before
I need you Lord, I need you Lord

More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than the next heartbeat
More than anything
and Lord as time goes by
I want to be by your side
Cause I never want to go back, to my old life

I need you more
More than yesterday
I need you more
More than words can say
I need you more
The never before
I need you Lord, I need you Lord

More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than the next I beat
More than anything
and Lord as time goes by
I want to be by your side
Cause I never want to go back, to my old life

I need you more
More than yesterday
I need you more
More than words can say
I need you more, God
The never before
I need you Lord, I need you Lord (2 vezez)

We give you the highest praise
We give you the highest praise
We give you the highest praise

We give you the highest praise
We give you the highest praise
We give you the highest praise

Sing it again: We give you!
We give you the highest praise
We give you the highest praise
We give you the highest praise

Your presence is life to me,
All of our praise, all our love
We gave you Lord, We gave you Lord.

More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than anything
I need you more

More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than anything
I need you more
More than any song I can ever sing
I need you more

(Kim Walker)
Tell him tonight.
Sing your own song to him and say:
You are all I want,God
You are all I want,God
You are all I want,God
I need you more
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than anything
I need you more

(Kim Walker)."
