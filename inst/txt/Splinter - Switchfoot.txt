Switchfoot

It's only illusions
It's only an ebb and flow
It's only a re-run
It's only a so and so
It's only a glimpse now
It's only a glancing blow
It's only a mind game
It's only rock and roll
It's only allegiance
It's only heart and soul
Just tell me a lie now
Just tell me you can't let go

It's only illusions
It's only illusions

My mind is at war
I lie awake in bed
Like a splinter in my hand
Like a splinter in my head
The promises we swore
And every word you've said
Like a splinter in my hand
Like a splinter in my head

Don't worry, Pedro
Don't tell me, I think I know
'Cause I'm on the payroll
The cursed kaleidoscope
Am I the pollution?
Am I the foregone conclusion?

It's only illusions
It's only illusions

My mind is at war
I lie awake in bed
Like a splinter in my hand
Like a splinter in my head
The promises we swore
And every word you've said
Like a splinter in my hand
Like a splinter in my head

It's only illusions
It's only illusions
It's only illusions
It's only de-evolution
Who can take these broken splinters from my head?

My mind is at war
I lie awake in bed
Like a splinter in my hand
Like a splinter in my head
The promises we swore
And every word you've said
Like a splinter in my hand
Like a splinter in my head

It's only illusion
It's only illusion
In all this confusion
I start to forget what I'm doing
It's only a splinter in my head
It's only a splinter in my head
It's only illusion"
