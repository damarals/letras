"x"
"1" "Even Though
Take 6

Even though you tend to stumble and fall
No one to turn to and no one to call
Let Me show you how it can be

If the mountain to get over seems so high to climb
The second hand keeps ticking you're running out of time
Let Me show you how it can be

You know that I am The One
Who makes the sun shine through again

Chorus:
Even though you're alone surely I have heard you sing your song
Even though the pain has not yet ended let it go
Even though your heart is still aching just know I'm right beside you
You don't have to face it on your own
Even though

I have seen you so many times before
Ashamed of how you're living your head hanging low
Let Me show you how it can be
Put your weight on My shoulders
I'll carry the load
I'm willing and able through the highs and the lows
Let Me show you how it can be

You know that I'm the One
Who makes the sun shine through again

Chorus

Give Me your every care and need and worry
Talking full surrender call Me I'll hear you
So much to give you

Let it go
Even though your heart is still aching
Just know I'm right beside you
You don't have to face it on your own

Chorus"
