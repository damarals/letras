"1" "Thou Art Holy
Michael W. Smith

You are holy (you are holy)
Powerful (powerful)
You are worthy (you are worthy)
Of worship (de worship)
I follow you (I follow you)
I praise you (I praise you)

Forever (forever)
I will love you (love you)
I sing and praise
(You are the lord, you are the king of kings)
The king who is worthy
(He is the father of mighty God love)

I sing and I love
(You're emanuel, you are the great I am)
I prostrate before him
(He is the lamb that saved me)
And I sing and praise
(Him live this he resurfaced)

The king who is worthy
(Always reigned he ever existed)
I sing and I love
(He is the alpha and
Omega the initiated and the end)
I prostrate before him
(Savior and messiah, friend to me)
Prince of peace only for him I will live"
