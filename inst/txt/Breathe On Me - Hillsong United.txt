Hillsong United

Breathe on me
Breath of God
Love and life that makes me free
Breathe on me Breath of God
Fan the flame within me.

Teach my heart
Heal my soul
Speak the mind that in Christ we know
Take me to your santuary
Breathe on me.

Speak to me
Voice of God
Soft and still inside my heart
Speak to me
Word of God
Comfort, heal, restore with love."
