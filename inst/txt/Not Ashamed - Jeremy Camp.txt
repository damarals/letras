"1" "Not Ashamed
Jeremy Camp

You are the fullness of the beauty I seek
You are, You are
You are the Healer of the broken and weak
You are, You are

Even though few may stand and proclaim
Your great name
It's the life I want to live
I'm convinced
There is none like You

CHORUS:
I'm not ashamed of the gospel
I'm not ashamed of Jesus Christ
I will stand and boldly say
\"This is my life\"
Whoa...

You are the Author of salvation and faith
You are, You are
You are the victory that conqured the grave
You are, You are

Even though few may stand and proclaim
Your great name
It's the life I want to live
I'm convinced
There is none like You

CHORUS
