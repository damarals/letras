"1" "Ordinary World
Red

Came in from a rainy thursday
On the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly

I turned on the lights, the tv
And the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
\"pride will tear us both apart\"
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some say
Where is the world that I recognize?
Gone away

And I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Everyone, everyone
Somehow I have to find"
