"1" "There She Stands
Michael W. Smith

When the night Seems to say
All hope is lost
Gone Away
But I Know
I'm not alone
By the light
She stands
These she waves
faithful friend
shimmering stars
westward wind
Show the way
Carry me
To he place
She stands
Just when you think it might be over
Just when you think the fight is gone
Someone will risk his life to raise her
There She stands
There she flies
clear blue sky
reminds us with red
of those that died
washed in white
by the brave
in their strength
She stands
When evil calls itself a martyr
when all your hopes come crashing down
Someone will pull her from the rubble
there she stands
We've seen her flying torn and tatered
We've seen her stand the test of time
And Through it all the folls have fallen
There She stands
By the dawn's
Early light
And Through the fight
She Stands"
