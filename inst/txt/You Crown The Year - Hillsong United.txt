"1" "You Crown The Year
Hillsong United

Verse
You crown the year with your goodness
You answer us with awesome deeds
Your hope resounds god our saviour
To distant lands and farthest seas

O paint the fields bright and golden
Drench the harvest with your rain
God's river filled with living water
That flows to all as you ordained

Chorus
Praise the name of the lord
O my soul sing his worth
All of life join the song
Come and lift up our king

Verse
Now let the earth join the dancing
Deck her out in showers of spring
The dusk and dawn forever relay
The call to come and worship him

Bridge
Holy holy
Worthy are you lord
All the glory
To your name forever"
