"1" "The Lord's Prayer (Deliver Us)
Selah

Our Father in heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven

For Thine is the kingdom
Thine is the power
And the glory forever
Forever, amen

Give us, Lord give us
This day our daily bread
And forgive us, forgive us, Lord
Forgive us of our debt

For Thine is the kingdom
Thine is the power
And the glory forever
Forever, amen, amen

Lead us from temptation
Lead us from temptation
But deliver us, deliver us
From evil to Thy salvation

For Thine is the kingdom
Thine is the power
And the glory forever
Amen

Thine is the kingdom
Thine is the power
And the glory forever
Forever amen, amen"
