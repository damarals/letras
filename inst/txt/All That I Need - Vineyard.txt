"1" "All That I Need
Vineyard

If I flew on morning’s wings
Or sailed across oceans so deep

You would still be by my side
For You’ve promised never to leave

Every mountain I face, every step of this race
I have nothing to fear, for Jesus You are here

All that I need to know for tomorrow
All that I nedd to know for today

Is that You’ll be with me each moment
Holding me close to You every step of the way

You’re the shepherd of my soul
Who faithfully guards and protects

Your word lights the way ahead
Lovingly guiding my steps

Every mountain I face, every step of this race
I have nothing to fear, for Jesus You are here"
