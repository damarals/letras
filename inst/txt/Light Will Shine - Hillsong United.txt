Hillsong United

Salvation rise
As we sing of Your freedom
We leave the past behind
As we look to Your kingdom

You bridge the great divide
Between our hearts and Your glory
Our shame dissolved
In the depths of Your mercy

We are devoted
We are devoted to You

CHORUS
Your light will shine in the darkness
Your light will shine in the dark
In the dark
Woah
We are Yours

We fill the open skies
With the sound of Your praises
Our future lives in the hope of our Saviour

It?s Your love
Your love
Woah woah
It?s Your love
Your love
Woah woah"
