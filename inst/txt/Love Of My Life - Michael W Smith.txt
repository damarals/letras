"x"
"1" "Love Of My Life
Michael W. Smith

I am amazed
When I look at you
I see you smiling back at me
It's like all my dreams come true

I am afraid
If I lost you girl
I'd fall through the cracks
And lose my track in this crazy lonely world

Sometimes it's so hard to believe
When the nights can be so long
And faith give me the strength
And kept me going on

Chorus:
You are the love of my life
And I'm so glad you found me
You are the love of my life
Baby put your arms around me
I guess this is how it feels
When you finally find something real
My angel in the night
You are the love
The love of my life

Now here you are with midnight closing in
You take my hands as our shadows dance
With moonlight on you skin
I look in your eyes
I'm lost inside your kiss
I think if I'd never met you
About all the things I'd missed

Sometimes it's so hard to believe
When a love can be so strong
And a faith gave me strength and kept me holding on"
