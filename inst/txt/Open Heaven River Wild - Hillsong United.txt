Hillsong United

[Verse 1:]
Signs and wonders from above
When You pour out Your Spirit
On the old and young
In the power of Your presence

[Pre-Chorus:]
Holy Spirit rain
Falling like a flood
Break upon my praise
As I sing of Your love
Holy Spirit fire
Burn within my soul
As I call on Your Name
As I call on Your Name
Jesus

[Verse 2:]
Dreams and visions of the Son
As we stand in Your presence
Revelations of Your love
As we look to the heavens

[Chorus:]
Oh Holy Spirit
Burn like a fire
All consuming, consume me
Here in Your presence
Lord I surrender to Your glory
For Your glory

[Bridge:]
Living water
River wild in me
Immerse me in Your mercy
Open heaven
Crashing over me
Restore me in Your glory"
