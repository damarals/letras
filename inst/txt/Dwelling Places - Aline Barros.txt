"1" "Dwelling Places
Aline Barros

Lovely are your dwelling places
Thirsty, I come after you
Jesus my joy, my reward
Your love's restoring my soul
Now I'm yours and you are mine
And from my heart a song will rise

I love you, I love you, I love you
And my heart will follow wholly after you

Jesus there's none beside you
Righteous, ruler of the earth
Nations will come and bow down
Name over all names I sing you praises
And all that I can say to you is"
