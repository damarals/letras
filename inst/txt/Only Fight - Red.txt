Red

Fell inside the words you used to say
Tried to stop myself
You know, some things don't change
Yeah, you made me what you wanted me to be
So here I am, don't look away from me

Before you turn and run away
You can't forget the price I paid
You can try to lie and hold the truth
But it always comes if I want it to

Fight, only fight
Fight, only fight

I can't let go of violence
You are the reason why
I only wanted silence
And not this war in

side, only fight
Fight, only fight

Fight
What I do, what I do, what I
Only fight
What I do, what I do, what I
Fight
What I do, what I do, what I
Only fight
What I do

What do I do?
I do what I do
What do I do?
I do what I do

Fight, only fight
Fight, only fight

Fight
What I do, what I do, what I
Only fight
What I do, what I do, what I
Fight
What I do, what I do, what I
Only fight
What I do

Fight
What I do, what I do, what I
Only fight
What I do, what I do, what I
Fight
What I do, what I do, what I
Only fight
What I do"
