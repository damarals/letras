"1" "Army Of Light
Vineyard

Let us wake from our slumber
For salvation is near
It is nearer than when we first believed
Let us love one another
Do our neighbor no harm
For the Lord of Glory will soon be here
Yes the Lord of Glory will soon be here

Help us love one another
Learn to bless and not curse
Choose humility instead of foolish pride
Can you try to imagine what it would be like
If the church world over was unified
If the church world over was unified

We're marching together hand in hand
Every woman ,child, and man
We are marching as one against the night
With Jesus as our captian
We are an army of light

Oh, I can see a new day dawning
Declaring the end of the night
So let's put aside all darkness
And put on the armour of light"
