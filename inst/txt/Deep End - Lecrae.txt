Right now (Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now)

I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
Give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to

Uh, stay on point, I've been tryna save my voice
But y'all gave me no choice
The world gone mad, can't ignore this noise
Look at these people found dead in the streets
I got some partners that hate the police
Me, I'm just tryna hold onto my peace
'Cause I'm liable to lose it and go get the piece (Yah)
I need a reason, I need a season
Pleaded with Jesus, all of this grievin'
They be like, \"F you and what you believe in\"
I do not trip, I keep it G
What in the H you sayin' to I? (I)
Ain't no Jk when I'm talkin' to God (God)
Don't need a reason to open my eyes
If I'm still breathin', I'm runnin' for Ahmaud, man (Runnin' for Ahmaud)

Uh, yeah, I've been doin' better than I was before
I walk with a limp 'cause I've been wrestlin' with the Holy Ghost (Ghost)
Deep end of this pit, but still somehow I keep on floating on
Thought I lost my grip, but God reminded me He's holding on

I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
Give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
Give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to

Yeah, I might go crazy
I might go Mj back in the 80s
Back in the 90s, I might go off
Or they better not try me, it might get dicey
I ain't tryna go back to the old me (Nah)
I'm tryna hang on like my mama told me
Sometimes legs get weak and your arms give out
And you sink to the bottom slowly (Sink to the bottom slow)
A grown man wishing that somebody hold me (Hold)
Never knew my daddy, so nobody show me
Taught me how to walk through the storm when your heart feel heavy
And it's hard and you're feeling lonely
But lowkey, high priest got the keys to the kingdom
High key low enough to bring 'em
And I need all of what He's bringing
I might go off the deep end, I just need another reason, yeah

Uh, yeah, I've been doin' better than I was before (Woo)
I walk with a limp 'cause I've been wrestlin' with the Holy Ghost (Ghost)
Deep end of this pit, but still somehow I keep on floating on
Thought I lost my grip, but God reminded me He's holding on

I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
Give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
Give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to"
