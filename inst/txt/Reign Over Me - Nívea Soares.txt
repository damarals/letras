"1" "Reign Over Me
NÃ­vea Soares

I'm running to you, my Lord
My soul yearns for you
I'm poor, blind and naked
With nothing to offer you
I surrender in your arms, oh God
For I know you take me as I am
I am here to buy your gold
Purify my heart, oh Lord

Reign over me
I surrender to you
I surrender to you
Reign over me
My beloved
I wait and I long for you"
