Third Day

I always knew there was something much better
Than what I had and what I had been told
And now one day I heard a message spoken,
Forever in my heart the words I hold

The Healer said there is only one River
The River of Life, filled with Faith and Love
It's flowing from the sacrifice of Jesus, and
Brings us all into the Kingdom of God.

Chorus:
So I'm going down, to drown myself today
Nothin' left to live for, nothin' in my way

Hold me underwater, take me even farther
Drown me down by the river today
Will you make me a believer?
Take me by my hand, hold me as I'm falling in,
Let the river wash my sins away
Yeah

So here I am at the edge of the water
That seperates me from my death and life
and still I come here with unanswered questions
