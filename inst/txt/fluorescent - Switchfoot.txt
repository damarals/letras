Switchfoot

One, two, three and

I am the moth beating his wings against the dusty window
Outside of your dull, fluorescent light
Youth was dark with the simple things
You had your light, I had my wings
You were the brightest star in the black night
My fluorescent girl in the city light

How long, my fluorescent favorite?
How long 'til you are mine?
Today, tonight? Today, tonight?
How long, my fluorescent light?

The spiders, and the ants, and the dance goes
Two by two into arcs of oblivion (Ha)
Ours is a desperate song
\"You're not that bright, I'm not that strong\"
And our outcome looks exceedingly clear
We are always separate, always near

How long, my fluorescent favorite?
How long 'til you are mine?
Today, tonight? Today, tonight?
How long, my fluorescent light, oh-oh-oh?
How long, my fluorescent favorite?
How long 'til you run out of light?
A year, a month, a day, a night?
How long, my fluorescent light?

When you lead me on
With your pseudo sun
Your light might not be all that bright
But in the dark, it feels so strong
And my wings can't last this long

You were the brightest star in the black night
My fluorescent girl in the city light

How long, my fluorescent favorite? (Ah-ah)
How long 'til you are mine? (Ah-ah)
Today, tonight? Today, tonight? (Ah-ah)
How long, my fluorescent light, oh-oh-oh? (Ah-ah)
How long, my fluorescent favorite? (Ah-ah)
How long 'til you run out of light? (Ah-ah)
A year, a month, a day, a night? (Ah-ah)
How long, my fluorescent light? (Ah-ah)"
