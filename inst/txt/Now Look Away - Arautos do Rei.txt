"1" "Now Look Away
Arautos do Rei

when i get to heaven goin' to sing and shout,
there's nobody there to turn me out
when i get to heaven goin' to put on my shoes,
goin' to walk around and tell good news.

now look away to heaven
oh, yes i hope i join the band

satan like a snake lyin'in the grass,
always waitin'in those christians' paths,
satan is a liar and a conjuror too,
if you don't watch out, he'll conjur you!

when i get to heaven going' to sing and shout,
there's nobody there to turn me out,
when a get to heaven goin' to put on my wings,
fly all over heaven while the joybell rings!"
