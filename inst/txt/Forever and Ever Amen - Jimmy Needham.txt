"x"
"1" "Forever and Ever Amen
Jimmy Needham

I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya
You may think that I'm talking foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you always will be

See you're not just time that I'm killing
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live, this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die
Oh, baby I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, amen
As long as old men sit n' talk
About the weather

As long as old women sit and talk
About old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen
I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya

They say that time takes it's toll on the body
Makes a young girl's brown hair turn gray
But, honey, I don't care
I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well
I'd love you anyway

They say time can play tricks
On the memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well it's easy to see, it's happening to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you
Darlin, I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, amen
As long as old men sit and talk
About the weather

As long as old women sit and talk
About old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
Just listen to how this song ends
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen
I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya"
