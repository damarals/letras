"1" "Rise Against
P.O.D.

What's the point in knowing
What's the use on going on
If all you do is nothing

what is it you're showing
to all the people lookin' on
leaving us with nothing
just a voice with no sound
what's holding you down?

Rise against... rise up for what is right
Stand alone... stand alone
Are you willing to try?
Rise against... and stand up for what is right
When man alone, man alone
Are you willing to die?

what's the point in living
what's the use in moving on
if you keep pretending
like there's nothing wrong

what is it you giving
to all of us who wait and hope
for someone we can follow
if you'll lead I'll go
but only you know

Rise against... rise up for what is right
Stand alone... stand alone
Are you willing to try?
Rise against... and stand up for what is right
When man alone, man alone
Are you willing to die?

what's the point in knowing
if all you do is nothing
what's the point in living
if you keep pretending
if you'll lead I'll go
but only you know

Rise against... rise up for what is right
Stand alone... stand alone
Are you willing to try?
Rise against... and stand up for what is right
When man alone, man alone
Are you willing to die?"
