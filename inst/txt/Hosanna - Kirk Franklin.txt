"x"
"1" "Hosanna
Kirk Franklin

The angels bow down at the thought of You
The darkness gives way to the light for You
The price that you paid gives us life brand New
Hosanna forever we worship You

For you are the joy that my soul longs for
The lamb that was slain for my sins and the One I adore
King of kings, Ruler of everything
Hosanna forever we worship You

[Bridge]
For your patience and kindness
And favor and mercy
And honor and glory
Because you are worthy
We can't live without You
We can't breath without You
We can't sing without You
Hosanna Hosanna

No greater love in this world but You
No one can compare to the things You do
Whenever You go I will follow You
Hosanna forever we worship You

Someday every tongue shall confess Your name
This house made of clay soon shall pass away
And whatever the test You will bring us through
Hosanna forever we worship You

[Vamp]
Hosanna forever
Hosanna forever and ever and ever
Hosanna
We praise You
Hosanna forever and ever and ever"
