Gaither Vocal Band

Brother, let me tell you
Tell you how I feel
Tell you 'bout a feeling
Feeling that is real
Brother, let me tell you how the glory rolls
Tell you how it bubbles in my happy soul
Happiness is free, it's never bought or sold
Let me tell you how I feel, let me tell you
Hey

There's a happy rhythm keeps a rockin' and a-rollin
I can feel it movin' when I sing this song
What a joy to feel it movin' on and never stoppin'
Deep within my heart it keeps a rollin' and a-rockin'
Rollin' and a-rockin' and a-rockin' and a rollin'
It's a happy rhythm in my soul
Do-do-do-do-doo

Ba-bum-bum-bum
There's music ringing deep within my soul
I can feel it bubble
I can feel it roll
Then I get the feelin' that I wanna shout
Makes me feel so good I've got to move about
Brother, there could never be a single doubt
I can feel it I can feel happy rhythm
Well
Ba-bum-bum-bum

There's a happy rhythm keeps a rockin' and a-rollin
I can feel it movin' when I sing this song
What a joy to feel it movin' on and never stoppin'
Deep within my heart it keeps a rollin' and a-rockin'
Rollin' and a-rockin' and a-rockin' and a rollin'
It's a happy rhythm in my soul
In my soul"
