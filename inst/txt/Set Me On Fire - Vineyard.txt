"1" "Set Me On Fire
Vineyard

I am so tired of compromising
I am so tired of lukewarm living
So here I am with arms wide open
Lord here I am, my heart wide open

Set me on fire
Set me on fire
Set me on fire
Set me on fire

Take this heart of mine
Place your love inside
I want to go against the grain
I want to go against the grain"
