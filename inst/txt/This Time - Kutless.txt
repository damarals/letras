Kutless

I see you standing there
I see a tear in your eye
Why you turn away
Why use you run
Run til this point of breaking

No walking away
No walking away

You were the one
That I looked to
I never thought
I'll see you run

I never thought I'll see you
Turn your back on
All you knew was right
You turned your back on God

No walking away
No walking away
No walking away
This time
No walking away

I see you're back again
You'll never run again
This time
No walking away
No walking away"
