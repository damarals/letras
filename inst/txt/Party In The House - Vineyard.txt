"1" "Party In The House
Vineyard

There's a party in the house of God
And you can come along
The Father has invited you
And this can be your song
Our God is so good
Let's have a party in the house of God

Come on everybody
It's time to party
It's time to celebrate
So let's not hesitate
All of God's children
Let's have a party in the house of God

Raise the roof shake the rafters
With dancing and laughter
Our Lord and risen King
Has won the victory
We've got the good news
Let's have a party in the house of God

There's joy and freedom
When a sinner is forgiven
If the Son has set you free
Then you are truly free
Stand up and praise Him
Let's have a party in the house of God

There's a party in the house of God
And you can come along
The Father has invited you
And this can be your song
Let's have a good time
Let's have a party in the house of God

(BRIDGE)
Party in the house
Party in the house
Move your feet
Swing to the beat
Party in the house
Our God is so good
Let's have a party in the house of God"
