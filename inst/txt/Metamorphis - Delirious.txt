Delirious

Hello friend, it's been sometime
Since I've sat at your table, and drank your wine
Worldly lies, empty skies
But only you can satisfy

Can I be somebody? Not what they want me to be
Just a pale reflection of what you want me to be

Sticks and stones, skin and bones
My teflon coat is wearing thin
Worldly wise, synthesised
I'm on the outside looking in

Can I be somebody? Not what they want me to be
Just a pale reflection of what you want me to be
That's what I'm gonna be
Can I be somebody? Can I be somebody?
I'm gonna be somebody

I know one day, I will be free
My cynical clothing, will fall from me
Flying high in the blink of an eye
Mezzamorphisy"
