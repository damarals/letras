"x"
"1" "In Your Grace
Kirk Franklin

How could someone like you, love someone like me
Full of mistakes and insecurity,
When you look in my heart, tell me what do you see,
That makes you love me so?
Is it the nails that pierced in your side?
Or the moment you dropped your head and you died,
For a sinner like me, you gave up your life;
It's time to let you know

Lord I, surrender
And I give you all I have
It's not much but I hear you, calling
So hear I am, standing in Your Grace

(Small talk By Kirk)

Lord I, surrender
And I give you, all i have
It's not much but I hear you, calling
So hear I am, standing in Your Grace"
