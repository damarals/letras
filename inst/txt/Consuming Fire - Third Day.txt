Third Day

Set this place on fire
Send you spirit, Savior
Rescue from the mire
Show Your servant favor

Yesterday was the day that I was alone
Now I'm in the presence of Almighty God

Chorus:
and yes our God, He is a consuming fire
And the flames burn down deep in my soul
Yes our God He is a consuming fire
He reaches inside and He melts down this cold heart of stone.

Set this place on fire
Send Your spirit, Saviour
Rescue from the mire
Show your servant favor

Yesterday was the day that I was alone
Now I'm in the presence of Almighty God

and yes our God, He is a consuming fire
And the flames burn down deep in my soul
Yes our God He is a consuming fire
He reaches inside and He melts down this cold heart of stone.

Did you realize that inside you there is a flame?
Did you ever try to let it burn?"
