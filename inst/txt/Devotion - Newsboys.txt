All my world
All I've lost
The wrecks I've made here
The lives it cost
Your Hand re_stores
Your Words make Whole
With all my soul
I thank You I owe You

-Chorus-
All my Devotion
All that I have to give
Here's my Devotion
You're all that it means to live

All my past
My tainted name
You stole it's legacy
of pride and shame
You're all I Love
You're all I Fear
I'm drawing near
to face you
to know you
to show you

-Chorus-

-Bridge-
You found me
in a shallow grave
You dregged (called) me
out from beneath it all
You healed (touched) me, saved me, in the nick of time
Your perfect time"
