"1" "Falling To Pieces
Third Day

This feeling in my heart
is tearing me apart
No matter what I do
I can’t run away from You

You’ve given and I’ve taken
I’m asking once again

My life is falling to pieces
Living my own way
My world is spinning in circles
So today your will be done

I’m walking on the edge
And trying to forget
the promises I’ve made
and the sacrifice you paid
You’ve given and I’ve taken
but I’m asking once again"
