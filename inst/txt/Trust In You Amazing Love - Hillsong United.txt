"1" "Trust In You (Amazing Love)
Hillsong United

You have always been
You will always be faithful
When I cry out to You God
And my heart is overwhelmed, You hear

And I know I can trust You at all times
Cause the One who is higher
Stands by my side

You hide me God in the shadow of Your wings
And draw me close
I'm secure in Your holy embrace
I will trust in You

God You Are the One
Who is steadfast strong and true
Always, always"
