"x"
"1" "I Got A Feeling
Third Day

I got a message
I got a song
Can I get a witness
Tell me what’s going on

I’ll show the people
A better way
Maybe I will tomorrow
Maybe I will today


‘Cause I got a feeling it won’t be long
Maybe I’m right, maybe I’m wrong
But I know one thing for sure
Only time will tell it
I got a feeling coming over me
Nothing else here can set me free
But I know one thing for sure
Well, I’ve got to show it



I got a mission
I got a sign
Is anybody listening
I gotta make sure this time
I’ll tell the people
What’s on my mind
Maybe I will tomorrow
Maybe I will tonight

I got a message
I got a song
Everybody help me sing along"
