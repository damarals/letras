"1" "Moments Like These
Selah

There?s a five year old smiling ar me
In a mermaid dress and no front teeth
Got her mom?s high heels on
Chocolate on her face
Dancing around like she owns the place

She makes me smile but it makes me sad
To know I can?t get these moments back
My oldest child she likes the rules
Yeah, boundary lines make her feel secure
She?s eight years old going on nineteen

Taking care of her sister and her mom and me
She makes me smile but it makes me sad
To know I can?t get these moments back
So I?m down on my knees help me soak it all in
I want all of this life that you?ll let me live
And when time flies by

?Cause my heaven on earth are moments like these
My middle child that I?m so proud of
Crawls in my lap for a squeeze hug
She likes dressing up and she loves ballet
When she talks to God I learn how to pray
She makes me smile but it makes me sad

To know I can?t get these moments back
So I?m down on my knees help me soak it all in
I want all of this life that you?ll let me live
And when time flies by
Oh, remind me to breathe
?Cause by heaven on earth are moments like these

I?ve got a little girl in heaven like now
Those streets of gold are her playground
The two hours she lived was enough to fall in love
She?s the sweetest thing I ever let go of
So I?m down on my knees help me soak it all in

I want all of this life that you?ll let me live
And when time flies by
Lord, remind me to breathe
?Cause my heaven on earth are moments like these
I?m down on my knees help me soak it all in

I want all of this life that you?ll let me live
When time flies by remind me to breathe
?Cause my heaven on earth are moments like these
My heaven on earth are moments like these"
