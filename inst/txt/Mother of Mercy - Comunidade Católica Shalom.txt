Comunidade Cat√≥lica Shalom

Oh, Mother of mercy
Our live, our sweetness, our hope
Sinners and poor find comfort in you
Pray for us

Oh, mother of tenderness
You always love and weep with those who weep
You welcome the afflicted who's seeking peace
Pray for us

Whoever finds their place
Under your mantle
Even in their midst of tears
They will find heaven on this Earth

In your embrace, there's peace
In your gaze, there is love
You're the most graceful Hymn
You are a shelter
A hidden place for us
In your embrace, there's peace
In your gaze, there is love
You're the most graceful Hymn
You are a shelter
A hidden place for us

Oh, Mary, Oh Mary
Oh, Mary, we are yours
Oh, Mary, Oh Mary
Oh, Mary, we are yours
In your embrace, there's peace
In your gaze, there is love
You're the most graceful Hymn
You are a shelter
A hidden place for us
In your embrace, there's peace
In your gaze, there is love
You're the most graceful Hymn
You are a shelter
A hidden place for us"
