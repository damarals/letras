"1" "Rumor Mill
Gaither Vocal Band

Let me tell you a story about a local enterprise
There's one in every town, no matter what its size
It doesn't turn a profit, or bring in any revenue
It's good for one thing and that's the damage it'll do
It's called...
Chorus:
The rumor mill
Oh yeah, the rumor mill
If it can be twisted, you can be sure that it will
'Cause there ain't nothing sacred, none at all
At the rumor mill, the rumor mill
The people that work there are all volunteers
The only qualification is a mouth and two big ears
If the story's not clear enough, well that's ok
They'll just doctor it up and then send it on its way
It doesn't matter who's involved or who it is gonna hurt
As long as folks are listening they'll keep shovlin' dirt at
Repeat Chorus
The rumor mill, manufacturing lies
The rumor mill, where the truth is disguised
The rumor mill, where reputations are crushed
The rumor mill, and where nothing is hushed
If it can be twisted, you can be sure that it will
'Cause there ain't nothing sacred, none at all
At the rumor mill, oh yeah, the rumor mill
Now you listen my children to this warning I make
You've got a lot to lose, there's a lot here at stake
The Bible plainly states \"You're gonna reap what you sow\"
And \"You'll be shown mercy by the mercy you show\"
So shut your mouth and ask your friends to kindly do the same (So shut your mouth and ask your friends to kindly do the same)
Or you'll wind up a victim with no one else to blame
Repeat Chorus
Oh yeah, the rumor mill (x3)
At the rumor mill"
