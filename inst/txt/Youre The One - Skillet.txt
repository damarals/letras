"1" "You're The One
Skillet

You love me like no other
You have been the Savior of my life
You know my weakness
You see me beautiful - through your eyes....

(Chorus:)
And you're the one that I need,
The one who makes me complete.
And you're the one who is strong,
when I am crying and weak.
And you're the one that I love,
the one who never gives up.
And you're the one that I - need
you're the one
you're the one

You love me like no other,
You make it easy for my heart to believe.
And when I'm drowning,
You're all the way to rescue me.....

(Chorus)

I carry all without knowing ow,
I never need as I'm needing now...

He loves me like no other...
You're the one

(Chorus)"
