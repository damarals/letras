"1" "The Breaker's Encounter
For Today

As I was thinking back,
Back to a day where it was mid-day but the sky was black like midnight
Seeing a lifeless body impaled by nails suffering at the blast of hell
Caught my attention cause it looked like a blood bath as I looked past and saw a broken man
Soaked in the white hot wrath of God and I asked why
I found some answers in His bloody face
A face I began to recognize in the background of every instance of my life, I ignored
Suddenly sense these spirits flooding, soothing my rude, rude soul
Though ruined by the world’s view, He wooed me
Though crude and without a clue and screwed up out of my mind
He pursued me ‘til He made me holy,
Whole."
