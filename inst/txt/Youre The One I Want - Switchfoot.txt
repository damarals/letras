"1" "You're The One I Want
Switchfoot

There are countless stars in the sky tonight
And the city glows with a million lights
But of all this bright that I see tonight
You're the one I want

There are countless mountains left to climb
With these butterflies I still feel inside
But it's just us here in the candlelight
And You're the one I want

There are countless memories lost, forgotten, thrown into the wind
There are countless words I wish I never said
There are countless explorations that I'm longing to begin
But you're the one I want
You're the one I want

There are countless souls wide awake tonight
With the countless questions on my mind
And a million clocks that I can't unwind
But You're the one I want"
