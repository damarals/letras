"1" "More Than Enough
Newsboys

Child of promise sent from heaven
Light from light shine down on us
Hope to fill a hungry people
Child of promise, child of god

You are faithful, you are savior
You are more than enough
You are healer, you are holy
You are more than enough

Man of sorrows, heart of mercy
Love raised high upon a cross
Death to lead us to redemption
Man of sorrows, son of god

Lord of life in glory risen
Love has conquered both sin and grave
Heaven's gates are swinging open
Lord of life, king of kings

I'm alive in the arms of love
I lift my hands to the god above"
