"1" "He Touched Me
Gaither Vocal Band

Shackled by a heavy burden
'Neath a load of guilt and shame
Then the hand of Jesus touched me
And now I'm no longer the same

He touched me, oh, He touched me
And oh, the joy, that floods my soul
Something happened, and now I know
He touched me, and made me whole

Since I met this blessed Savior
Since He's cleansed and made me whole
I'll never cease to praise Him (to praise Him)
I'll shout it while eternity rolls

Oh, He touched me, oh, He touched me, He touched me
And oh, the joy, that floods my soul
Something happened, and now I know
He touched me, and made me whole"
