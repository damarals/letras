"1" "Let Me Love You
Third Day

Ever since the world around you shattered
You`ve been looking everywhere for something more
Sometimes you feel like your life doesn`t matter
But it does
I tell you it does

Come on let me love you now
Come on let me love you and hold you through the
storms
I will keep you safe and warm
Come on let me love you now
Come on let me love you and kiss away your tears
I will always be here
Come on let me love you

Yesterday you found your heart was broken
Tomorrow doesn`t leave much room for hope
Today you`ll find that my arms are wide open
And my heart
My heart is full of love

Give up on all the other things
`Cause my love can bring you more
And if you take a chance on me
I`ll give you what you`re looking for"
