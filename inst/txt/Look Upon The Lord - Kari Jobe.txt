Kari Jobe

Verse 1
Look upon the Lord
Stand in awe of His beauty
Look upon the Lord
Seated high He is holy

Pre-Chorus
Let the glory of our God
From heaven come down
Let the house of the Lord
Be filled with the cloud

Chorus
You are good and Your mercy will endure
You are good and forever we are Yours
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

Verse 2
Listen for the Lord
Hear the voice of His Spirit
Call upon His name
He is near He is with us

Tag
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

Bridge
Holy, Holy
with one voice
Heaven and Earth are singing
Holy, Holy
Lord God, Almighty"
