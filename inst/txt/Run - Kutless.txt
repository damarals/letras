Why do you run why do you hide oh don't you know i
just, just want to be with you

Looking down from above as you watch TV
Wondering why, why you're ignoring me
Do you remember, remember when i came to you
And you loved me
And i'm waiting for you,
And i'm waiting for you

Why do you run why do you hide oh don't you know i
just, just wanna be with you, to be with you
Hey, why do you run why do you hide oh don't you know
I just, just wanna be with you, to be with you...

Whatever happened to the love, the love you had for me
When you first came to me
Don't you know that i died, I died so i could be with you,
forever
And i'm waiting for you,
And i'm waiting for you

Why do you run why do you hide oh don't you know i
just, just wanna be with you, to be with you
Hey, why do you run why do you hide oh don't you know
I just, just wanna be with you, to be with you...

Find a place of solitude, and i'll speak to you
As you pray to me
Don't you know i'm waiting here, waiting for you to
read and hear my words
I'm waiting here missing the time the times we shared
oh, please come to me

Why do you run why do you hide oh don't you know i
just, just wanna be with you, to be with you
Hey, why do you run why do you hide oh don't you know
I just, just wanna be with you, to be with you...
Hey, to be with you..
