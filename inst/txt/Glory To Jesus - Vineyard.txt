Vineyard

Majesty and splendor
Yours and Yours alone
Rightousness and justice
The foundation of Your throne
And we come before You
To give honor to Your name

Glory to Jesus, glory to Jesus
Jesus our God, Jesus our Savior
Jesus our King, to Jesus

You are our God, You are our Savior
You are our King, Jesus"
