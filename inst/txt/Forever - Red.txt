"x"
"1" "Forever
Red

I try to run, I try to hide
From a voice that couldn't satisfy
That was me, always needing more
And letting go of all I had before
'Cause it feels like the end
A wound that I can't mend
I just can't fight any longer

You waited 'til I sobered
You came when You knew that the game was over
I didn't even want to be found

[chorus]

But You chased me down and broke in
Just when I was done believing
Spun me round so close now
I can feel You breathing
Sunlight burns inside and
I feel so alive and
Help me now, tell me how
How can this last forever?
Forever

I ignored the signs
Opened every door
But I couldn't find what I searched for
I try to fight, but I turn and run
Every move I make is the wrong one
You patiently wait for my next mistake
I know it won't be much longer

You waited 'til I sobered
You came when You knew that the game was over
I didn't even want to be found

[Chorus]

But You chased me down and broke in
Just when I was done believing
Spun me round so close now
I can feel You breathing
Sunlight burns inside and
I feel so alive and
Help me now, tell me how
How can this last forever?

You gave me so much more
Than I could ever ask for
But I turned and followed
I road that left me hollow
And You still waited for me to come back home
You brought me home....

[Chorus]

But You chased me down and broke in
Just when I was done believing
Spun me round so close now
I can feel You breathing
Sunlight burns inside and
I feel so alive and
Help me now, tell me how
How can this last forever?

Forever!"
