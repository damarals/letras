"1" "Say Hello
P.O.D.

Oh, yeah, yeah, Come on!
Walked in the place, and everybody looked down at we
Disgust on their face, but we don't mind cause we're too busy smiling
Never get in my face, that's not the way to understanding
And ignorance is blind, so this time, this time we gonna let it ride

I know, that I know, that I know, that this is,
I know, that I know, that I know, that this is real
I hate to disappoint you, but this is how I feel.
And let me introduce to you myself,
Say hello to the bad guy.

Can't plead my case, the juries out won't give me a chance,
Cause I don't think the same.
Shut down the court, kidnap the judge.
Now they sit in his place,
And who are you to make your birth right deciding my fate?
I know your kind, I have, and I will carry on.

I know, that I know, that I know, that this is,
I know, that I know, that I know, that this is real
I hate to disappoint you, but this is how I feel.
And let me introduce to you myself,
Say hello to the bad guy.
We're here to make you feel better about yourself
We're here to introduce you to yourself
Say hello to the bad guy!

I hate to disappoint you, but this is how I feel.
And let me introduce to you myself,
Say hello to the bad guy.
We're here to make you feel better about yourself
We're here to introduce you to yourself
Say hello to the bad guy!"
