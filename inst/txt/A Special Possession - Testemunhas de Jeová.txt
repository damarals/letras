"1" "A Special Possession
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

God has a new creation
His spirit-anointed sons
He has bought them from mankind
His approval they've won

A special possession
They're a people for your name
They love you, they praise you
As one they declare abroad your fame

They are a holy nation
Who handle the truth aright
God has called them from darkness
To his wonderful light

A special possession
They're a people for your name
They love you, they praise you
As one they declare abroad your fame

Faithful to their commission
They gather the other sheep
To the lamb they are loyal
His commandments they keep

A special possession
They're a people for your name
They love you, they praise you
As one they declare abroad your fame"
