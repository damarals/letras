"1" "Lord Thank You For The Memories
MÃºsicas Gospel

I feel I'm wrapped in your love
On a warm summers day.
And I feel kisses from angels
That you send my way.

Its more than a feeling
This gift from God.
I feel that your'e with me
As you smile, and nod.

And I say; Lord, thank you for the memories
And all the loving care.
Thanks for friends and family
And letting them be there.

I can feel your hand
Hear your whispers in the air.
I know that you see me
I wish I was there.

It's more than just memories
As I'm sure your're aware.
The times you've stood by me
Has showed me you care.

And I say; Lord, thank you for the memories
And all the loving care.
Thanks for friends and family
And letting them be there."
