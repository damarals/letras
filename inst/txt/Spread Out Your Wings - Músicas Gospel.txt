"1" "Spread Out Your Wings
MÃºsicas Gospel

Living your life,
Is fulfilling God's will.
He's there to help you,
To climb every hill.

He's always watching,
To see what you do.
When you need help,
He'll walk along with you.

Chorus:
Spread out your wings,
Forget other things.
Enjoy living life,
And all that it brings.

You can't climb a mountain,
Until you first try.
And you won't get to heaven,
Until the day that you die.

God gave you love,
So it could be shared.
When you get to heaven,
He'll be waiting there.

Chorus:
Spread out your wings,
Forget other things.
Enjoy living life,
And all that it brings."
