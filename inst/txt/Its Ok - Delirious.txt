verse 1
Take me or leave me
dont have to believe me
all the words i have to say all the songs that fly away
take me or leave me believe me good will come

chorus
its ok you know i'll live to fight another day
its ok you know i'll live to find another way

verse 2
she's as pretty as hell and her eyes have no home
the beauty has run from your face.
beauty that hung from your face
and if oyu would drink this wine you'll shine.

its ok you know i'll live to fight another day
its ok you know i'll live to find the words to say
its ok you know i'll live to find another way
and if oyu give me holy wine i'll shine

will you come to me like a summers day. i will sing again"
