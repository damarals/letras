"1" "Circus For a Psycho
Skillet

Psycho, cho, cho,cho
Psycho, here we go!

You push me till I break
and the anger turns to rage.
Why can't you just leave me alone?
Got you finger on the trigger
you think that you're the winner
but you're gonna get kicked
off of your throne, no!(no! no!)

You think you're gonna hurt me
get ready o get dirty
you created this beast inside!
pull this noose tighter
and lift a little higher
'cause you're killing me slow
I ain't ready to die!
(killing me slow but I ain't ready to die!)

Tonight, get ready for a fight!
So now you know it's time, to ride
a circus for a psycho!
Round and round we go
lookout below 'cause I
want off this, I want off this!
Circus for a psycho!(psycho, cho, cho, cho)
Circus for a psycho!
(psycho, here we go!)(2x)

Everybody down gonna burn it to the ground
can't keep this beast inside!
Never again! Never again!
you're killing me slow, I ain't ready to die!
(killing me slow but I ain't ready to die!)

Tonight, get ready for a fight!
So now you know it's time, to ride
a circus for a psycho!
Round and round we go
lookout below 'cause I
want off this, I want off this!
Circus for a psycho!(psycho, cho, cho, cho)
Circus for a psycho!(psycho, here we go!)

You think you're gonna hurt me
get ready o get dirty
gonna burn it to the ground

Tonight, get ready for a fight!
So now you know it's time, to ride
a circus for a psycho!
Round and round we go
lookout below it's time to ride
a circus for a psycho!
Never again! Never again!
You're killing me slow but I ain't ready to die!
Round and round we go

want off this, I want off this!
Circus for a psycho!(psycho, cho, cho, cho)
Circus for a psycho!(psycho, here we go!)
Circus for a psycho!"
