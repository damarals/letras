"1" "Your Love Reaches Me (psalm 36)
Vineyard

You are the fountain of my life
And in your light I find my reason
'Cause Your love reaches to the stars
Even the great deep
(And) Your love reaches to this heart
And it makes me sing

Your love reaches me
It's what I need
It's what I need
Your love reaches me
It's what I need
It's what I need

Oh Lord, how priceless
Is your unending love
Both high and low
Find refuge in your shadow"
