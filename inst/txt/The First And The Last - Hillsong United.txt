"1" "The First And The Last
Hillsong United

(Verse 1)
You are the first and the last
Beginning and the end
The promisse of wonders to come
The future is in your hands
Caught in the light
With all the earth will sing

(Verse 2)
You are the author of Love
Our freedom within Your Name
Embracing the cross meant for us
And bought us to life again
Caught in the Love
With all we are let us sing

(Chorus)
God our hope and our salvation
Worthy of all the praise
Be our light
Everlasting
Great is Your name
Jesus the First and the last

(Verse 3)
Show us the way of Your Love
Lead us toward the truth
Stir up the fire in us
To live out this life for You
Caught in Your Name
Jesus forever we'll sing

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Every Heart and every nation will hear the sound
As Your light breaks through the darkness
And Your Name rings out
Every distant horizon will meet as one
Singing holy is Your name
We sing Holy is Your name

(Chorus)

You are the first and the last
You are the Alfa and Omega
The beggining and the end
Our salvation
You bring freedom
God Your grace knows nowhere
You are the name above all names
Forever now I'll stand
You are the first and the last
You are the first and the last"
