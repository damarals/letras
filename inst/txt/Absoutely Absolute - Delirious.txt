"1" "Absoutely Absolute
Delirious

Waiting for the sun to shine
In the twilight of our youth
A time when I'll be yours and you will be mine
We're waiting for the sun to shine

Waiting for the age to come
When creation starts again
A time when sorrow ends and the kingdom comes
We're waiting for the age to come

Hoping, waiting, my heart's breaking
How long
Absolutely, absolute

I want to know the master plan
To breathe the esoteric air
When all will know the truth has already come
I want to know the master plan

Hoping, waiting, my heart's breaking
How long
Absolutely, absolute"
