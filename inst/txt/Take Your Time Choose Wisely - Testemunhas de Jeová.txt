"1" "Take Your Time, Choose Wisely
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

Everything was fine but I'm wondering: Who will I marry?
What I'm doing right now is deciding not to hurry
This is a choice that could either bring, laughter or sorrow
And the feelings that start in a youthful heart
They could be gone tomorrow

Take your time, patience is the key, just wait and see
Use your head, though your heart may not agree
And think: Is this the one for me? Possibly
If you just take your time
(You just take your time) and choose wisely

And I wanted someone who will care for me
And he made me feel special
But I knew in my heart this could never be successful
I wanna make sure it's Jehovah's way, let His word guide me
And I'm willing to wait just
to have a mate living the truth beside me

Take your time, patience is the key, just wait and see
Use your head, though your heart may not agree
And think: Is this the one for me? Possibly
If you just take your time
(If you just take your time) and choose wisely

And choose wisely"
