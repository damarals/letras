"1" "In The Neighborhood
Catedral

The boy who walks in the empty street
His life is a desert
The boy who walks to the precipice
Nobody care, he's alone
They don't see, him all is gone
The boy speaks about his life
What happens inside him
The boy speaks about his Wo'll
What happens around him
Nobody care, he's alone
They don't see him, all is gone

In the neighborhood
He is alone
In the neighborhood
There's some body alone"
