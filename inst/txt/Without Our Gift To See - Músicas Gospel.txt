"1" "Without Our Gift To See
MÃºsicas Gospel

When I look into a mirror,
My eyes see things so clear.
I see the tears that's cried,
And true love that has died.

If I look through my eyes,
They help me to identify.
I believe what they see,
They have never lied to me.

I have seen many things,
That makes my heart sing.
I've saw hearts that break,
A difference love can make.

Chorus:
What would our lives be?
Without our gift to see.
The world all around us,
Would escape you and me.

I know that some are blind,
Their life may seem unkind.
But God guides their ways,
As he lights up their days.

For those who are blessed,
No problem is addressed.
But what if we'd lose,
A gift that some abuse.

Chorus:
What would our lives be?
Without our gift to see.
The world all around us,
Would escape you and me."
