"1" "Tear Down The Walls
Hillsong United

Tear down the walls, see the world
Is there something we have missed
Turn from ourselves, look beyond
There is so much more than this

And I don't need to see it to believe it
I don't need to see it to believe it
Cause I can't shake this fire (burning) deep inside my heart

Look to the skies, hope arise
See His majesty revealed
More than this life
There is love, there is hope
And this is real

This life is Yours
And hope is rising
As Your glory floods our hearts
Let love tear down these walls
That all creation
Would come back to You
It's all for You

Your Name is glorious, glorious
Your love is changing us, calling us
To worship in spirit and in truth
As all creation returns to You

Oh for all the sons and daughters
Who are walking in the darkness
You are calling us to lead them back to You
We will see Your spirit rising
As the lost come out of hiding
Every heart will see this hope we have in You"
