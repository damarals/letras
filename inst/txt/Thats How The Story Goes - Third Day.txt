"1" "That's How The Story Goes
Third Day

In the beginning you created,
The heavens and the earth and everything was good,
You created man according to your perfect plan,
And everyday we walked with you in life was paradise,

Then things became more complicated,
Pride entered the picture and did what it could,
Tried to make us think that we could make it on our own,
And now we’re feeling so alone cos' we believed the lie,
Since the fateful day we turned our backs on you,
You’ve been trying to win our hearts so we’d come back to you.

That’s how the story goes
Sounds strange but its true
The world’s fallen but your love broke through
That’s how the story goes

You loved this world so much you saved it,
You came down to earth and in our place you stood,
Showed us how to live and then you paid the sacrifice,
And took our sins upon you, then you died to give us life.

Then you conquered death, but that is not the end,
I know in my heart that someday you’ll come back again.

That’s how the story goes
Sounds strange but its true
The world’s fallen but your love broke through
That’s how the story goes

And in the final chapter we all have a part to play,
We must take this story out into the world today!

That’s how the story goes
Sounds strange but its true
The world’s fallen but your love broke through
That’s how the story goes
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
That’s how the story goes"
