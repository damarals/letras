"1" "Fear Not
Chris Tomlin

Be strong, take heart
The lord he fights for us
Hold on; our God
Is a mighty warrior

God, he is faithful
Faithful to us
Through troubled waters
He won't abandon
Fear not!
The lord God is with us

Be still and rest
He holds the universe
Lift high your hands
To the rock unshakable

God, he is faithful
Faithful to us
Through troubled waters
He won't abandon
Fear not!
The lord God is with us

God, he is faithful
Through every storm
He'll never leave us
He won't abandon
Fear not!
The lord God is with us

The truth is a sword
The battle is the lord's
Surely he will deliver
So call on his name
He is mighty to save
Surely he will deliver

God, he is faithful
Faithful to us
Through troubled waters
He won't abandon
Fear not!
The lord God is with us

God, he is faithful
Through every storm
He'll never leave us
He won't abandon
Fear not!
The lord God is with us"
