"1" "Breathe On Us
Kari Jobe

There is a shaking
Let hearts awaken
Our God is moving
Forever changing us

There is a trembling
There is revival
The sound of worship
So great and glorious

Holy Spirit, hear us now

Breathe on us
Holy fire, fall
Come and fill this place with Your presence
Like a rushing wind
Send Your spirit here
Breath of heaven, breathe on us
Breath of heaven, breathe on us

There is a shaking
Let hearts awaken
Our God is moving
Forever changing us

There is a trembling
There is revival
The sound of worship
So great and glorious

Holy Spirit, hear us now

Chorus

Lift up your hands and shout
The Lord is with us now
Lift up your voice and sing
He is holy

Chorus

Come breathe on us
Come breathe on us
Come breathe on us"
