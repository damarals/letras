"1" "Changed Forever (feat. Nirva Ready)
Toby Mac

I’d heard Your name, but never seen Your face
Been touched before but never Your embrace
Had a soul to lose and the world to gain
But then You whispered my name

And I heard the truth but never from Your lips
Bought the lies of many counterfeits
Dreamed my dreams, but they were never in color
And I searched for You and many others

I was down for the count

Then I saw Your face
Just a glimpse of Your face, and my whole world changed
Then I saw Your face, and I was changed forever
Changed forever now
Then I saw Your face
One glimpse of Your face, it’s a whole new game
Then I saw Your face, and I was changed forever
Yours forever now

If I could reach the stars, I could touch the sky
And if I spread my wings, I could almost fly
I had everything paper could buy
I was lost in my disguise

And if I played my role, they would feel my style
If I bought the night they would buy my smile
I’ve been runnin’ this game for a million miles
Believin’ my own lies

I was down, I was out

I was blinded by my selfish dreams
Everything ain’t what it seems
From inside to out, there ain’t no doubt
I been changed

NOTHING SHORT OF satisfaction
Your love caused a change reaction
I can tell you this much I FELT your touch
And I’m changed

When I was down for the count, YOUR love surrounded me
Blink of an eye
I saw my destiny

Change, rearranged ‘cause I couldn’t maintain
The heart it took to even stay in the game
One look in Your eyes even I realized
A fellow like me had been put down to size
To be built up in a better way, Your way
Yahweh ain’t about to fade
Bombastic, ain’t no way to mask it
I saw Your face, and my old way’s blasted

I’m Yours forever now"
