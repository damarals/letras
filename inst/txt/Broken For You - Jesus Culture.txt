"1" "Broken For You
Jesus Culture

I'm calling out your name
Won't you come near to me
I've be missing those times we've had
So give me that passion again

And a heart of clay
That you can mold into
Into a heart that's pure
Broken for you

Come and kiss me once again
For your love is better than wine
In the secret place i've cried
Out for you

Cause i am weak but you is strong
So let me see your face oh god
Cause with one glance your eyes
My heart is broken
Broken for you

Oh i sleep but my heart is awake
Is the voice of the one that i love
He's crying will you open to me
My love my perfect one"
