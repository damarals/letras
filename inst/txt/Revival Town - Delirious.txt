"1" "Revival Town
Delirious

Well i've got a message to bring
i can't preach but i can sing
and me and my brothers here
gonna play redemption hymns
we're not on our own you know
it's all around the world
'cos this is the freedom generation
living for revival in this time

hallelujah
people everywhere are singing
hallelujah
you've turned my mourning into dancing

revival town
that's what they're calling this place now
revival town
it'll put a smile on your face now
revival town

well i've got a story to tell
about the king above all kings
you spoke for peace, hope, love and justice
things that we all need today
you let a broken generation
become a broken generation
this revival generation

you may not hear it on the radio
but you can feel it on the air
hallelujah
people everywhere are singing
hallelujah
you've turned my mourning into dancing

revival town
that's what they're calling this place now
revival town
that's what they're calling this place now
revival town."
