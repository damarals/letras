"1" "Thank God For Memories
MÃºsicas Gospel

Walking through the corridors, wandering back in time,
I found some memories that helped to ease my mind.
Buried deep in a dark corner where I tripped and fell,
I found your pictures and they rescued me from hell.

You were my first love, I was happy as I could be.
In my memory you're still pretty as you come to me.
I was feelin' down 'til your memories came around,
Thank God for memories and what he lets me see.

I never liked girls, 'til the day you changed my world.
When I was just seven I fell in love with my first girl.
I held your hand as we would tenderly share a kiss.
Looking at your picture brings back so much I miss.

You were my first love, I was happy as I could be.
In my memory you're still pretty as you come to me.
I was feelin' down 'til your memories came around,
Thank God for memories and what he lets me see.

In my memory you're still pretty as you come to me.
Thank God for memories and what he lets me see."
