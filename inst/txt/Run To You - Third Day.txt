"x"
"1" "Run To You
Third Day

I was tired of waiting
Playing all the games and
Living in a place that was not for me

So I thought it was time
For me to get what's mine
And to do it all, everything I've dreamed?

What I thought was the best for me
Turned to be
All the worst I could find

If I run to you
Will you hold me in your arms forevermore
X2

Now I got a feeling
That I gotta leave and
Find a way back to where I came from

No I don't deserve it
I know it's unheard but
Living here without you my life is gone

I confess that I shouldn't have run from you
Now I know I was wrong

If I run to you
Will you hold me in your arms forevermore
X2

Nowhere to run to
And no one to turn to
I'm dying out here on my own
Long before I even thought of return
Your arms were wide open
Waiting for me to come home
For me to come home

If I run to you
Will you hold me in your arms forevermore
X4
If I run to you, if I run to you
Will you hold me Lord"
