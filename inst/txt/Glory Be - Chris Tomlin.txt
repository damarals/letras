Chris Tomlin

There's a song that's on my lips from the moment that I rise
To the One who rescued me and brought me to life

Praise awaits You at the dawn
praise awaits You in the night
With the heavens I will sing and lift You high

Glory be to God the Father, glory be to God the Son
Glory be to God the Spirit, all glory to the One
Glory to the Lord almighty, glory to the King most high
Glory be to God forever, all glory to the One

As it was and is and ever shall be, amen, amen
As it was and is and ever shall be, amen, amen

Glory be to God
Oh, glory be to God
Oh, glory be, oh, glory be to"
