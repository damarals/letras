"1" "Enough
Jeremy Camp

You are my supply
My breathe of life
Still more awesome than I know
You are my reward
Worth living for
Still more awesome than I know

All of You
Is more than enough for all of me
For every thirst and every need
You satisfy me with Your love
And all I have in You is more than Enough

You're my sacrifice
Of greatest price
And still more awesome than I know
You're my coming King
You are everything
Still more awesome than I know

More than alll I want
More than all I need
You are more than enough for me
More than all I know
More than all I can see
You are more than enough for me"
