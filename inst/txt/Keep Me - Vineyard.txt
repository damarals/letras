Vineyard

Keep me in the narrow way
Keep me in the Jesus way
I need Your help today
Keep me in the narrow way
Keep me in the Jesus way
I need Your help today

I want to follow You
To keep my eyes on You
I want to live my life for heaven
Your everlasting truth
Is what I'm holding to
I want to follow You forever

Father I can remember when
I made a lifelong promise
To follow You all the way
But I hear so many other voices
There are so many choices
Pulling my heart away
I am tempted by
The worldly ways around me
By philosophies and powers
That surround me
Won't You lead me

I hear wisdom is calling me
Leading me on the highway
Of righteousness and peace
I feel the battle is raging on
I'm asking You to be
The captain of my will
I am tempted by
The worldly ways around me
By philosophies and powers
That surround me
Won't You lead me

Keep me in Your way
Keep me in Your way
Keep me in the Jesus way"
