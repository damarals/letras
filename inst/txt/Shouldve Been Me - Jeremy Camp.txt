"1" "Should've Been Me
Jeremy Camp

It should've been me with arms open
It should've been me that was torn
It should've been me, I was broken
It should've been me, it should've been me

Mercy, mercy heard my cry
Mercy, mercy saved my life

You carried all of my burdens
You took 'em all to that grave
I know You didn't deserve it
But You took my place
You traded hope for my hurting
You bore the weight of my shame
I know You didn't deserve it
And I know it should've been me
I can't believe it

It should've been me in the darkness
It should've been me that felt the pain
It should've been me brokenhearted
It should've been, oh, it should've been me
But I'm free

You carried all of my burdens
You took 'em all to that grave
I know You didn't deserve it
But You took my place
You traded hope for my hurting
You bore the weight of my shame
I know You didn't deserve it
And I know it should've been me
I can't believe it
I can't believe it

No longer dirty
No longer afraid
I am no captive, I am no slave
No longer guilty
No longer in chains
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, I'm free

You carried all of my burdens
You took 'em all to that grave
I know You didn't deserve it
But You took my place
You traded hope for my hurting
You bore the weight of my shame
I know You didn't deserve it
And I know it should've been me

(I can't believe it)"
