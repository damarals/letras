"1" "I Need You (To Be Wrong)
Switchfoot

You come round like a pirate ship
You're just business
You got a fish for a lower lip
You're just business
You're the parentless nightmare kid
You're just business
You don't answer for any of this
You're just business

I need you to be wrong
I need you to be wrong
I need you

I got a body but I lost my mind
I'm just business
A placeholder with a bottom line
I'm just business
Please don't take this personally
It's just business

You need me to be wrong
You need me to be wrong
You need me

I need you to be wrong
I need you to be wrong
All along we both were wrong
I need you"
