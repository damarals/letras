"1" "Dying To Return
Vineyard

He walked with a smile
He walked with peace
But His heart cried out
He was alone
He broke the world
Made all things new
And He tore my heart as He stood silent...

So beautiful, So beautiful

Where are You?
Where are You?
My God why have You forsaken me?
Up there alone this perfect man
Dying to return the Son was killed"
