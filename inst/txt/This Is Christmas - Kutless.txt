Kutless

Do you find it hard to sleep til' night,
Resting by the christmas lights?
Could there be something you forgot?
Beyond the bows, and mistletoes,
The tree with presents wrapped below,
There's more to this than you had ever thought?
Have we lost the reason that we celebrate each year?

What is christmas?
If there never was a savior wrapped in a manger.
What is christmas without christ?

Remember how the story goes,
God's gift was wrapped in swaddling clothes,
Beneath the star, one great and holy night.
The shepherds heard the angels sing,
The wise man brought an offering,
Peace on earth began in bethelethm
Have we lost the reason that we celebrate each year?

What is christmas?
If there never was a savior wrapped in a manger.
What is christmas?
If the angels never sang 'glory to the new born king?'
What is christmas without christ?

There'd be no gloria
In excelsis deo
Gloria
In excelsis deo

What is christmas?
If there never was a savior wrapped in a manger.
What is christmas without christ?
This is christmas,
Itâ€™s all about the savior wrapped in a manger.
This is christmas,
Because of jesus christ!
This is christmas,
Because of christ!
Because of christ!"
