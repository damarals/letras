"1" "He Never Sleeps
Take 6

Chorus:
He never sleeps,
He never slumbers
He watches me both night and day
(Day and night / night and day)
He never sleeps,
He never slumbers
The reason I know - He told me so

I don´t to worry, my soul´s in His care
I don´t have to worry, He´ll always be there
I know that He´s watching wherever I go
I know that He´s watching, He told me so

Chorus:
He never sleeps,
He never slumbers
He watches me both night and day
(Day and night / night and day)
He never sleeps,
He never slumbers
The reason I know - He told me so"
