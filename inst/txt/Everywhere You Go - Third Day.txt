"1" "Everywhere You Go
Third Day

Nothing can stop me
I am not gonna change my mind
No one can keep me from the road that I’m on this time
No matter what, I’m going to do what it takes to make it

I didn’t know what I was missing ‘til I met you
I never even thought to listen
No, I never knew
And now you’ve given me a second chance and I’ll take it

So here I am, Lord, I want to be where You are
I need You now, won’t You show me the way

Everywhere You go, I wanna go
Will You take me with You
Everywhere you lead, I wanna be by your side
Everyone you love, I wanna love
Just like you love me
Everywhere you go, I wanna go there with you

It doesn’t matter how long this is gonna take me
I’m gonna keep on moving even if it breaks me
I’ll never turn around
I have found where I am going"
