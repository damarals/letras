"1" "You Lifted Me Out
Chris Tomlin

You turned my way
You heard my cry
You turned my mourning into shouting
sorrow may last for a night
But with the light I am seeing
I am singing

You lifted me out
You lifted me out
And set me dancing, dancing
Free, now I am free
Your love rescued me
Now it`s the anthem I`m singing

Many will see
Many will hear
And find You strong enough to save
Many wonders Yu have done
Your light has come, I am singing
I am singing

Last is where You found me
Shattered and frail
But You love me still

Trouble may surround me
My heart may fail
But You never will
You never will"
