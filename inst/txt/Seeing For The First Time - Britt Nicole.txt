"1" "Seeing For The First Time
Britt Nicole

I lay here under the stars
In awe of who You are
You've never been so real
I'll never understand if fully
Lost here in Your beauty
No words could say how I feel

It's like I'm seeing for the first time
Like You opened my eyes to show me
Everything I missed before
And I want more

I used to think we were worlds apart
But look, here You are
Let's stay here for a while
Where Heaven touches Earth
My heart begins to turn
I've never felt so alive

How many years
Did You plan this moment here
To show me how You love me
How many years
Did you plan this moment here
To show me how You love me"
