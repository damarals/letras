"1" "All Your Promises
Vineyard

O Lord our Lord,
How majestic is Your name
Your words are true
Your mercy does not change
All Your promises are precious
Reviving our faith
Everyone of them will be fulfilled one day

Chorus:
Oh all your promises
are yes and amen in Jesus
Your promises are true*
All Your promises
are yes and amen Lord Jesus
We'll keep running after You

We will run
we'll run and not grow weary
We will rise upon the eagle's wings
in the presence of the Lord
our spirits will soar
till we one day gaze upon our King

Bridge:
But my feet had almost slipped
O Lord I'd almost lost my way
Till I entered the house of the Lord
and heard your sweet Spirit say"
