P.O.D.

Snuff the punk, I'm getting tired of you chump
Bass in your face You'll get a taste of P.O.D. Funk
When I say punk or chump I don't mean you
Talkin about the Devil and his crew
Listen
You came to rob and steal from the helpless
Warriors in Christ we stand up for the defensless
So if you can get with this then step to this
And if you say yes sing the P.O.D. checklist
This is a spiritual war, we take no prisoners
Live a life of sin, you don't know what your getting into
You picked a winner, love the sinner, hate the sin dude
We got a plan to understand, Here's what we gonna do

Snuff Da Punk, Snuff the Punk, Snuff 'em, Snuff 'em
Snuff the Punk, Snuff the Punk
2x

P.O.D. hit one more time for those that don't be knowin'
Merrily, merrily, merrily down the stream is how I'm flowin'
Keep goin, don't stop all props to P.O.D.
P.O.D. The Gospel, The Gospel that Rocks
Rock You, We did it, I think it's time to quit it
And when my King is greaking, Yo, You better take a seat kid
The Shield of God, ain't nothin' gonna hurt me
And too rough, We're gonna get down and dirty
I told you once before homie, This is the real deal
No time to win your soul, it's too late, we gotta steal it
Blinded by ignorance use some common sense
Though so tough God challenged my bluff 'G
I thank the Lord the day he snuffed a Punk like Me

Snuff the Punk, P.O.D. Snuff the Punk
