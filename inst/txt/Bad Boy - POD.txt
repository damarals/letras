"1" "Bad Boy
P.O.D.

I like the girl with the big ol' eyes
Cuz I can see her mind, body and soul harmonize
And she's so fine I can't say love is blind
But I know it got me shook, got me mesmerized
The kind of girl when she steps in the room
You know she steps to her own tune
She's gotta custom fitted, one of kind gown to the
Ball not someone else's costume
And miss right dont come in two's
So I'm careful bout who I choose
These little floozies can't dance on my cues
They wasting time tryin to fill your shoes

I'm a bad boy and I like good girls
The kind you wanna take home to meet your mama
You know that I'm a bad boy, but I wanna good girl
To share my world and show you how I do it

Girl you know how I do
Girl I know you heard of me and my crew
Girl I'm lookin' for a love that's true
Not just another ho to do
Cuz when it's all said done
I need more than a hit and run
But don't get me wrong you can be real fun
But it's time for me to find the one
The one I wanna spend the rest of my life with
The one to have too many kids with
So I'ma wife you up and make it right
Gonna turn you to a freak tonight

I'm a bad boy and I like good girls
The kind you wanna take home to meet your mama
You know that I'm a bad boy, but I wanna good girl
To share my world and show you how I do it

Undying love, that's what I'm after.
Like Mark Anthony and Cleopatra.
I need a girl who's down to ride.
I need a Bonnie and I can be your Clyde.
I wanna girl I can love to death like Romeo and Juliet.

I'm a bad boy and I like good girls
The kind you wanna take home to meet your mama
You know that I'm a bad boy, but I wanna good girl
To share my world and show you how I do it

When the party's over you are there.
Girl you're teasing me but I'm gonna wait cuz I wanna
Take you home to meet my mama.
Cuz I wanna good girl
To share my world and show you how I do it."
