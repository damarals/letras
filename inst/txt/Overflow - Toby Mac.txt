"x"
"1" "Overflow
Toby Mac

Clap your hands everybody
Everybody just clap your hands
Some things money can't buy
But a man's gotta eat
Bread don't just fall out the sky
And land at your feet
I was trying to fly high
But I ran low like I'm sitting on E
And my well ran dry
'Til You came and made it rain on me

You fill my cup up
'Til it overflows
And it's the sweetest love
That I've ever known
So, pour it on me
All that I need deep down in my soul
Fill my cup up
'Til it overflows

They say nothin' is perfect
That ain't true
'Cause You came and opened these eyes
To the glory of You
You turned water to wine
You make a new man of me
And every time I'm running empty

It ain't a glass half-full
Or a glass half-empty
It's running over
It can't fit me
Down every side to the ground
More than enough to go around
So come and get it, come and get it while it's hot
Come and get it, come and get it nonstop
'Cause the only thing sweeter than a love song
Is singing of love that goes on, and on, and on, and on"
