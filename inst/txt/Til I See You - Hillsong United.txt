Hillsong United

THE GREATEST LOVE THAT ANYONE COULD EVER KNOW,
OVERCAME THE CROSS AND GRAVE TO FIND MY SOUL
UNTIL I SEE YOU FACE TO FACE AND GRACE AMAZING TAKES ME HOME
I´LL TRUST IN YOU

I WITH ALL I AM I LIVE TO SEE YOUR KINGDOM COME
AND IN MY HEART I PRAY YOU´LL LET YOUR WILL BE DONE
UNTIL I SEE YOU FACE TO FACE AND GRACE AMAZING TAKES ME HOME
I´LL TRUST IN YOU

I WILL LIVE TO LOVE YOU
I WILL LIVE TO BRING YOU PRAISE
I WILL LIVE A CHILD IN AWE OF YOU

YOU ARE THE VOICE THAT CALLS THE UNIVERSE TO BE
YOU ARE THE WHISPER IN MY HEART THAT SPEAKS TO ME
UNTIL I SEE YOU FACE TO FACE AND GRACE AMAZING TAKES ME HOME
I´LL TRUST IN YOU
YOU ALONE ARE GOD OF ALL
YOU ALONE ARE WORTHY LORD
AND WITH ALL I AM
MY SOUL WILL BLESS YOUR NAME"
