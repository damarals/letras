"1" "O' Come All Ye Faithful
Amy Grant

O' come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O' come ye, come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of angles
O' come let us adore Him
O' come let us adore Him
O' come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
Oh Jesus to Thee be all glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O' come let us adore Him
O' come let us adore Him
O' come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
O' come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
