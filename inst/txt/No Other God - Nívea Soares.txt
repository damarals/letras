"1" "No Other God
NÃ­vea Soares

Your name is above all names
Enthroned upon the universe you are
You are king and rule forever
In the face of your glory
Every knee shall bown

Why would the nations say?
Where is your God?
You are sovereign, you reign
Above all
My life belongs to you
And i live to proclaim among the nations, you are God

There is no other god like you, Jesus
There is no other god like you, Jesus
There is no other god like you, Jesus
We adore you, we exalt you
