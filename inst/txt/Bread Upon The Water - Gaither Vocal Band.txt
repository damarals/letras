"1" "Bread Upon The Water
Gaither Vocal Band

And there are people
Who think they’re not receiving
Anything from God at all
Oh, They are shaken from their believing
When they don’t see results take quickly fall

But don’t you waver and keep on living
In the way God want you to
Don’t get discouraged and keep on giving
Soon it will come back to you

Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it’s gonna come back home on everyway
Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it’s gonna come back home on everyway

Good measure pressed down
Shaken together running over
Soon it’s gonna come back home on everyway

Oh, Keep on working seeking the kingdom
Instead of working for your needs
Just keep on sharing the love of Jesus
You know, growing comes from clemencies

Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it’s gonna come back home on everyway
Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it’s gonna come back home on everyway

Good measure pressed down
Shaken together running over
Soon it’s gonna come back home on everyway

uhh... everyway!

Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it´s gonna come back home on everyway
Keep on casting
your bread upon the water
Soon it´s gonna come back home on everyway

Good measure pressed down
Shaken together running over
Soon it´s gonna come back home
Keep on casting
your bread upon the water
Soon it´s gonna come back home
On everyway (give it away)
Keep on casting
your bread upon the water
Soon it´s gonna come back home
Keep on casting
your bread upon the water
Soon it´s gonna come back home
Keep on casting... Keep on casting"
