"1" "Just A Little While
Gaither Vocal Band

Soon this life will all be over
And our pilgrimage will end.
Soon we'll take our Heavenly journey
Be at home again with friends.

Heaven's gates are standing open
Waiting for our entrance there.
Some sweet day we're going over
All the beauties there to share.

Just a little while to stay here
Just a little while to wait.
Just a little while to labor
In the path that's always straight (that's always straight and narrow).

Just a little more of troubles
In this low and sinful state.
Then we'll enter Heaven's portals
Sweeping through the pearly gates.

Soon we'll see the lights of morning
And the new day will begin.
Soon we'll hear the Father calling:
\"Come my children, enter in\".

And we'll hear a choir of angels
Singing out the vic'try song.
All our troubles will be ended
And we'll be with Heaven's throng.

Just a little while to stay here
Just a little while to wait.
Just a little while to labor
In the path that's always straight (that's always straight and narrow).

Just a little more of troubles
In this low and sinful state.
Then we'll enter Heaven's portals
Sweeping through the pearly gates.

(Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while, just a little while)

Just a little while to stay here
Just a little while to wait.
Just a little while to labor
In the path that's always straight (that's always straight and narrow).

Just a little more of troubles
In this low and sinful state.
Then we'll enter Heaven's portals
Sweeping through the pearly gates.

Then we'll enter Heaven's portals
Sweeping through the pearly gates."
