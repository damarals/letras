Warren Barfield

I bought into all the hype
Yeah I believed a lie
I hoped that they were right
And I could not fall but I fell so far

Maybe that is why
I’ve always been afraid of heights
‘Cause when you’re up that high
It’s easy to see how small you are

I’m just a raindrop
In Your ocean

You have unleashed Your love on me
And it fills me up
You have unleashed Your love on me
And it fills me up

It’s impossible to drain
The gospel from these veins
Oh Lord, You knew my name
Before this world was

I am not afraid
I’m immune to what they say
My perspective has been changed
By the passion in Your touch

I’m just a raindrop
In Your ocean

You alone, You alone are enough, only You
You alone, You alone, You fill me up, only You
You alone, yeah, You alone, yeah, You alone are enough
Only You, only You, yeah, yeah, yeah"
