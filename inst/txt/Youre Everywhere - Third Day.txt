"1" "You're Everywhere
Third Day

Like the rain that falls to the earth below
Watering the seed to grow
So it is with Your precious word, oh Lord
It won't return until i know that

You're everywhere
You're everywhere

Like the wind that blows no one really knows
From where it comes or where it goes
So it is with Your Holy Spirit Lord
Falling down on us to show that

Your're everywhere
Like the rain that's falling
Your're everywhere
Like the wind that's blowing
Your're everywhere
Like the sun upon my face
I feel the warmth in Your embrace
Your are everywhere

My Lord, now I truly know
That I could never go from Your presence
My God, You are everywhere
From the lowest depths to the heavens
You're always there"
