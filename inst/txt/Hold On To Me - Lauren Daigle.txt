"1" "Hold On To Me
Lauren Daigle


When the best of me is barely breathin'
When I'm not somebody I believe in
Hold on to me
When I miss the light the night has stolen
When I'm slammin' all the doors
You've opened
Hold on to me (Hey)
Hold on to me

Hold on to me when it's too dark to see you
When I am sure I have reached the end
Hold on to me when I forget
I need You
When I let go, hold me again

When I don't feel like I'm worth defending
When I'm tired of all my pretending
Hold on to me
When I start to break in desperation
Underneath the weight of expectation
Hold on to me
Hold on to me

Hold on to me when it's too dark to see you
(I'll hold on)
When I am sure I have reached the end
Hold on to me when I forget
I need you (I'll hold on)
When I let go, hold me again

I could rest here in Your arms forever
'Cause I know nobody loves me better
Hold on to me
Hold on to me"
