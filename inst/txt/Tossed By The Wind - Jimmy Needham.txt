Jimmy Needham

This here's the story of Tossed By The Wind
Who went out on his own with deceptions of men
He was warned by his Mama
Â‘Son, don't listen to them'
And here's what she said to our friend

Be sure that no one takes you captive
By deceptions of men
Â‘Cause you will find it to be tragic in the end

To begin he was with Him
With Him and glad
Mr. Pure and Simple was the only one he knew
Oh, and all that he had
Â‘Til he heard from the learned
Â‘Son, your facts are all wrong'
The Jesus he knew got cut out of his songs
Now he sings praises to Hume all day long

Be sure that no one takes you captive
By deceptions of men
Â‘Cause you will find it to be tragic in the end

We've been infecting your sons and your daughters
Make all checks payable to your alma mater
They're training for life on their own
So far from home
This here's the story of Tossed By The Wind
Who was cursed for his thirst for the wisdom of men
Now broken and hopeless
He heard from within
A still small voice calling to him
Â‘Lies always fail in the end
Truth will prevail in the end
My grace is sufficient my friend'"
