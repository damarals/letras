Hillsong United

The words of Christ
Passed down through generations
The son of God teaching us to pray
Echoed words
Father, have your will
Your way in me completely

We wholly trust
You're faithful in provision
Amazing Grace, mercy for our sins
May we forgive the way that
You've forgiven us oh lord
So we can sing

Our father
Hallowed be your name
Forever our God be exalted
Your kingdom come and in us
Let your will be done
Our father

Lead us from the valley of temptation
Deliver us from the evil one
Lord you reign and here we stand
Victorious in Your name
Together we pray

Yours is the kingdom and power and glory
God of authority
Ancient of days
Yours is the wisdom and honour
Forever and always and always

Yours is the kingdom and power and glory
God of authority
Ancient of days
Yours is the wisdom and honour
Forever and always we pray"
