"1" "Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
Hinos Sud

Come, Thou Fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy, never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wand'ring from the face of God
He, to save my soul from danger
Interposed His precious blood

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter
Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee
Teach me, Lord, some rapturous measure
Meet for me Thy grace to prove
While I sing the countless treasure
Of my God's unchanging love

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Take my heart, oh, take and seal it
With Thy Spirit from above
Rescued thus from sin and danger
Purchased by the Savior's blood
May I walk on earth a stranger
As a son and heir of God"
