"1" "Power To Redeem
Lauren Daigle

You take what is
And you make it beautiful
When love floods in
We're resorted forever more
With breath it brings the dead to life
With words that pierce the dark with light
Only by the blood are we set free
With mercy strong to carry shame
And nail it to a tree
You alone hold the power to redeem

No guilt competes
With innocence crucified
No grave can hold what your grace has justified
With breath it brings the dead to life
With words that pierce the dark with light
Only by the blood are we set free
With mercy strong to carry shame
And nail it to a tree
You alone hold the power to redeem

Rejoice oh child of God
Lift your eyes to see
With every morning light
Again we are redeemed

With breath it brings the dead to life
With words that pierce the dark with light
Only by the blood are we set free
With mercy strong to carry shame
And nail it to a tree
You alone hold the power to redeem
Oh you alone, hold the power to redeem"
