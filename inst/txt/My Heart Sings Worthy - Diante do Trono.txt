"1" "My Heart Sings Worthy
Diante do Trono

You treasure me when i'm feeling empty
You cover me in embrace overwhelming
And my soul when you speak
Your words are keeping me whole

You confort me when i have no joy
Your love strenths me
It's all i can live for
And my all is for you, redeemer of my soul

And i will be the sweetest offering
And i will be the praise you heart desires

As my heart sings worthy
My heart sings worthy
I've found none other like you

My heart sings worthy
My heart sings worthy
I've found none other like you

You rescued me from all of my failures
You set me free to live in this freedom
And my live only lives
Displaying all you've done

And i will be the sweetest offering
And i will be the praise you heart desires

As my heart sings worthy
My heart sings worthy
I've found none other like you

My heart sings worthy
My heart sings worthy
I've found none other like you"
