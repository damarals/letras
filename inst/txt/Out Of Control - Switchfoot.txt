"1" "Out Of Control
Switchfoot

You were a sure thing
You were my diamond ring
I was your surgery
Your emergency
I was your outlaw
I was your fatal flaw
You were my iodine
I was your valentine

Im not sure why youre here tonight,
Feels like youre looking for a fight
Today a lifetime has passed before my eyes

I thought i knew you
What have we come to
What came of you and me
And the distance in between
You were the one who always opened up my soul
Now here we go out of control.


Well we can overthrow the world that we all knew
Wasnt i the rock upon which you were building something new
I felt like royalty
Do you question loyalty
Till i deny that i had ever known your authority

How could a kiss become a fight?
How could the darkness kill the light?
How could everything i trusted in be crucified

I thought i knew you
What have we come to
What came of you and me
And the distance in between
You were the one who always opened up my soul
Now here we go out of control

And i still dont understand
Any part of your dying plan
You were so hell-bent
To get to hell and back again

I thought i knew you
What have we come to
Caught in the in between
Stuck in the darkest dream
You were the one who always opened up my soul
Now here we go out of control

Out of control
Out of control"
