"1" "Show Me The Way
Vineyard

I see the road ahead
But I don't know if I can carry on
So strengthen me and I will run
Into Your arms

I just can't live without You
That's what I like best about You

I've got to leave this world behind
It's growin' weary on me
My feet are heavy, Heaven help me
I'm callin' Your name

I just can't live without You
That's what I like best about You

Show me the way
I've got to find my way somehow"
