In your presence I quiet my soul
And I hear your voice
In my spirit I hear the sound
Of salvation's song
Jesus, Jesus

I will wait in your word oh lord
There your spirit speaks
Bringing life to the weary soul
To the depths of me
Jesus, Jesus

I love you with all my heart
I love you with all my soul lord
I love you with all my strength
With all that is within me

I'll sing cause you saved my soul
I'll sing of your love forever
I'll worship with all my heart
With all that is within me"
