"x"
"1" "Be Still
Selah

It's so loud
I Just can't seems to slow this down
I need you more than ever now
Let the silence be the only sound

Your glory
Becomes the only thing that I see
Your beauty brings me to my knees
Awe that you inspire in me

Chorus:

Makes me wanna be still
So still you can hear me breathing in
So still you can hear me breathing out
Let Your calm descend upon me now

So now
I stand before you broken down
My feet upon this holy ground
I can feel Your presence all around

Chorus

I hear You
Whisper softly
I hear You
Speaking to Me
I hear You
In the silence you call my name

Modified Chorus (2x)

I want to be still
So still you can hear me breathing in
So still you can hear me breathing out
Let Your calm descend upon me now

I want to be still (2x)
Be Still"
