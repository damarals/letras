"1" "Move (Keep Walkin')
Toby Mac

Another heartbreak day
Feels like you're miles away
Don't even need no shade
When your sun don't shine, shine

Too many passin' dreams
Roll by like limousines
It's hard to keep believin'
When they pass you by and by

I know your heart been broke again
I know your prayers ain't been answered yet
I know you're feeling like you got nothing left
Well, lift your head, it ain't over yet, ain't over yet so

Move, keep walkin' soldier keep movin' on
Move, keep walkin' until the mornin' comes
Move, keep walkin' soldier keep movin' on
And lift your head, it ain't over yet, ain't over yet

Echoin' inside your head
Are the words that your sweet momma said
\"shoot for the moon, my dear\"
So you took aim out of this atmosphere
Between high stakes and pump fakes
You're feelin' like you can't buy a break
I can hold your hand, but I can't turn your eyes to freedom

Hold on, hold on
Lord ain't finished yet
Hold on, hold on
He'll get you through this
Hold on, hold on
These are the promises
I never will forget
I never will forget

I know your heart been broke again
I know your prayers ain't been answered yet
Well it ain't over yet, it ain't over yet so"
