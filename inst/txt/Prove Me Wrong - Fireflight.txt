"1" "Prove Me Wrong
Fireflight

Fresh tracks of tears upon my face
Trace the pain I can't erase
I shut the door and lock myself in
I try to hide the shame I feed
Bleed the source of my disease
I don't think love can go where I've been
There's just no hope that I can see

You prove me wrong, you prove me wrong
When I'm fighting for my broken heart
I tear my whole world apart
You prove me wrong, you prove me wrong
You see the me that no one does
And you show me at last I can be loved

Swallow the memories that hurt
Burn the pages and unlearn
This mask I wear I've worn for too long
You found a way through my regrets
Spread the light to guide my steps
Out of darkness to where I belong
I can't fall when you carry me

You prove me wrong, you prove me wrong
When I'm fighting for my broken heart
I tear my whole world apart
You prove me wrong, you prove me wrong
You see the me that no one does
And you show me at last I can be loved

I thought there was nothing left
I thought all my hope was dead
You brought me to life
Your love's become the air I breathe
You mean everything to me
I am finally free from the lies

You prove me wrong, you prove me wrong
When I'm fighting for my broken heart
I tear my whole world apart
You prove me wrong, you prove me wrong
You see the me that no one does
And you show me at last that I am loved"
