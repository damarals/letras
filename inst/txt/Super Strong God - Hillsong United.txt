Hillsong United

Sometimes I wonder what life really means
Then I see Jesus within You and me
Your gift to us, Lord, none can compare
Living for Jesus, His praise I declare

Creation shouts of You...

Super Strong God
You loved me
Super Strong God
You made everything, so beautiful!

Super Strong God...."
