"1" "To You Alone
Vineyard

Before You now, the heavens open
We join in the song
Since creation was spoken
Bowing low, singing with the angels
Our worship fl ows
From all of the nations

Jesus, only to You
To You I will give
My worship, oh holy King
My holy King

This is the moment
That I have been longing for
To meet with my God, only You can satisfy
This is my hearts cry
My burning passion
To draw close to You
For You alone are all that I desire

Only You, only You, Jesus, my God"
