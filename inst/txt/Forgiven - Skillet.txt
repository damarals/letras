Forgive me now cause I
Have been unfaithful
Don't ask me why cause I don't know
So many times I've tried
But was unable
This heart belongs to you alone

Now I'm in our secret place
Alone in your embrace
Where all my wrongs have been erased
You have forgiven
All the promises and lies
All the times I compromise
All the times you were denied
You have forgiven

Forgive me I'm ashamed
I've loved another
I can't explain cause I don't know
No one can take your place
And there is no other
Forever yours and yours alone

Now I'm in our secret place
Alone in your embrace
Where all my wrongs have been erased
You have forgiven
All the promises and lies
All the times I compromise
All the times you were denied
You have forgiven

Oh,oh,oh,
Oh,oh,oh,
Oh,oh,oh
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, Yeah

I get down on my knees
Feel your love wash over me
There will never be another
You're the only one forever
And you know I'm yours alone

I'm in our secret place
Alone in your embrace
Where all my wrongs have been erased
You have forgiven
All the promises and lies
All the times I compromise
All the times you were denied
You have forgiven

Oh,oh,oh,
Oh,oh,oh,
Oh,oh,oh

You have forgiven
Forgiven"
