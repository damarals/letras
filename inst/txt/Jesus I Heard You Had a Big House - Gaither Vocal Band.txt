"1" "Jesus, I Heard You Had a Big House
Gaither Vocal Band

Jesus, I heard you had a big house,
Where I could have a room of my own.
And jesus, I heard you had a big yard,
Big enough to let a kid roam.

I heard you had clothes in your closet,
Just the right size that I wear,
And jesus, I heard if I give you my heart,
Then you would let me go there.

Jesus, I heard about meal time,
When all your children come to eat,
I heard you got a great big table
Where every kid can have his own seat.

Jesus, they said there will be plenty
Of good things to children to share,
And jesus, I'd just like to tell you
I sure would like to go there.

Jesus, I heard that in your big house
There's plenty of love to go 'round.
I heard there's always singing and laughter
To fill the place with happy sounds.

And I've been thinking that a friend
Who would give me all that he's got
Before I had even met him
Well, he sure must love me a lot.

And jesus, I'd just want to tell you,
I sure do love you a lot!

Jesus, we just want to tell you,
We sure do love you a lot!"
