Youthful Praise

Lord You know everything I've done
Every thought I've had, You know every one
And Lord You know every time I fall
Still You come to my rescue when I call
Lord You hear every idle word,
Every thoughtless deed, how it seems absurd
That Lord You give, not what I am due
But mercy; You come to my rescue
You come to my rescue, rescue (x4)
Lord You care and You've become my friend
Amazing love whose boundaries have no end
And Lord You show what a greater love can do
By being there for my rescue
And Lord I give all I can give (all my heart)
All of my heart as long as I shall live
So Lord, oh Lord, I just want to thank You
For coming, coming to my rescue
You come to my rescue, rescue (x4)
It's hard to tell You just how grateful I am
But I'm still gonna make it show.
With every breath gonna let You know
I am accepting though I can't comprehend
How I could be worth the cost
When I was bound, despised and lost
Lord I give all I can give (all my heart)
All of my heart as long as I shall live
So Lord, oh Lord, I just want to thank You (I really want to thank you)
For coming, for coming to my rescue
You come to my rescue, rescue (x2)
He is always there for me (rescue, rescue)
And he'll be right, right there for you (rescue, rescue)
Oh Lord I know I don't deserve it (rescue, rescue)
But you love me anyhow (rescue, rescue)
You come to my rescue (rescue, rescue)
Keep on coming to my rescue (rescue, rescue)
Repeat last two lines and fade"
