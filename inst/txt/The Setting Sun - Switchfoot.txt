"1" "The Setting Sun
Switchfoot

I've got a wound that doesn't heal
Burning out again
Burning out again

I'm not sure which of me is real
I'm alone again
Burning out again

My hope runs underneath it all
The day that I'll be home

It won't be long
I belong
Somewhere past this setting sun
Finally free
Finally strong
Somewhere back where I belong

They're selling shares of me again
But I'm not buying it
I'm not buying it

My wound goes deeper then the skin
There's no hiding it
So I'm not trying it

My hope runs underneath it all
The day that I'll be home

It won't be long
I belong
Somewhere past this setting sun
Finally free
Finally strong
Somewhere back where I belong

Let the weak say I am strong
And it won't be long
Let the right say I was wrong
And it won't be long
Let us find where we belong
Beyond this setting sun
Beyond this setting sun

It won't be long
I belong
Somewhere past this setting sun
Finally free
Finally strong
Somewhere back where I belong"
