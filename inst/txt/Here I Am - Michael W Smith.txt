"1" "Here I Am
Michael W. Smith

There’s a place where I can go
Where the angels hear me pray
“I want to change
Yes I need Your touch”
I’m waiting here for You

And I fall, at Your feet
I’ll give it all, until the day we meet

Chorus
Here I am
Ready to give up my life for the One
Here I am
Ready to pour out my heart for the Son

Here I come to Your threshing floor
Where the angels fear to tread
I’m waiting here for the King of love
And to hold the hands that bled"
