"1" "Criminal Conversations (Feat. Maria Brink)
P.O.D.

You came out to meet me
I looked for you and I found you here
And I can sense your sweetness
So lost in you I disappear

You got me on the end of your line
Your criminal conversations
Senseless observations
You got me holding onto your line

So delicate and lovely
So high off your love it's still a blur
I know he's got no one's home
So let's enjoy ourselves together

You got me on the end of your line
Your criminal conversations
Senseless observations
You got me holding onto your lies

Your criminal conversations
Dirty explanations
So I'll be waiting all of my life
All of my life
All of my life
All of my life
All of my life

Criminal conversations
Venomous ventilations
You got me on the end of your line
Criminal conversations
Illicit consultations
So I'll keep waiting all of my life

I'll keep waiting
And I'll keep waiting

Criminal conversations
Senseless observations
You got me holding onto your lies

Your criminal conversations
Dirty explanations

So I'll be waiting all of my life"
