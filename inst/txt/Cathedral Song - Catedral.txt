Catedral

I saw you from the cathedral
You were watching me
And I saw from the cathedral
What I should be

So take my lies
And take my time
'Cos all the others want to take my life

É deserto
Onde eu te encontrei
Você me viu passar
Correndo só
Nem pude ver
Que o tempo é maior

Olhei pra mim
Me vi assim
Tão perto de chegar
Onde você não está

Serious for the winter time
To wrench my soul
whole cotton, whole cotton ears
But I know there must be
There must be, yes, I know there must be a place to go

You saw me from the cathedral
Well I'm an ancient heart
Yes, you saw me from the cathedral
Well here we are just falling apart

You catch me
I am tired
I want all that you are


Se eu disser
Que foi por amor
Não vou mentir pra mim

And I saw from the cathedral
You could not see to see

So take my time
And take my lies
'Cos all the others want to take my life"
