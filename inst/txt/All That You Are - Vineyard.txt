Vineyard

Lord how can this be
That You would meet with me
All around this place
I see Your grace
All You've done for us
Shed Your blood for us
With all that I am
You still came You call my name
You still came You call my name

All that You are to me
More than I've ever dreamed
More than I have believed
All that You are
All that I am to You
More than I ever knew
All that You are, all that You are
All that You are"
