"1" "How I Long For You
Hillsong United

I feel Your love right through my heart
my spirit lifted by Yours
You are too great,
too great for words
so hear the song of my heart

How I long
Father
How I long for you

Freedom is where You place Your feet
light always shines through the dark
ever thought of You
for I am Yours
greatest of any rewards
How I Long For You"
