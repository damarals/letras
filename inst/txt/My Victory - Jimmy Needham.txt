"1" "My Victory
Jimmy Needham

Never turning back to the way things were
I'm stronger now than i was before
I hear the sound that freedom brings
It's ringing loud
Now i am free to lift my eyes
For grace is alive

You are the hope that broke the dark in me
You are the light that shines when i can't see
You are, you are, you are my victory

My weakness yours, your mercy mine
My god you're not the leaving kind
I sing the song that freedom brings
It's ringing loud
Now i am free to lift my eyes
My god is alive

In times of trouble
When i'm not able
You are, my god, you are
My chains are broken
Your gates are open
Hallelujah

You are the hope that broke the dark in me
You are the light that shines when i can't see
You are, you are, you are

You are the hope that broke the dark in me
You are the light that shines when i can't see
You are, you are, you are my victory
You are my victory, god you deliver me, you are my victory"
