"1" "Written In Red
Gaither Vocal Band

Uh, uh, uh
In letters of crimson, God wrote his love
On the hillside so long, long ago
For you and for me Jesus died
And love's greatest history was told

I love you, I love you
That's what calvary said
I love you, I love you
I love you, written in red

Down through the ages, God wrote his love
With the same hands that suffered and bleed
Giving all thet he had to give
A message so easily read

I love you, I love you
That's what calvary said
I love you, I love you
I love you, written in red
I love you, I love you
I love you, written in red"
