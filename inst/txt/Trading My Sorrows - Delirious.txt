"1" "Trading My Sorrows
Delirious

I'm trading my sorrows
i'm trading my shame
i'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord

i'm trading my sickness
i'm trading my pain
i'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord

We say yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord
yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord
yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord, amen

We say yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord
yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord
yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord, amen

i am pressed but not crushed
persecuted, but not abandoned
struck down, but not destroyed
i am blessed beyond the curse,
for His promise will endure
and His joy will be my strength

though the sorrow may last for the night
His joy comes with the morning.

I'm trading my sorrows
i'm trading my shame
i'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord

i'm trading my sickness
i'm trading my pain
i'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord

We say yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord
yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord
yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord, amen

We say yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord
yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord
yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord, amen

i am pressed but not crushed
persecuted, but not abandoned
struck down, but not destroyed
i am blessed beyond the curse,
for His promise will endure
and His joy will be my strength

Though the sorrow may last for the night
His joy comes with the morning.

I'm trading my sorrows
i'm trading my shame
i'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord

i'm trading my sickness
i'm trading my pain
i'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord
