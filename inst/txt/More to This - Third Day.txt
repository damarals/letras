Third Day

Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day

From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #8.

People get ready
For something like you've never seen

Open up your eyes
Open up your heart
Open up your arms and let the Spirit of the Savior set you free

You ain't seen nothing yet
All the rumors are true
I don't know about you
But I know there's more to this

People, here it is
Just what we've all been waiting for

There's more to life
Than being born and dying
There's more to life Than slowly growing old
If we are wise We'll keep our eyes on Jesus
