Vineyard

I will praise You, oh Lord, with all my heart
I will tell of Your wonderful deeds
I will sing with joy because of You
I will praise You the Almighty God

I will rejoice in You, because You love me
I will rejoice in You, because You saved me

You are King forever
You rule with righteousness
You are my deliverer
In You Lord I can trust"
