"1" "Then Came The Morning
Gaither Vocal Band

They all walked away, nothing to say,
They just lost their dearest Friend;
All that He said, now He was dead,
So this was the way it would end!

The dreams they had dreamed,
Were not what they seemed,
Now that He was dead and gone;
The garden, the jail, the hammer, the nail,
How could a night be so long?

Then came the morning, night turned into day:
The stone was rolled away, hope rose with the dawn!
Then came the morning,
Shadows vanished before the sun;
Death had lost and life had won,
For morning had come!

The angel, the star, the kings from afar,
The wedding, the water, the wine,
Now it was done, they'd taken her Son,
Wasted before His time!

She knew it was true, she'd watched Him die too,
She'd heard them call Him just a man;
But deep in her heart she knew from the start,
Somehow her Son would live again.

Then came the morning, night turned into day:
The stone was rolled away, hope rose with the dawn!
Then came the morning,
Shadows vanished before the sun;
Death had lost and life had won,
For morning had come!

The old men will dream, the young men will seem
To know what they never have learned.
Your daughters and sons will see what's to come
Before the Messiah's return.

Wonders and signs, plans and designs,
Will play out their final day.
Rumors and war will threaten no more,
The waiting bride is caught away!

Here comes the morning, night has turned to day;
The clouds have rolled away, Eternal dawn!
Then comes the morning,
Shadows vanished before the sun.
Death has lost! and life has won,
For morning has come!

Death has lost! and life has won,
For morning has come!

Morning has come!"
