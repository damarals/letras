"1" "All For You
Vineyard

Everyday I want to be
A reflection of Your love
My heart poured out giving myself
All for You

You give to me freely
I want to be like You
With serving hands and a yielded life
All for You, Jesus
All for You, all for You,
all for You

Eyes that see and ears that hear
My Father's will for me
Stirring me to risk it all
All for You"
