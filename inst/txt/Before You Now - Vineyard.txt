"1" "Before You Now
Vineyard

Before you now
In the beauty of your presence
And as I bow
You surround me with your radiance

I worship, I worship you
I worship, I worship you

Before you now
As your loving arms enfold me
I am in awe
At the wonder of your glory

I worship, I worship you
I worship, I worship you

I've surrendered to your call upon my heart
I am captured by your passion and desire"
