Skillet

Verily, verily, I will tell thee
Nothing but the truth
Listen to the preacher
Warning you about the deceiver
I am the way, the truth, the life, life

Nations rage, wars and plagues
Lords of chaos are set in place
Raising up kingdoms small and great
Gonna make 'em all bow, power on display
Your idols will be consumed with fire, fire

Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky
The storm is rising

I am the earthquake
Armies shake at my name
I come for justice
Recognize your King
Do you want peace or war when
Heaven's force comes riding on a white horse?

Your self-proclaiming exaltation's coming to an end
Get up off my throne
before I'm riding down to judge and wage war
The armies of Heaven at my command, command
Enemies, glory thieves
Kiss the Son or get under my feet
Don't recognize me, you suppressed the truth
You say, \"Lord, Lord, \" but I don't recognize you
My kingdom is at hand, at hand

Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky
The storm is rising

I am the earthquake
Armies shake at my name
I come for justice
Recognize your King
Do you want peace or war when
Heaven's force comes riding on a white horse?
I am the earthquake
Armies shake at my name
I come for justice
Recognize your King
Do you want peace or war when
Heaven's force comes riding on a white horse?

I'm gonna strike you down
With the sword of my mouth
Why did you live in doubt?
Didn't you hear the words of the prophet?
You should have known
I got the words of God in my mouth

Gonna strike you down (I'm gonna strike you down)
With the sword of my mouth (With the sword of my mouth)
Look up in the sky

I am the earthquake
Armies shake at my name
I come for justice
Recognize your King
Do you want peace or war when
Heaven's force comes riding on a white horse?
I am the earthquake
Armies shake at my name
I come for justice
Recognize your King
Do you want peace or war when
Heaven's force comes riding on a white horse?

Gonna strike you down (I'm gonna strike you down)
With the sword of my mouth (With the sword of my mouth)
Didn't you hear the words of the prophet?
You should have known
I got the words of God in my mouth"
