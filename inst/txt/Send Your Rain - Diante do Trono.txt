"1" "Send Your Rain
Diante do Trono

There is a sweet fragrance
Arising in the air
I hear a sound closer and closer
It is coming near

Heavens are ready
Living waters come over
The dry land of my heart
I am so thirsty
Pour out your rain over me

Send your rain, send your rain
Send your rain, send your rain

There is a sweet fragrance
Arising in the air
I hear a sound closer and closer
It is coming near

Heavens are ready
Living waters come over
The dry land of this nation
We are so thirsty
Pour out your rain over us

Send your rain, send your rain
Send your rain, send your rain

I want to dance in your rain
I will not hide from your rainâ€¦2x

Waters of refreshing and restoration
Pour out your rain over me"
