"1" "Sure Enough
Amy Grant

I'm laying it all out on the table,
I'm telling you again what I've already told you before:
My love is not a soon forgotten fable;
My heart is not a box with a lock in a five and dime store.

So there's no need to question me and my feelings.
Oh, wondering if I am sure.
Ask me again, and I'll tell you the same,
Over and over.

Sure enough to never want to be without you,
Sure enough, to stay for good,
Sure enough in every little thing about you,
Sure enough.

Developing the art of collaboration,
It's dinner and a movie and a baby or two.
Now we are in the midst of a revelation, mm-hmm,
We're doing what a modern world said we could not do.

And even when our love is mellow and aging,
Oh, even when we're old and wise,
And we know then what we don't know now,
Well, I know I'll still be

Sure enough to never want to be without you,
Sure enough, to stay for good,
Sure enough in every little thing about you,
Sure enough.

(Ah, ha...that's good.)

Sure enough to never want to be without you,
Sure enough to stay for good, oh,
Sure enough in every little thing about you,
Sure enough.

Sure enough to never want to be without you,
Sure enough to stay for good,
Sure enough in every little thing about you,
Sure enough.

You know how...

Sure enough to never want to be without you,
Sure enough, oh, to stay for good,
Sure enough in every little thing about you,
Sure enough.
