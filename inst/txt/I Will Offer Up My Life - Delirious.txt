"1" "I Will Offer Up My Life
Delirious

I will offer up my life in spirit and truth
Pouring out the oil of love as my worship to You
In surrender I must give my every part
Lord receive the sacrifice of a broken heart

Chorus:
Jesus, what can I give
What can I bring
To so faithful a friend
To so loving a king
Savior, what can be said
What can be sung
As a praise of Your name
For the things You have done
Oh my words could not tell
Not even in part
Of the debt of love that is owed
By this thankful heart

You deserve my every breath for You've paid the great cost
Giving up Your life to death, even death on a cross
You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin
Opened up the gates of Heaven, and have beckoned me in

Jesus, what can I give
What can I bring
To so faithful a friend
To so loving a king
Savior, what can be said
What can be sung
As a praise of Your name
For the things You have done

Jesus, what can I give
What can I bring
To so faithful a friend
To so loving a king
Savior, what can be said
What can be sung
As a praise of Your name
For the things You have done
Oh my words could not tell
Not even in part
Of the debt of love that is owed
Of the debt of love that is owed
Of the debt of love that is owed
By this thankful heart

(this thankful heart)
(this thankful heart)

What can I give
What can I bring
What can I sing as an offering, Lord
(What can I give
What can I give to You, to You)

What can I give
What can I bring
What can I sing as an offering, Lord

What can I give
What can I bring
What can I sing as an offering, Lord

(repeat)
