Hillsong United

Holy, holy
I will bow before
My Lord and King
Hallelujah
You have come to us
You make all things new.

Emmanuel, Jesus Christ
You'll never let me go
My Shepherd and King
You're watching over me
Emmanuel

So amazing
You have named the stars
Of the deepest night
Still You love me
You have called my name
And I will follow You

Emmanuel, Jesus Christ
You'll never let me go
My Shepherd King
You're watching over me
Emmanuel

Holy, holy
God almighty
There is none like You

Emmanuel, Jesus Christ
You'll never let me go
My Shepherd and King
You're watching over me
Emmanuel, Emmanuel"
