"1" "Sweet Wind
Vineyard

There's a wind a blowin'
All across the land
A fragrant breeze of heaven

Blowin' once again
Don't know where it comes from
Don't know where it goes
But let it blow over me

Oh sweet wind (rain - fire)
Come and blow (rain - burn)
Over me

There's a rain a pourin'
Showers from above
Mercy drops are comin'
Mercy drops of love
Turn you face to heaven
Let the water pour
Well let it pour over me

There's a fire burnin'
Falling from the sky
Awesome tongues of fire
Consuming you and I
Can you feel it burnin'
Burn the sacrifice
Well let it burn over me"
