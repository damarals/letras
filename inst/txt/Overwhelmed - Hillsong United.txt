"1" "Overwhelmed
Hillsong United

I sing this praise for you alone
And once again I worship
at your throne

I lift you up you cover me
Safe and strong
sheltered by your wings

I gaze upon Your glory now
Redeeming love satisfies my soul
You summon angels all around
This joy of salvation I have found

I adore you I will come
With shouts of joy into your presence
faithful God my heart is overwhelmed by you

In Spirit and in truth I stand
To worship You with all i am

I'm yours, Lord
I am yours, my Lord
Jesus, my heart is overwhelmed"
