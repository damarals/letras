"1" "I'll Worship Only At The Feet Of Jesus
Gaither Vocal Band

I went to visit the shrine of plenty,
But found it stores all filled with dust,
I bowed at alters of gold and silver,
But as I knelt there they turned to rust.

So I'll worship only at the feet of Jesus,
His cup alone, my holy grail,
There'll be no other gods before Him,
Just Jesus only will never fail.

The call of fortune made me a pilgrim,
To journey to things promised us,
But as I climbed the promise faded,
And when blew lonely all through the night.

So I'll worship only at the feet of Jesus,
His cup alone, my holy grail,
There'll be no other gods before Him,
Just Jesus only will never fail.

Just dessert dust and empty shadows,
All promises that turned to lies,
The gods offer fail and betray me,
You alone are truth and life.

So I'll worship only at the feet of Jesus,
His cup alone, my holy grail,
There'll be no other gods before Him,
Just Jesus only will never fail.
Just Jesus only will never fail"
