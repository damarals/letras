"1" "God Is Good All The Time
Gaither Vocal Band

Chorus
God is good, yes He is
He's good all the time
God is good, you know He is
He's good all the time
You can search the whole world over
No greater friend you'll find
He's not good just once in awhile
He's good all the time

Repeat Chorus

Now we've all had friends who've let us down
You know what I'm talking about
At the very first sign of trouble
Theyâ€™re nowhere to be found
Well, Jesus stays when others go
He'll never leave your side
He's your friend in stormy weather
'Cause He's good all the time

Repeat Chorus

Well, He's the one you call
In the middle of the night
When your body moans with pain
Don't worry about that wayward child
'Cause He heard you call His name
He'll put food in your kitchen
When you don't have a dime
He's not good just now and then
He's good all the time

Repeat Chorus 2 Times

You can search the whole world over
No greater friend you'll find
He's not good just once in awhile
He's good all the time"
