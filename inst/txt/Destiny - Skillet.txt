Is there a place where I
Could leave the world behind
And say goodbye to every painful memory
Where darkness ain't my destiny?
This is my destiny
This is my destiny

Is this the life that you want?
I don't ever wanna feel this way
'Cause this is the life that you got
And no one else can ever take your place
I can't (I can't)
I won't (I won't)
Go down this road
It leaves me lost (I'm lost)
Alone (Alone)
How did I get so far from home?

Is there a place where I
Could leave the world behind
And say goodbye to every painful memory
Where darkness ain't my destiny?
I'm running towards the light
I'm free of all the rage I thought would never leave
This darkness ain't my destiny
No, I make my destiny
No, I make my destiny
This is my destiny

Is this the life that you made?
It's gettin' hard to tell who I am
It's time, it's your life to change
Even if you don't think you can
I can't (I can't)
I won't (I won't)
Just lose myself
I've got so far (So far)
To go (To go)
Just show me how to get back home

Is there a place where I
Could leave the world behind
And say goodbye to every painful memory
Where darkness ain't my destiny?
I'm running towards the light
I'm free of all the rage I thought would never leave
This darkness ain't my destiny
No, I make my destiny
No, I make my destiny

Pushing 'til I put the pain away, get away (Get away)
Bracing for the weight but it cannot break me (Break me)
Living like I'll never be afraid, not afraid (Not afraid)
This is my destiny
Pushing 'til I put the pain away, get away (Get away)
Bracing for the weight but it cannot break me (Break me)
Living like I'll never be afraid, not afraid (Not afraid)

Is there a place where I
Could leave the world behind
And say goodbye to every painful memory (Memory)
Where darkness ain't my destiny?
I'm running towards the light
I'm free of all the rage I thought would never leave
This darkness ain't my destiny
No, I make my destiny
No, I make my destiny (I'm running towards the light)
No, I make my destiny (Leave the past behind)
No, I make my destiny
This is my destiny"
