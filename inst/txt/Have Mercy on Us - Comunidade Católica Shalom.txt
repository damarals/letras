Comunidade Cat√≥lica Shalom

Lord, you came
Not to condemn
But to forgive
Lord, have mercy on us

Kyrie Eleison, Kyrie Eleison, Kyrie Eleison

Christ, who rejoices
For every sinner
Who repents
Christ, have mercy on us

Christe Eleison, Christe Eleison, Christe Eleison

Oh, Lord, who forgives all those
Whom you love
You heal our hearts
Lord, have mercy on us

Kyrie Eleison, Kyrie Eleison, Kyrie Eleison"
