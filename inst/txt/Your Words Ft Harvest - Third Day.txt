"1" "Your Words (Ft. Harvest)
Third Day

Let me hear your words
Above all other voices
Above all the distractions in this world

Let me hear Your words
Above all of the voices
Above all the distractions in this world

For your words bring life
And your voice speaks promises
Lord, your love offers more
Than anything else in this world

Your words give us life that's never ending
Your words bring us love that never fails
Everything else will fade away
But what will remain
Are your words

Let us speak your words
More than ours, more than ever
Let us share your love with all the world

Your words give us life that's never ending
Your words bring us love that never fails
Everything else will fade away
But what will remain
Are your words

The grass will wither and the flowers will fall
But the word of our God will last forever
The grass will wither and the flowers will fall
But the word of our God will last forever

Your words give us life that's never ending
Your words bring us love that never fails
Everything else will fade away
But what will remain
Are your words"
