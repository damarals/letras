Michael W. Smith

Give thanks to the Lord
Our God and King
His love endures forever
For He is good
He is above all things
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise
With a mighty hand
And outstretched arm
His love endures forever
For the life that's been reborn
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise
Sing praise, sing praise

Chorus:
Forever God is faithful
Forever God is strong
Forever God is with us
Forever and ever
Forever

From the rising to the setting sun
His love endures forever
By the grace of God we will carry on
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise
Sing praise, sing praise

Chorus (2x)

His love endures forever
His love endures forever
His love endures forever
His love endures forever
His love endures forever
His love endures forever
His love endures forever
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise
Sing praise, sing praise

Chorus: (4x)
Forever you are faithful
Forever you are strong
Forever you are with us
Forever and ever
Forever"
