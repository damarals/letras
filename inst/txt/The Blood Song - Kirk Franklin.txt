"x"
"1" "The Blood Song
Kirk Franklin

You have the power
To make the seasons change
The river flows for you
The wind whispers Your name
For me you left Your throne
And traded crown for thorns instead
I'm safe within not by Your skin
But because Your blood was red

Some say You're black, you're white
They question if you're real
We treat you like we treat ourselves
I wonder how you feel
To see your children fight inspite of
the tears for us you've shed
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

[Chorus]
For it's Strong enough
to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough
To cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough
To find me when I'm lost
Great enough
To die upon the cross
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was

We may be different but
The God we serve's the same
Yet every Sunday we separate
And bring the Father pain
Your name is higher than any other
Yet You took my place instead
And now my sins are washed away
Because Your blood was red

[Chorus]
For it's strong enough
To wash away my sins
And it's pure enough
To cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough
To find me when I'm lost"
