"x"
"1" "Brand New Start
Amy Grant

When I think of all of the things He's doin' for me,
It makes me stand in wonder at what He's making me to be.
Tryin' to walk through straight, but getting turned around,
Always makin' the Master take a backseat and wait around.

But I praise the Lord for giving me a brand new start each day,
And I praise His blessed name for guiding me all along the way.
If He didn't, I wouldn't even try.

Well maybe you can't see a change, you know these things can take time.
But now that I've found Jesus, well He's given me peace of mind.
Now ev'ry day's just a chance to grow close to Him,
I may not win all the battles, but it's a victory in Him.

Well I praise the Lord for giving me a brand new start each day,
And I praise His blessed name for guiding me all along the way.
If He didn't, I would surely die.
