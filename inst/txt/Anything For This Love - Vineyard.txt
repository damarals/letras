"1" "Anything For This Love
Vineyard

I slept but my heart was awake
Knockin' on my door
You have been here
I stood but you ran away
My love, you have awakened me

I ran, but they chased me down
They beat and they bruised my heart
I run looking for the love
That came and ruined me

Can I be sleeping
When my heart's awake?
You are so near
And yet so far away
Has anybody seen the one I love?
I would give anything for this love

How long, how long, how long
Till I find?
How long, how long, how long?
Come to me"
