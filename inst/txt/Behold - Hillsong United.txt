Hillsong United

Behold the Father's heart
The mystery He lavishes on us
As deep cries out to deep
Oh how desperately He wants us
The things of earth
Stand next to Him
Like a candle to the sun
Unfailing Father
What compares to His great love

Behold His holy Son
The Lion and the Lamb given to us
The Word became a man
That my soul should know its

Saviour
Forsaken for the sake of all

Mankind
Salvation is in His blood
Jesus Messiah
The righteous died for love

It wasn't over
For He is the risen One

Then sings my soul
Then sings my soul
How great Your love is
How great Your love is
Then sings my soul
Then sings my soul
How great Your love is
How great Your love is
Then sings my soul

Behold I have a friend
The Spirit breathing holy fire within
My ever present help
Speaking truth when I can't find it
Light up this broken heart and

Light my way
Until my time on earth is done
Oh Holy Spirit
Breathe in me like kingdom come
Oh Holy Spirit
Let Your Work in me be done

Then sings my soul
Then sings my soul
How great Your love is
How great Your love is
Then sings my soul
Then sings my soul
How great Your love is
How great Your love is
Then sings my soul
Then sings my soul
How great Your love is
How great Your love is"
