"1" "Paint The Town Red
Delirious

You know I feel there's something 'bout to break now,
You know I feel there's a city here to take now.
And it's not so tough for these ordinary hands,
When we trust someone with extraordinary plans.

You know I feel this heart's about to break now,
Cos I can see what the devil's trying to take now.
We've got this leather backed book and a freedom cry,
And we're an army of God who are ready to die.

You give us hope where hope is gone,
You fill the streets with a holy song,
We're gonna paint this big old town red.

Oh, Here we come, here we come
Oh, Here we come, here we come

You know I feel this sky's about to break now.
You know I feel our city's gonna shake now.
And we hear you call every woman and man,
\"Ring the mission bell\" and storm the gates of hell.

Miracles run from street to street,
Rise up Church for a holy meet,
We're gonna paint this big old town red
We're gonna paint this big old town red
With the blood of Jesus!"
