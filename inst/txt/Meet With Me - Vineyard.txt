"1" "Meet With Me
Vineyard

I will run to the cleft of the mountain and wait for You.

Will you come and meet with me?

I will wait in the cleft of the mountain for You to pass by,

Will you come and meet with me?


Oh what a joy it would be,

Just for a moment to lay at the feet of the Lord,

Oh more than anything that's what I long for.

Oh what a change it would bring,

Just to look deep in the face of the King who gave all.

You gave everything so You could meet with me;

Will you meet with me?"
