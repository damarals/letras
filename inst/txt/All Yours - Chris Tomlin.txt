"1" "All Yours
Chris Tomlin

You set the boundaries for the oceans
You command the wind and the waves
Standing over every season
God you reign, you reign

It's all yours
The day and the night, the earth and the sky
God it's all yours
Every breath we're taking in
We pour out again in worship

God you authored our beginning
You have numbered all our days
Your love for us is everlasting
Beyond the grave, you reign

It's all yours
The day and the night, the earth and the sky
God it's all yours
Every breath we're taking in
We pour out again in worship

The moutains rise and lift your name
The oceans roar and shout your praise
Everything is yours!

It's all yours
The day and the night, the earth and the sky
God it's all yours
Every breath we're taking in
We pour out again in worship"
