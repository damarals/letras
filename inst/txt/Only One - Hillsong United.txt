Hillsong United

I stand before you now my saviour
Shouting your praise
You've changed my world and made my heart sing
And everything I have ... I lay it at your feet

Everything is different now with you my God
You broke my chains of sin
You're always there to lift me when I fall
You never let me go ... Lord I give you my all

Now that I've found you
Everything around me is changing
Nothing will be the same
Now that you've saved me

'Cause I'll be the one to shout you're fame forever
'Cause I'll be the one to sing your praise my Saviour
You are the strength inside of me
You are the light that lets me see
My Only One"
