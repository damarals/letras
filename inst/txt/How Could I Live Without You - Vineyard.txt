"1" "How Could I Live Without You
Vineyard

I love You and I know now I always will
You are to me the very centre of my being
How could I live without You
Jesus now that I've found You, I could not turn away
Heaven is close to my heart
It's there I store my treasure, Jesus lead the way
Teach me all Your ways
And make me more like You everyday
And feed me with Your Word
And I will follow You
I find You in the glory of Your Son
And I see You in the beauty of creation"
