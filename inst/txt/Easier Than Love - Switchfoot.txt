"1" "Easier Than Love
Switchfoot

Ah La La La La La La,
Ah La La La La La La

Sex is currency
She sells cars,
She sells magazines
Addictive bittersweet, crack your hands,
with the hopeless nicotines

Everyone's a lost romantic,
Since our love became a kissing show
Everyone's a cassanova,
Come and pass me the mistletoe

Everyone's been scared to death of dying here alone

She, is easier to love
It's easier to lie
It's easier to fake and smile and brag

It's easier leave
It's easier to lie
It's harder to face ourselves at night
Feeling alone,
What have we done?
What is the monster we've become?

Were is my soul?

Ah, la, la, la, la,
La la la la la la la

Sex is industry,
The CEO, of corporate policy
Skin-deep ministry,
Suburban youth, hailing so-called liberty

Every advertising antic,
I've been a ways with a neon glow
War and love become pedantic,
We wage love with a mistletoe

Everyone's been scared to death of dying here alone

She, is easier to love
It's easier to lie
It's easier to fake and smile and brag

It's easier leave
It's easier to lie
It's harder to face ourselves at night
Feeling alone,
What have we done?
What is the monster we've become?

Were is my soul?"
