"1" "So In Love
Jeremy Camp

So many times I've fallen
so many ways I've failed You
So many times I've stepped out on my own
I know I'm undeserving,
but I feel You are preserving
The only good that I have shown
The only words that I can bring
are these very words I sing
So I sing to You now

Cause I am so in love with You
There's nothing else I'd choose
You've stolen my heart
Yes, I'm all for You

Nothing can separate me from the grace
that You gave free
I know You'll never let me go
Even though You know my frailties,
every single thing about me
You showed the greatest love that's known
The only words that I can bring
are these very words I sing
So I sing to You now

Oh, I am so in love with You
There's nothing else I'd choose
You've stolen my heart
Yes, I'm all for You

Oh, I am so in love with You
And there's nothing else I'd choose
You've stolen my heart
Yes, I'm all for You now

Time and time again You show
the depth of love that You bestow
I'll never fully understand
it's too great for me to know
But I'll always try to bring,
I'll try to bring you everything
Oh, yeah

I am so in love with You
There's nothing else I'd choose
You've stolen my heart
Oh, You have my heart now

I am so in love with You
There's nothing else I'd choose
You've stolen my heart, yes
Oh, I know it's true now

Oh, Jesus, my Jesus, here's my heart"
