Hillsong United

Redeeming King I stand Amaized
How can it be love so complete?
I'm Overwhelmed, you've died for me
My miracle is you

Oh!, Lamb of God, You rose again
Your blood alone has cleaned my sins
Though all good things come from Your hands
My miracle is You

My beautiful King, for all You've done
Ever I will sing
The greates of all miracles, you've shed your blood for me

Redeeming King, I stand Amazed..."
