Dominic Balli

My heart is overflowing with a good theme
I recite my composition concerning the King
My tongue is like the pen of a ready writer (Selah)
My God when you came out before your people
Marched through the wilderness the earth shook below
The heavens stopped at your presence dropped rained
Five thousand years you?re still the same
So when the enemy comes at me with tactics of fear and fate
Like the Lord cracked the sky and it gave forth rain
So my enemies will be made a footstool before of the King
One by one they?ll fall as heavenly armies march and sing

(Chorus:)
The Lord is warrior he?ll fight with all his might,
The enemy?s frightened as triumph cries
A shout of victory, over his enemies and he?ll go
forth
The Lord is like a man war, his light will shatter the
Darkness from night as triumph cries

The Lord is my shelter from my enemies
I will not fear what they can do to me
In the struggle I find strength for the fight
We?ll raise the banner high until we break the night
Mount up with spiritual armor
For the weapons of this warfare are far from carnal
But mighty in God for tearing down strongholds

(Chorus:)

We marching out brandishing arms upon
The wickedness battle goes on and on
We steady combattin from dawn to dawn my king had
victory all along
We focus attention from day unto day from my troubles
And unto the one that can save My brethren cryin out
Charging the battle line lookin unto the God worthy of praise and hey.
Runnin in the race till the day breaks and I'm throwin off weight gotta make haste
Enemy can't stay gotta vacate when the great name been
Proclaimed thus say the Lord And I'm gonna fight it
With a mighty mighty vigor gonna side it with the
undivided
Hot up in the battle in valley of the shadow of a
gallow and I'm runnin with a fella that I?m honored just to follow

(Chorus)"
