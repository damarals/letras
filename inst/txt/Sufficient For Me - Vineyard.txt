"1" "Sufficient For Me
Vineyard

A man of sorrows acquainted with grief
You are no stranger to the pain that i feel

Despised and rejected by those who don't believe
Yet you poured out your mercy, poured out your mercy
By your blood upon that tree

Oh your grace is sufficient for me
And your strength is made perfect in weakness
Yes your grace is sufficient for me
And your strength is made perfect in weakness
Yes your grace, oh your grace is sufficient for me

Your grace is sufficient for me, sufficient for me, for me"
