Do-do-do-dominion
Do-do-do-dominion

Life has become a war
Under our overlords
I look them in the eye
I keep crossing the bitter line
Don't hold me
I've never been nothing but strong and free
The number one enemy
'Cause I'm not hypnotized
I refuse to believe the lies

Our rebellion has begun

Dominion, dominion
Under the fists of a powerful
Dominion, dominion
Don't let the empire take control
Revolution from within
Lеt the kingdom reign begin
Dominion, dominion

Do-do-do-dominion
Do-do-do-dominion
Do-do-do-dominion
Do-do-do-dominion

Colliding chaos
Prе-programmed robots
No dissent allowed at all
A forty foot golden idol
Not your place
I'll never bow down
To the power state
Death will not dominate
The fighters finally rise
They refuse to believe the lies

Our rebellion has begun

Dominion, dominion
Under the fists of a powerful
Dominion, dominion
Don't let the empire take control
Revolution from within
Let the kingdom reign begin
Dominion, dominion
