"1" "Arms Open Wide
Hillsong United

Take my life, I lay it down
At the cross, where I am found
All I have, I give to You oh God

Take my hands and make them clean
Keep my heart in purity
That I may walk in all you have for me

Whoa, here I stand arms open wide
Whoa, I am yours and you are mine, Jesus

Take my moments and my days
Let each breath that I take
Be ever only, for you oh God

My whole life is yours I give it all
Surrendered to your name
And forever I will pray
Have your way, have your way"
