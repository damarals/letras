Hillsong United

Verse 1
Would you believe me, would you listen if I told you
that
There is a love that makes the way, and never holds you
back

Verse 2
Who would have thought that
God would give His one and only Son
Taking a stand upon the cross
To show us perfect love

Pre-chorus
So won't you break free
won't you break free
get up and dance, in His love

Chorus
His love never ending
There's no escaping the truth, there's no mistaking
its you
God forever we'll get up and dance, get up and dance
and praise you
There's no escaping your light, there's no mistaking
your life
Across the world we will get up and dance, get up and
dance and praise you

Verse 3
Now is the time to take this freedom that has come our
way
Offer our lives to see the glory of His name

Bridge
And for all our days
We are holy Lord, holding onto all your ways
We are holding on, holding on to all you've said and
you've done
We are holding on to your love
Now we will dance"
