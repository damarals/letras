"1" "I just need U
Toby Mac

Last night put the heavy on me
Woke up, and I'm feeling lonely
This world gotta a way of showin' me
Some days it'll lift you up
Some days it'll call your bluff
Man, most of my days I ain't got enough

And all I know is you're my only hope

When I'm up, when I'm down
When the wolves come around
When my feet hit the ground
I just need, I just need U
On my darkest days
When I'm losing faith
No, it ain't gonna change
I just need, I just need U
Lord, I need U
Yeah, I just need U

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil for thou art with me
Thy rod and thy staff
They comfort me when I'm beat down broken
Hold my heart when it's split wide-open
Turn these eyes to my sole protector
And break the will of this born defector

When you pull me closer I come to life

Ain't no way this thing gon' change, it's U
I need on my darkest days
When I'm losing faith
I need U every single day, every breath I take
I need U"
