Daisy, give yourself away,
Look up at the rain
The beautiful display,
of power and surrender
Giving us today,
when she gives herself away

Rain, another rainy day,
It comes up from the ocean
To give herself away,
She comes down easy
Oh rich and debt, the same,
When she gives herself away,

Let it go,
Daisy let it go
Open up your fists
This fallen world,
Doesn't hold your interest,
Doesn't hold your soul,
Daisy let it go

Pain, give yourself a name,
Call yourself contrition,
Avarice or blame
Giving isn't easy,
And neither is the rain,
when she gives herself away

Daisy, why another day?
Why another sunrise?
Who's will take the blame,
For all redemptive motion?
And every rainy day,
when he gives himself away

Let it go,
Daisy let it go,
Open your fists
This fallen world,
Doesn't hold your interest,
Doesn't hold your soul,
Daisy let it go

Let it go (ooh...)

Let it go.
Let it go.
And you let it (Go, go!)
Let it go (Go! Let it go! Let it go! Go!)
(Let it go!)
(Let it go!)"
