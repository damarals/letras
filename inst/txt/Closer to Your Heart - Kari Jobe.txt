"1" "Closer to Your Heart
Kari Jobe

I get lost inside this wonder
Cause' there's so much to discover
New dimensions of your glory
And I've only seen a glimpse

You keep drawing me
You keep drawing me
Closer to your heart
You keep calling me
You keep calling me
Closer to your heart

OOh

And every facet of your beauty
My heart responds with holy holy
Oh you never seize to amaze me
And it's only just the start
Oh it's only just the start

You keep drawing me
You keep drawing me
Closer to your heart
You keep calling me
You keep calling me
Closer to your heart

You keep drawing me
You keep drawing me
Closer to your heart
You keep calling me
You keep calling me
Closer to your heart

OOh
Closer to your heart
Holy
I get lost in your love
I get lost in your love
Holy
Full of awe and wonder
Full of awe and wonder

Holy
I get lost in your love
I get lost in your love
Holy
Full of awe and wonder
Full of awe and wonder

You keep drawing me
You keep drawing me
Closer to your heart
You keep calling me
You keep calling me
Closer to your heart

You keep drawing me
You keep drawing me
Closer to your heart
You keep calling me
You keep calling me
Closer to your heart"
