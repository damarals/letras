"1" "Good To Me
Vineyard

I cry out
For your hand of mercy to heal me
I am weak
I need your love to free me

Oh Lord, my Rock
My strength in weakness
Come rescue me, oh Lord

You are my hope
Your promise never fails me
And my desire
Is to follow You forever

For You are good
For You are good
For You are good to me
For You are good
For You are good
For You are good to me"
