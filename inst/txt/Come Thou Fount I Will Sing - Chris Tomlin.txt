"1" "Come Thou Fount (I Will Sing)
Chris Tomlin

Come thou fount of ev'ry blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of thy redeeming love

Here I raise my ebenezer
Hither by thy help I'm come
And I hope by thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wond'ring from the fold of god
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed his precious blood

How your kindness yet pursues me
How your mercy never fails me
Til the day that day shall lose me
I will sing, oh, I will sing

O to grace, how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let thy goodness like a fetter
Bind my wand'ring heart to thee
Prone to wander, lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the god I love
Here's my heart, lord, take and seal it
Seal it for thy courts above

How your kindness yet pursues me
How your mercy never fails me
Til the day that day shall lose me
I will sing, oh, I will sing

Til the day that day shall lose me
I will sing, oh, I will sing

Prone to wander, lord I feel it
Prone to leave the god I love
Here's my heart, lord, take and seal it
Seal it for thy courts above
Here's my heart, lord, take and seal it
Seal it for thy courts above"
