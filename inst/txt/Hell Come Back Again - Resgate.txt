"1" "He'll Come Back Again
Resgate

Man if you're thinking that my God
Is hanging on a cross
Just like a dead symbol of something that has gone
Oh! No! I'm sorry but you're wrong

And if you're thinking that my God
Felt tired and went back home
To sit and rest alone
And he will never come back
To bad! Cause you're wrong again

Yes he lives and shines much more than a summers day
And one day you'll see from the clouds
He will be back again

Someday he'll come again, like a lightning
Right above my head, of the clouds.
