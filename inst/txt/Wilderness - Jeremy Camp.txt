Jeremy Camp

I've had seasons of goodness
Overflowing with life
But I'm no stranger to sorrow
Or a heart that wanders sometimes

I know the darkest night cannot outrun the sun
The burden will be light but until that day comes

I will rest, I will rest
Rest my heart in Your hands
'Cause I know that I can
Put my hope in Your faithfulness
I will rest, and trust with confidence
If You're God in the good, in the promised land
You will be God
God in the wilderness

When I'm stuck in the silence
And my mind's full of noise
You're my light in the distance
You're my peace in the storm

I know the longest fight cannot outlast Your love
The will be made but until that day comes

I will rest, I will rest
Rest my heart in Your hands
'Cause I know that I can
Put my hope in Your faithfulness
I will rest, and trust with confidence
If You're God in the good, in the promised land
You will be God
God in the wilderness, in the wilderness (Oh, oh)
God in the wilderness, in the wilderness (Oh, oh)

There is joy on the horizon
I can feel it rising up, rising up
There is joy on the horizon
I can feel it rising up

I will rest, I will rest (Oh)
Rest my heart in Your hands
'Cause I know that I can
Put my hope in Your faithfulness
I will rest (I will rest) and trust with confidence (Oh)
If You're God in the good, in the promised land
You will be God
God in the wilderness, in the wilderness (Oh, oh)
God in the wilderness, in the wilderness (Oh, oh)"
