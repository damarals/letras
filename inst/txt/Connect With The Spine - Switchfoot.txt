"1" "Connect With The Spine
Switchfoot

Take her like a photograph, like any autograph
She’ll find a way to go down,
Watch her like a movie screen, like any drama queen
She’ll find a way to go down

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Play it like a cameo, and watch her overflow
She’ll find a way to go down
Run like a candidate, like any minute made
You’ll find a way to go down

I’m sick of the faces, the scene and the light
We’ll be fine when the faces connect with the spine

Yeah, yeah, yeah"
