"1" "Love Is A Fire Flame
Marina de Oliveira

I had no peace, because I couldnt love no one at all
It hurt so bad, those times when I pretended to love
Forgive if Ive hurt you so, now all I ask of you
Is to believe Ive changed, and thif love

Its a fire flame that burns in me
The strength I need to carry on, the peace I never felt before
This love is seeked in many ways
I finally found on Jesuss name, he made me understand
His love, His peace, and now, I want to give it all to you
He has made me see, that when
Pretending loving you I left you with a broken heart
Believe it can be changed
I know that love can mend it cause this love
Its a fire flame that burns in me
The strength I need to carry on,
The peace I never felt before
his love is seeked in many ways
finally found on Jesuss name,
He made me understand His love\""
