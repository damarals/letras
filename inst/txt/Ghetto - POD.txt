"x"
"1" "Ghetto
P.O.D.

I believe that this world believes in love(x2)
(Love)
we might never really agree on anything about the lives we live
between you and me so differently
we dont always see things the same we should agree to disagree
if we meet and love we can work it out
I believe you and I will overcome
I believe you and I believe in love(love)
whether you think im so confused or if you feel the way i do so dont give in
to this hate within
living in this world of pain dont let it bring you down

THE WORLD IS A GHETTO (x6)

i believe that this world believes in love (x2)
i believe you and i believe in love (x2)"
