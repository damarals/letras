"1" "But The Blood
Kirk Franklin

Born alone and left to die
Rejected, often criticized
Hid behind the childhood lies
Everything has changed since the Blood
Since the Blood
Since the Blood
Oh, the Blood

Born alone and left to die
Rejected, often criticized
Hid behind the childhood lies
Everything has changed since the Blood
(Falling on us)
Since the Blood (Gave me purpose)
Since the Blood (It says you're for us)
Since the Blood (who can be against us)

Hopeless fallen from the air
Reaching but no hand is there
Screaming, quiet, no one cares
I might as well have died
But the Blood (Falling on us)
But the Blood (Gave me purpose)
But the Blood (it says you're for us)
Oh, the Blood (who can be against us)

[Choir:]
Oh, the cleansing power
That takes the guilt away
The Lamb was sacrificed now we
No longer fear the grave
No more condemnation
The debt of man is paid

By the Blood
But for the Blood [Repeat]

Now we are never alone
Your Blood, it makes us strong
Now there is power to move on
Never, we are never alone
[Repeat]"
