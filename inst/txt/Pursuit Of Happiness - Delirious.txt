"1" "Pursuit Of Happiness
Delirious

In pursuit of happiness
You're only finding sorrow
I run away and I confess
I'll try again tomorrow

Tomorrow, can I begin again?
And stick with you to the end
I know what I have said
I know what I have done
In the pursuit of happiness

How can I be satisfied?
Beg, steal or borrow
God knows the tears I've cried
I'll try again tomorrow

If I could only find
A way to your heart
I know that I could be there
Just like you think I should
You know I would"
