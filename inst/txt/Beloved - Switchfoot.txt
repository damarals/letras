Switchfoot

Maybe all the world is insecure
Maybe all of us are looking for a cure
Maybe something that can finally reassure, maybe
We're chasing after money like a dog
But the money's never gonna be enough
No, it's never gonna take the place of love, maybe
I'm still looking for the truth
But I can't seem to find it in the news
Maybe I'll start singing like the blues, maybe
The days start feeling like the nights
Like it's just anothеr way to lose a fight
Like I'm the only onе
who's looking for the light, maybe

If only I could open up my eyes
Would the truth be what would set me free?
If only I could open up my eyes
Would I see that maybe I need you
Like you need me?

And the new year dawns
And the old year's drifting on and on
Like my doubt's in orbit 'round the Sun

Everyday begins to feel the same
Like I'm waiting on the wind to go and change
But there's no one but myself to blame lately
I'm staring and despairing on the screen
Turning everything that's real into a meme
But the feeds that I read don't feed me what I need

Oh, if only I could open up my eyes
Would the truth be what would set me free?
If only I could open up my eyes
Would I see that maybe I need you
Like you need me?

And the new year dawns
And the old year's drifting on and on
Like my doubt's in orbit 'round the Sun
And I still take a run?
To be somewhere that still needs broken
longing songs
Like my doubt's in orbit 'round the Sun
Around the Sun
Around the Sun
Around the Sun
Ooh, ooh

The questions that we're too afraid to ask
'Cause the present is the future of the past
'Cause the river is the same, but moving fast lately
And maybe every other is a weed
Maybe differences are easier to see
Than a family we are that's underneath, maybe

Like you need me
And the new year dawns
And the old year's drifting on and on
Like my doubt's in orbit 'round the Sun
And I'm looking in your eyes
I see reflections of the sea reflecting the sky
(I see myself looking at you
looking at me looking up)
The sky (I see myself looking at you looking at me)
I start to recognize that I need you
I start to recognize that I need you
Like you need me

Like I need you
Like you need me"
