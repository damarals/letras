"1" "Angels Fall Down
Skillet

I saw angels fall down
At the glory of the Lord
And as I raise my hands I see

I saw angels fall down
At the glory of the Lord
And as I hit the ground I see

And I fall down
Afraid and shaking here
And I fall down
Perfectly safe in you

I saw angels fall down
At the glory of the Lord
The hurt and the broken find rest here

I saw angels fall down
At the beauty of the Lord
And as I kneeled I cried to know him

And I fall down
Afraid and shaking here
And I fall down
Perfectly safe in you
I'm perfectly safe in you
I'm perfectly safe in you

Yeah........"
