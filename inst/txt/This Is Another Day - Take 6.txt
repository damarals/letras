Doo ba doo doo
Doo ba doo doo oh
Doo ba doo doo
Doo ba doo doo oh,

Just want to thank you lord,
Thank you for one more day…

This is another day that the lord has kept me
Ooh this is another day he blessed me
He kept me from all evil with my mind stayed on him
And i know he’s gonna keep me ooh-until he returns again (yeah)

This is another day that the lord has kept me
Ooh this is another day he blessed me
He kept me from all evil with my mind stayed on him
And i know he’s gonna keep me ooh-until he returns again (yeah)

Have you ever felt like you couldn’t make it?
You didn’t have the strength to go through
Troubles and trials always got you down
You cry lord what shall i do? (ooh well)

Stop depending on your feelings and start trusting in god’s (his) word
'cuz i’m persuaded he will keep me (he’ll never leave me)
Till i see his face someday (well)
