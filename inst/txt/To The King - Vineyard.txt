"1" "To The King
Vineyard

I will sing of Your love forever
I will lift up my hands
I will sing songs of joy to the King of Kings
You bring freedom within from my struggles
Youre the light of my life
You will come once again with a sound from heaven

Hallelujah to the King who is to come
We raise our voices and declare Your mighty name"
