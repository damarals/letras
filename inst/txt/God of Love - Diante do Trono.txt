Diante do Trono

So much sorrows, so much pain
In this desert, I'm praying for rain
So I surrender all my fear
I can trust you, I know you are here

So much sorrows, so much pain
In this desert, I'm praying for rain
I surrender all my fear
Lord, I trust you, I know you are here

I will remember Your promise
That You will never forget me
I will remember You promise
That You will never forsake me

How good it is to belong to a God of love
How good it is to trust that You are faithful
I will rest in You
I will wait on You
I will worship You, God of love

Awake my soul, arise and sing
Shout for joy and victory
God of love, You're faithful
You never failed, Your love never fails"
