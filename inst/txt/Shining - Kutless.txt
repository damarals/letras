Kutless

Into darkness Love has come
God in flesh Bright as the sun
Light that conquered sin and death
Wrap us in Your righteousness

All we want is to see your holy face
So all we are is your reflection

You are shining
Your glory fills the heavens
You are the light of the world

You are shining
Your glory fills the heavens
You are the light of the world

Lifted high upon the cross
The only way to save the lost
You brought hope to all mankind
And now forever you will shine

Shine upon us
Cause your face to shine upon us"
