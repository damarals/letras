"x"
"1" "There
Leonardo Gon√ßalves

Well, I've heard a million times
In many songs and rhymes
I've witnessed arguments about how it will be

Will it be every living eye
To see Him coming in the sky
And what about the midnight cry, I hear them say

Are the streets like I was told
Are they really made of gold
And will Jerusalem be built where it is now

How can there be a crystal sea
If the sea has ceased to be
All these questions annoy me, I just don't care

Cause I want to be there
I just want to be there
And sit at my Jesus' feet
I wanna be there
I just don't care about the crown
Or the color of the gown
As long as Jesus is in town
I wanna be there

I know there are things in this life that we can't understand
There are moments we tend to forget where we belong
Sure, there's time... Yes, there's wealth in that beautiful place
But all I want is to see Him face to face"
