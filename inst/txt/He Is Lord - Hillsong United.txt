Oh blessed Lamb once slain
Will reign for evermore
His hands once bound now save
Our God will never fail

He is Lord
He is Lord
Sings my soul
He is the Lord
And He lives
Yes He lives
I'm alive
Cause Jesus lives

‘Tis at the cross of Christ
Where earth and heaven meet
Where sin is overcome
To God the victory

He is Lord
He is Lord
Sings my soul
He is the Lord
And He lives
Yes He lives
I'm alive
Cause Jesus lives

And now
Let the earth resound with praise
For our Saviour God He reigns
He is high and lifted up
Arise
For the King of glory waits
He is coming back again
He is coming back again

He is Lord
He is Lord
Sings my soul
He is the Lord
And He lives
Yes He lives
I'm alive
Cause Jesus lives

And now
Let the earth resound with praise
For our Saviour God He reigns
He is high and lifted up
Arise
For the King of glory waits
He is coming back again
He is coming back again
He is coming back again
He is coming back again
He is coming back again
He is coming back again
He is coming back again
He is coming back again
He is coming back again"
