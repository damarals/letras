"1" "Even So Come
Chris Tomlin

All of creation
All of the earth
Make straight a highway
A path for the lord
Jesus is coming soon

Call back the sinner
Wake up the saint
Let every nation
Shout of your fame
Jesus is coming soon

Like a bride
Waiting for her groom
We'll be a church
Ready for you
Every heart longing for our king
We sing
Even so come
Lord Jesus come

There will be justice
All will be new
Your name forever
Faithful and true
Jesus is coming soon

So we wait
We wait for you
God we wait
You're coming soon"
