"1" "The Road
Warren Barfield

Another day, another town
The window rolled down I got the wind blowing on my face
Well every twist every turn another lesson learned
In this thing we call the human race


They say life, is a highway and no one knows what’s around the bend
An adventure is waiting let’s set out and discover it


Oh….
We’re on this road together leaving the past in a cloud of smoke
Headed on to forever as we follow the One who knows this road


Everywhere, everyone is certain to belong
Knowing people lost in a crowd
Oh, my friend come on
there’s no need to be alone
this road is better together I’ve found
Oh the mountains, through valleys
we’ll be taking in the highs and lows
It’s the journey of a lifetime
only God knows where it goes


On this road together leaving the past in a cloud of smoke
Headed on to forever as we follow the One who knows this road
Yeah, This Road


Through the dark night, don’t give up just keep driving
Cause a blue sky is out there over the horizon
They say life is a highway, no one knows what’s around the bend


Oh, We’re on this road together leaving the past in a cloud of smoke
Heading on to forever as we follow the One who knows this road
Together yeah we’re leaving the past in a cloud of smoke
Heading on to forever as we follow the One who knows this road

Oh this road
This road"
