"1" "You Brought Us Out
Gaither Vocal Band

You brought us out

O lord, you brought us from a mighty long way
A mighty long stay in the wilderness
O lord, you brought us through the thick and thin
Through the fire and wind to a better place
You brought us out, to bring us in

All those years longing for a land
We would start, but too weak to stand
And they took their toll. Tyrants of their soul
With no place we could call our own
With no song, lord, you heard our groan
And you made a way, where there was no way

Out of chains and the bonds of man
Out of death, and the curse of sin
Through the desert sand to the promise land"
