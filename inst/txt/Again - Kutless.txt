Kutless

Awakened from a dream again
To a sunrise of Your own
How could I expect any more
From the One who is so pure
Yet You gave up Your life
And You're still giving more
This must imply that

Love again, again, again
I don't deserve this love you give
Love again, again, again
I don't deserve this love you give to me

A fountain flows with gifts from You
That I do nothing for
You cover me with Your love
Though I nailed You to a cross
I don't understand
But I thank You the same
This must imply that

Love again, again, again
I don't deserve this love you give
Love again, again, again
I don't deserve this love you give to me

Love again, again, again
I don't deserve this love you give
Love again, again, again
I don't deserve this love you give to me"
