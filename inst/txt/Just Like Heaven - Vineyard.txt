"1" "Just Like Heaven
Vineyard

You are wonderful, like a dulcet song
You are radiant, shining like the dawn
Like the dawn
You are glorious, shrouded in all splendor
So beautiful, and Your presence is like heaven
Just like heaven...

And as the years go by
Until the day I die
Ill sing holy, holy is the Lord

And from age to age
I will sing God's praise
Singing holy, holy, holy is the Lord
Singing worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lord"
