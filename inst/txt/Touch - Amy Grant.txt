Amy Grant

There's a fire in the sky
The stars are burning
Like this passion tonight
Slowly stirring

You and I
A way we've never known
Now we're here alone

You're the one in my life and
Nothing matters
More to me on this night than
Learning how do I love you
Til the morning light
Baby you and I

Hold me close
Fill me breathe
Touch my heart
Set it free and love will lead us
Lay me down
Lift me up
Feel the power
Every time we touch

Don't we wait all our lives
For such a moment
Soul to soul, eye to eye
And all our colors run
Toward one
Til there's no dividing light
Between you and I

Hold me close
Fill me breathe
Touch my heart
Set it free and love will lead us
Lay me down Lift me up
Feel the power
Every time we touch

Hold onto water
Hold to the tide
Love is an ocean
Love washes over
For you and I
As we dream
On the sea of desire

Hold me close
Fill me breath
Touch my hear
Set me free and love will lead us
Lay me down
Lift me up
Feel the power
Every time we touch

I have waited all my life
For this moment
For this moment
