"1" "Jesus Is The Answer
Michael W. Smith

Jesus is the answer for the world today
Above him there's no other, Jesus is the way
Jesus is the answer for the world today
Above him there's no other, Jesus is the way

If you have some questions in the corners of your mind
And traces of discouragement and peace you can not find
Reflection of the old past, They seem to face you every day
There's one thing I know for sure that Jesus is the way

I know you got mountains that you think you can not climb
I know that your skies have been dark, You think the sun won't shine
In case you don't know, I'm here to tell you that the World of God is true yeah
And everything that He's promised, I tell you he would do it for you
Let me tell you that"
