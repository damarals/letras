Hillsong United

Better than all this world
Better than all I know
Better than life itself
Your love is
All that I have is Yours
All that I'm living for
All that I need is in You lord

You alone are better than life
Than anything in this world
You alone are all I want
In everything You are good
I stand in awe
Of all that You are
I stand in awe of You

Everything unto You
Everything held by You
All of our hope is in You Jesus
Nothing compares to You
Nothing will take Your place
All of our trust is in You lord"
