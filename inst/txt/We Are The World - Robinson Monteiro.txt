"1" "We Are The World
Robinson Monteiro

There comes a times when we need a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There a people dyins
Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somehow will soon make a change
We're all a part of god's great big family
And the truth-you know love is all we need
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Well, send√©m you your heart
So they know that someone cares
And their lives will be estronger and free
As god has shown us
By turning stone to bread
And so we all must lend a helping hand"
