Delirious

I, I want to know you
I want to show you I'm forever yours
And now, another day is dawning
Another page is turning here
For everyone to see

Yes I'm on my knees
'Cause I love you

And when you touch my life
I've been born again,
I am born again
And when you touch my life
I've been born again
I am born again

I'll shine like the heavens
Shine with the words of life
Light up my way
So please deliver me from walking
Beyond the truth that called me here
I'm not ashamed today

I've been torn again,
The curtain's been torn again"
