I must have been good, I must have been right
to see you standing holding, holding tight
with your arms around me, I know that you are there
you're never in the distance, I always know you're near

I must have been good, I must have been right
to see you standing holding, holding tight
with your arms around me, I know that you are there
you're never in the distance, I always know you're near

nothing I can do nothig I can say
can make you love me more, your love remains the same
you gave it all for me, you gladly took my place
to rid myself of all, all my guilt and shame

I must have been strong, I must have stood tight
to yield the thoughtsaround me, that battle in my mind
and knowing you surround me, your wings coat my despair
whatever my condition the cross it shoes you care
