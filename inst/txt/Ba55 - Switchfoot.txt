Switchfoot

I want a fire that could burn me clean
Light the sky with my black eyed dreams
And let my soul fly
And let my soul fly

I want a fire burn down the door
Let the wounds of my embers soar
And let my soul fly
And let my soul fly

Let it go

Pavement beneath my feet
I watch the white lines fly
Nothing between us here, but the black blue sky
Suspended up in the air, like a still life
Suspended up in the air, like a still life

Let it go

I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean"
