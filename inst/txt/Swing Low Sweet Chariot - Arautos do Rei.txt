"1" "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot
Arautos do Rei

Swing low (swing low) sweet chariot
comin' for to carry me home;
Swing low (swing low) sweet chariot
comin' for to carry me home.

Coro:
Swing low (swing low) sweet chariot
comin' for to carry me home;
Swing low (swing low) sweet chariot
comin' for to carry me home.

Well, ya know I took a look over Jordan and what did I see?
comin' for to carry me home;
( Hal - le - lu - jah)
A band of angels comin after me
comin' for to carry me home
Ride the chariot

(Coro)

I'm sometimes up, I'm sometimes down,
comin' for to carry me home;
But still my soul is glory bound,
Comin' for to carry me home

If you get dere before I do
comin' for to carry me home
Tell all my friends I'm comin' too
comin' for to carry me home.

(Coro)

Well. Swing low (swing low) sweet chariot
comin' for to carry me home;
Swing low (swing low) sweet chariot
comin' for to carry me home.(3x)
Mmm!"
