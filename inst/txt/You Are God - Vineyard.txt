"1" "You Are God
Vineyard

You are God of the heavens
And God of the earth
You are God of our Savior's virgin birth
You were God on the cross
And God over hell
You were God before man
And God when he fell

You
You are
You are God
You are God, God, God

You
You are
You are God
You are God, God, God

You are God
In what seems like happenstance
You are God
In every circumstance
You are God
When we fall and God when we stand
You are God
Who holds us in Your hand"
