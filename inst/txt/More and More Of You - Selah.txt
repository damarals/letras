"1" "More and More Of You
Selah

We have had enough of getting everything we want
We are weary of living this life just for us
Oh, forgive us all for seeking your hand and not your face
Come and empty us, father, we are desperate in this place

Holy spirit, fill us with your fire
Give us your desires
Hold us close to you
Holy spirit, give us revelation
Your healing visitation
Nothing else will do
We want more and more
And more and more of you

You have given us so much more than we deserve
You deliver us by the power of your word
So, God we lift you up
Giving you the honour that is yours
Thank you for your love
This is what we are living for

Holy spirit, fill us with your fire
Give us your desires
Hold us close to you
Holy spirit, give us revelation
Your healing visitation
Nothing else will do
We want more and more
And more and more of you

Oh, the love that covers us
Oh, the saviour's mercy
Oh, the blood that makes us spotless white

Oh, the love that covers us
Oh, the saviour's mercy
Oh, the blood that makes us spotless white

Holy spirit, fill us with your fire
Give us your desires
Hold us close to you
Holy spirit, give us revelation
Your healing visitation
Nothing else will do
We want more and more
And more and more of you

Holy spirit, fill us with your fire
Give us your desires
Hold us close to you
Holy spirit, give us revelation
Your healing visitation
Nothing else will do
We want more and more"
