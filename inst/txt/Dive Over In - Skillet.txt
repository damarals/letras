"1" "Dive Over In
Skillet

I thought distinctly
Different from now
Wonder dramatically
All about everything always

All my pushing
Becomes nothing I shake the fear

I used to compensate
For what I couldn't achieve
I conquered dreams
Forgetting what they were

All my pushing
Becomes nothing
All my falling
Is into You

Jump over on (Everybody now)
Dive over in (C'mon yea-yea)
'Cause it's just not enough
To stand at the edge (You gotta dive over in)

Now I am voiceless
Senseless at Your mercy
You draw me wildly
All my remainder

All my pushing
Becomes nothing
All my falling
Is into You

Jump over on
Dive over in
'Cause it's just not enough
To stand at the edge (you gotta dive over in)

All my pushing
Becomes nothing
All my falling
Is into You
Jump over on
Dive over in
'Cause it's just not enough
To stand at the edge (you gotta dive over in)
