MercyMe

Take this world from me
I don't need it anymore.
I am finally free
My heart is spoken for.

Oh and i praise you
Oh and i worship you...

CHORUS:
Covered by your love divine
Child of the risen Lord.
To hear you say \"This one's mine\"
My heart is spoken for.

Now i have a peace
I've never known before.
I find myself complete
My heart is spoken for.

Oh and I praise you
Oh and I worship you...

CHORUS:
Covered by your love divine
Child of the risen Lord
To hear you say \"This one's mine\"
My heart is spoken for.

By the power of the cross
You've taken what was lost
And made it fully yours.
And i have been redeemed
By you that spoke to me
Now i am spoken for

Covered by your love divine
Shout out there is a Lord
To hear you say \"this one's mine\"
My heart is spoken for
2X

Take this world from me
Don't need it anymore...
