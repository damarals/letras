Third Day

Praise the invisible, praise the immortal one
Praise God incarnate, praise father, spirit, son
For he is God, for he is holy
For he holds the keys to the grave
And forever he will reign

Praise the invisible, praise the immortal one
Praise God incarnate, praise father, spirit, son
For he is God, for he is holy
For he holds the keys to the grave
For he is God, for he is holy
For he holds the keys to the grave
And forever he will reign

We lift our hands up higher
We raise our voices louder
To the only wise, eternal king
We lift our hands up higher
We raise our voices louder
Be honor and glory unending"
