No one can break my heart like you
Are you the salt or the stitches for my wounds
Will you just lead me on or will you pull me through
No one can break my heart like you
And I cannot explain why I love the way

You can take me high or tear me down so low
Every word you say flies trough this heart of mine like an arrow
You can spark a fire deep inside my bones
Every move you make strikes every part of me like an arrow

Coming at me like an arrow
No one can break your heart like me
Will I carry you to safety or drag you out to sea
Am I your medication or just your disease
No one can break your heart like me
And you cannot explain why you love the way

I can take you high or tear you down so low
Every word I say flies trough this heart of yours like an arrow
I can spark a fire deep inside your bones
Every move I make strikes every part of you like an arrow
Coming at you like an arrow

No one can break my heart like you
No one can take me high like you
No one can light me up or burn me down like you do
And I cannot explain why I love the way

You can take me high when I'm down so low
Every word you say flies trough this heart of mine like an arrow
You can spark a fire deep inside my bones
Every move you make strikes every part of me like an arrow

You can take me high or tear me down so low
You can spark a fire deep inside my bones
Like an arrow"
