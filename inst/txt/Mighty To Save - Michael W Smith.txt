"1" "Mighty To Save
Michael W. Smith

Everyone needs compassion
A love that's never falling
Let mercy fall on me
Everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Saivor
The hope of nations

Savior, He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save
He is mighty to save
Forever, Author of salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave
So take me as you find me
All of my tears and failures
And fill my life again
I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in
Now I surrender

Shine Your light and let the whole world sing
We're singing for the glory of the Risen King Jesus
(2x)"
