"1" "Might Have Ben Hur
Switchfoot

Everything I know
Tells me she's everything
That I could hope for
Everything I know
Tells me I can't let her
Walk away

I took my time to find the words
I hoped she'd feel the same

'Cause I want someone to
Share my smile
To share the pain
To be there when the sea
Turns gray

To share the joy
For better or worse

And I thought that it
Might have been her

Wonder if she knows
The way I saw her soul
Light up my life
Wonder if she knows
Of the pain I feel tonight
