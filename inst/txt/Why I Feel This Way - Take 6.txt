"1" "Why I Feel This Way
Take 6

When I feel a summer breeze
And I hear it as it whispers through the trees
Well it causes my heart to fly
Gliding like an eagle through the sky
And I know Your love is why I feel this way

Just behold a newborn child
If devoid of Your love I would never see that smile
On this miracle holiday
I am overwhelmed with Your display
And I know Your love is why I feel this way

Beauty in this world
Often hard to see
Found in little things
Close to you and me
When I let this love into my heart
With a new point of view I can start
By Your love I can see the way things were meant to be

With Your love and by Your will
I am forever warm within my heart through winter's chill
And when snow falls from the sky
Chystal images of love go by
And I know Your love is why I feel this way
And I know Your love is why I feel this way

Close to you and me
When I let this love into my heart
With a new point of view I can start
By Your love I can see the way things were meant to be

Repeat last verse"
