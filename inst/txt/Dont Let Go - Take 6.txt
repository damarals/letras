"1" "Don't Let Go
Take 6

When something brings pain to your life
And everything's wrong that was right
And you can't find the strength to stand
Oh no, don't let go
Don't let go of my hand

You struggle for something to say
When someone you love passes away
And it's something you can't understand
Don't let go
Don't let go of my hand

And I will be right here
Like you've always known
And I'll be there wherever you go
And when you're in need of my love
You can always come home
Come on home

You walk through this cold world alone
Nothing to call your own, no
And suplly's in shorter demand
Oh yeah, don't let go

*Don't let go, oh
Don't let go, oh
Just wipe the tears from your eyes
Ease the pain
Erase all the hurt inside

*repeat"
