P.O.D.

Today I heard what dem a people say /
Dem want to live free, greedy, and don't care who pays /
You play under the sun, while others fight in the skies of gray /
I say if you don't like it this way, then why stay, go away!

CHORUS:
Freedom fighters / Ignite Jah /Freedom fighters / Shine Jah
(Live free, be free, die free)


Today i heard what dem a people say /
Dem say the man came in and took our choice away /
You portray selfishness and hate, while some prepare to die today /
I say you'll fade away, appreciate the life and liberate

CHORUS:
Freedom fighters / Ignite Jah /Freedom fighters / Shine Jah
(Live free, be free, die free)


BRIDGE:
We have the right to live in peace /
And you must fight for what you keep /
If what you keep holds truth inside/
Stand up, defend or lay down and die


CHORUS:
Freedom fighters / Ignite Jah /Freedom fighters / Shine Jah
(Live free, be free, die free)
