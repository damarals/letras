"1" "Kyrie Eleison
Chris Tomlin

Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
Hear our cry and heal our land
Let kindness lead us to repentance
Bring us back again

For Your Name is great and Your heart is grace
Kyrie Eleison
Over all You reign, You alone can save
Kyrie Eleison
Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy on us now
(2x)

Who is this God who pardons all our sin?
So ready to forgive, You delight to show your mercy
Who is this God who pardons all our sin
So ready to forgive, You delight to show your mercy
(2x)

For Your Name is great and Your heart is grace
Kyrie Eleison
Over all You reign, You alone can save
Kyrie eleison
(2x)

Lord have mercy (Lord have mercy)
Christ have mercy (Christ have mercy)
Lord have mercy (Lord have mercy)
Christ have mercy on us now"
