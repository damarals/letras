Vineyard

Oh Lord most high
Plant Your Word in my heart
That I may not be shaken
Be my Æ’Orm foundation
All the days of my life
All the days of my life

I will follow You
I will follow You
I will follow You
I will follow You

Through every kind of trial I face
Form wisdom in my heart by Your grace
May revelation open the eyes
Of my heart"
