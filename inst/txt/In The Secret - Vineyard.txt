"x"
"1" "In The Secret
Vineyard

In the secret, in the quiet place
In the stillness You are there
In the secret, in the quiet hour I wait only for You
'Cause I want to know you more

(chorus)
I want to know You
I want to hear Your voice
I want to know You more
I want to touch You
I want to see Your face
I want to know You more

I'm reaching for the highest goal
That I might receive the prize
Pushing every hindrance awside out of my way
'Cause I want to know You more"
