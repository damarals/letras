"1" "Incredible God/praise
Youthful Praise

I've had some problems
Some great and some small
You being God delivered me from them all
Still can't believe
All the ways You made
An incredible God deserves incredible praise

What kind of God would do this for me?
Victory, grace and mercy
He is so special, simply incredible
So incredible
An incredible God deserves incredible praise

Praise, incredible
Praise, incredible
Praise, He deserves
Incredible praise

Hallelujah, Lord we love You
Lord we bless You
He's incredible

He's a Healer, He's a Keeper
Lord we love You
He's incredible

He's incredible (repeat)

An incredible God deserves incredible praise."
