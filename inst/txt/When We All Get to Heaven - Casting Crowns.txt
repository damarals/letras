"1" "When We All Get to Heaven
Casting Crowns

Sing the wondrous love of Jesus
Sing His mercy and His grace
In the mansions bright and blessed
He'll prepare for us a place

When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory!

Will the toils of life repay
Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we'll behold
Soon the pearly gates will open
We shall tread the streets of gold"
