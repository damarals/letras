"1" "Psalm 104
Amy Grant

Oh, Lord, how many are thy works!
In wisdom thou hast made them all.
The earth is full of thy possessions.
There is the sea, great and broad
In which are swarms
Without number.
Animals,
Both great and small.
Oh, Lord,
Thou hast made them all.
In which are swarms
Without number.
Animals,
Both great and small.
Oh, Lord,
Thou hast made them all.
