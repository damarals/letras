"1" "Who is Right?
P.O.D.

I'm just a loc'd out brother coming straight from S.D.
Just another islander, beaner, wop, minority
Taught to love one another, all races
All types of colors, different skin, different faces
Can you answer my question when I ask you who is right?
Racist come in all forms of colors Black or White
So take what when I say your hatred Sucks
Coming from the H-I-T man so What's up?
If you ain't down with my white brother,
We ain't down with you
And if you ain't down with my black brother,
Then we ain't down with you
Punk, Punk, Talking that trash
White trash, Black trash, you get a back to back slap
You think I'm soft, then you don't know me
Cause no I don't play that and we're definitely not your Homie
He'll take your pride for a long ride, try and hide
You hate my outside, how bout my inside
It's just me and my boys and we'll hit em up
So bring it on holmes, and we could get em up
Yeah come on y'all, get em up
One for peace, two for love, and three for my G-O-D
Yeah, come on y'all get em up
Get your hands up
One for peace, two for love, and three for my G-O-D
Now that's dread to you head for my final conclusion
Straight up Acts 10 Holmes, It's Peter's vision
So, get up Peter, Kill and Eat
Surely not Lord this meat is unclean
For my Lord makes nothing unclean
Creatures of the World all Beasts and Human Beings
Black or White who is right?
Peace and Love throught my Lord, Jesus Christ!
Then Peter began to speak,
I now realize how God does not show favortism,
But accepts man from every nation who fear him
And do what is right
Black or White, Who is Right?
