"1" "Once and for All
Lauren Daigle

God I give You all I can today
These scattered ashes that I hid away
I lay them all at Your feet


From the corners of my deepest shame
The empty places where I've worn Your name
Show me the love I say I believe


O Help me to lay it down
O Lord I lay it down


O let this be Where I die
My lord with thee Crucified
Be lifted high As my Kingdom fall
Once and for all, Once and for all


There is victory in my Saviors loss
and In the crimson flowing from the cross
Pour over me, Pour over me


O let this be Where I die
My lord with thee Crucified
Be lifted high As my Kingdom fall
Once and for all, Once and for all


O Lord I lay it down
O Lord I lay it down
Help me to lay it down
O Lord I lay it down


O let this be Where I die
My lord with thee Crucified
Be lifted high As my Kingdom fall
Once and for all


Once and for all


O Once and for all


Once and for all"
