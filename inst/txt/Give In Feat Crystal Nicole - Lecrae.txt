"1" "Give In (Feat. Crystal Nicole)
Lecrae

I'm giving it all away
No more hiding
No more stalling
I hear you callin' me
And I'm coming
See me running
I give in (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
You win (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
I give in (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
You win (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)

I tried but I just can't keep this thing to myself
Looked high and low,
and I know ain't nobody else
But I'm focused now and I know it's all about you
You always see me through that's what you do
Tell me
Tell me, where would I go where would I be?
Love's hard to find
When you blind and losing your way
And now ain't nobody else for me, it's just you
You got my time, all the time,
everytime, my mind is on you

I'm giving it all away
No more hiding
No more stallin'
I hear you callin' me
And I'm coming
See me running
I give in (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
You win (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
I give in (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
You win (uh oh oh, uh oh oh

They laugh at me and they say
I'm going too far
But it's satisfying my soul to give you my all
They don't understand what I got is so real
They can talk about me, they can kick me out
But can't take away what you give
People telling me that I'm probably
too far gone
But they don't understand where I been
and ain't walked the roads that I've walked on
Tell me who I'm gone call on
What solid ground can I fall on
You are everything that I never dreamed
and you give me and it's all on you
You know you got me deep off in this thing
I'm all in
I swear ain't no love
Like this love that I've been given
I can't resist it's just too much
Your love is endless
And I don't care what they say no more
No way, I'm giving in

It's time to cut the cord
Sever the ties from the life before
From here on out I'm yours
I can't run no more
Cause you're pulling me in
Like a tornado wind
And I can't pretend
I tried leaving
But your love is so strong
And it won't let go
You're holding on to me

I'm giving it all away
No more hiding
No more stallin'
I hear you callin' me
And I'm coming
See me running
I give in (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
You win (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
I give in (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
You win (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)"
