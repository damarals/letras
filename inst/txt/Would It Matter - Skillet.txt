"x"
"1" "Would It Matter
Skillet

(Verse 1)
if I wasn't here tomorrow would anybody care
if my time was up I'd wanna know
You were happy I was there

if I wasn't here tomorrow would anyone lose sleep
if I wasn't hard and hollow
Then maybe you would miss me

(Pre Chorus)
I know I'm a mess and I wanna be someone
Someone that I'd like better
I can never forget, so don't remind me of it
forever

(Chorus)
What if I just pulled myself together
Would it matter at all
What if I just tried not to remember
Would it matter at all
All the chances that have passed me by
Would it matter if I gave it one more try
Would it matter at all

(Verse 2)
if I wasn't here tomorrow would anybody care
Still stuck inside this sorrow
I got nothin? and going nowhere

(Post bridge)
I know I'm a mess and I wanna be someone
Someone that I'd like better
Can you help me forget, don't wanna feel like this
forever

If I left tomorrow would anybody care
Stuck in this sorrow
Going nowhere"
