"1" "Whenever I Fall
MÃºsicas Gospel

I place all my faith
In the man up above.
And when I'm deserving,
I experience his love.

He helps guide my life,
And I'm trusting in him.
He lights up the darkness
When everything looks dim.

It seems he's waiting
Whenever I call.
And he's there for me
Whenever I fall.

I know his love is true
'Cause it's shown to me.
And when my life's over,
He knows where I pray to be.

It seems he's waiting,
Whenever I call.
And he's there for me
When-ever I fall."
