MercyMe

This is not my home.
This is not my space.
Simple not my style.
This is not my place.
Cant get comfortable.
Cant get settled in.

I simply dont belong Cant get used to this
But im here right now.
I can hear You say ''Make the most of me''
This wont go to waste.
If Im out of my mind yeah.
Its all for the Christ.
If Im making sense then get in line.
Every moment is a chance to let your light break through.

This life,this life was meant to shine.
This life,this life was meant to shine.

I dont have to stall.
I dont have to wait.
Dont have to bide my time.
Till I make my escape.
'Cause heaven's in my heart .
I wont seetle for less.
I will lift Your name by the life I live.
Every moment is a chance to let your light break through.
This life,this life was meant to shine.
This life,this life was meant to shine."
