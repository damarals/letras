Vineyard

Though the storms of life may swell
You will be Emmanuel
Ever present ever near
Perfect love to cast out fear

Lo behold this soul has found
My death my shame lie in the ground
No more to bind this ransomed heart
You died for me
You died for me

Fortune is no friend of mine
Earthly treasures pass me by
But my reward shall always be
To walk with You and You with me

Emmanuel, God with us, here with us
Emmanuel, Prince of peace, Son of God

(Repeat)

Emmanuel, Emmanuel, Emmanuel, Emmanuel"
