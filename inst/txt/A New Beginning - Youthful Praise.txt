A New Beginning
by New Birth Total Praise Choir (Bishop Eddie Long)
Written by Kevin Bond
from CD: A New Beginning
Yesterday is gone
And tomorrow is new
Everything that's gone undone
Now its time for you to do
Look forward to a brighter day
And a great expected end
It's a new day and a new beginning
It's a new day and a new beginning
(Repeat)
Behold I'll do a new thing
Much more than the eye has ever seen
Behold I'll do it, I'll do it in you, in you
Your future(s) now at hand
Time to get in the fight
Work while its is day
So you can rest throughout the night
A blessing now receive
And a reward in the end
It's a new day and a new beginning
It's a new day and a new beginning
Behold I'll do a new thing
Much more than the eye has ever seen
Behold I'll do it, I'll do it in you, in you
(Repeat 2xs)
Altos:
Begin again, begin again, begin again,
Start all over again
Tenors:
My future, my blessing, my promise,
My reward
Star all over again
Sopranos:
Yesterday's gone, tomorrow is new,
Today(s) the gift I have so I will
Start all over again
All:
My future, my blessing, my promise,
My reward
Star all over again
All:
Begin again, begin again, begin again,
Start all over again
Begin again, begin again, begin again"
