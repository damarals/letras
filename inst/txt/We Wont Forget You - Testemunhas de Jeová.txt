"1" "We Won't Forget You
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

When the wind blows
When the rain comes
When the ground beneath you starts to slip away

God is always near
And he cares for you
You're not alone
Your friends are here
We'll help you find your way

We won't forget you
We are your family
We won't ignore you
We will not fail to see

We'll take your hand
We'll help you stand
We'll help you carry on
We won't forget you
We are your family

When the storm's gone
When the day breaks
When our love surrounds you like a warm embrace
Then you come to know
That it's really so
Love is a bond
A perfect bond
That time will not erase

We won't forget you
We are your family
We won't ignore you
We will not fail to see
We'll take your hand
We'll help you stand

We'll help you carry on
We won't forget you
We are a worldwide family
We won't forget you
We are your family"
