Vineyard

We come with expectation
It's Your glory we long for
And we come with hearts wide open
Come invade this place, Oh Lord

We can see that You're moving here
Lord, we long for Your kingdom to reign
So come and heal our hearts with waves of mercy
'Cause we need more, we need more of You, Lord

You are comfort for the broken
There is healing in Your name
Let the God who filled the oceans
Flood into our hearts today

We need more, we need more
We need more of You Lord

We need more, we need more
We need more of You Lord
We need more, we need more
We need more of You Lord"
