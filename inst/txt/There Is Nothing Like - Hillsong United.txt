Hillsong United

(Verse 1)
Father true and merciful
Bound to me with love
Adopted in free from all sin

Jesus Saviour glorified
Your offering none could give
I stand before You humbled and in awe

(Pre-Chorus)
And all
To You God
For all You are to me

(Chorus)
There is nothing like
There is nothing like
Your Love.. Your Love

(Verse 2)
Holy Spirit gift of God
Teach my soul to soar
Train me in Your Holy ways oh Lord

(Pre-Chorus)
(Chorus)

(Bridge)
I love you forever
I love you forever
I love you forever Lord

(Pre-Chorus)
(Chorus)
