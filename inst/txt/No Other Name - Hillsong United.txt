Hillsong United

One name holds weight above them all
His fame outlasts the earth he formed
His praise resounds beyond the stars
And echoes in our hearts
The greatest one of all

His face shines brighter than the sun
His grace as boundless as his love
He reigns with healing in his wings
The king above all kings
The greatest one of all

Lift up our eyes see the king has come
Light of the world reaching out for us
There is no other name
There is no other name
Jesus Christ, our God

Seated on high the undefeated one
Mountains bow down as we lift him up
There is no other name
There is no other name
Jesus Christ, our God

Find hope when all the world seems lost
Behold the triumph of the cross
His power has trampled death and grave
Our life found in his name
The greatest name of all

The earth will shake
And tremble before him
Chains will break as heaven and earth sing
Holy is the name
Holy is the name of Jesus
Jesus, Jesus"
