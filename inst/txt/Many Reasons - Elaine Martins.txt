"1" "Many Reasons
Elaine Martins

How holy you are
Marvelous
God of Goodness
And all powerful

I have so many reasons to say
That I love you
There are so many reasons to say
That I love you

How holy you are
Marvelous
God of Goodness
And all powerful

I want to feel you
I want to touch you
I will follow you
And adore you

I have so many reasons to say
That I love you
There are so many reasons to say
That I love you

Oh how you suffered
'Til the cross
You rose up from death
So I may live

I want to feel you
I want to touch you
I will follow you
And adore you

I have so many reasons to say
That I love you
There are so many reasons to say
That I love you

I have so many reasons to say
That I love you
There are so many reasons to say
That I love you

I love you
I love you"
