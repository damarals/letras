"1" "Open The Eyes Of My Heart
Diante do Trono

Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You

Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You

{Chorus}
To see you high and lifted up
Shining in the light of Your glory
Pour out Your power and love
As we sing holy, holy, holy

{Chorus}

Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy
I want to see You

Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You

{Chorus}

Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy
I want to see You"
