Patience, Love, Kind, Love, Sweet, Love, Kind, Love
Patience, Love, Kind, Love, Sweet, Love, Kind, Love

Love
A word that comes and goes
But few people really know
What it means to really
Love somebody

Love
Though the tears may fade away
I'm so glad your love can stay
'Cause I love you
And you show me Jesus
What it really means to love

The nights that I cried You loved me
When I should have died You loved me
I'll never know why you love
It's a mistery to me now
I'm glad to see, Jesus

When all hope was gone You love me
You game me a song that You loved me
Now I can go on 'cause You love me
It's a mistery to me now
I'm glad to see, Jesus
What it really means to love...

Patient, kind... that's love"
