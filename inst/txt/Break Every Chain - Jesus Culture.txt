Jesus Culture

There is power in the name of jesus
There is power in the name of jesus
There is power in the name of jesus
To break every chain
To break every chain
To break every chain

All sufficient sacrifice
So freely given
Such a price bought
Our redemption

Heaven's gates swing wide
There's an army rising up
There's an army rising up
There's an army rising up
There's an army rising up
To break every chain
To break every chain"
