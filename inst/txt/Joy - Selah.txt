Selah

Every breath of air was a silent prayer
I was longing for Your face
And I wondered why all the years went by
Without a single trace

Anticipating, Lord we’ve been waiting
Just watching the days come and go
But now we know

Joy
And the angels sang joy
Let the whole world know this
Joy
Our King has finally come
Joy
Here is the promised One

Set the captives free
Tell the broken reed
Hope has been restored
And the one who cries
For a wandering child
Her tears are not ignored

Father in heaven
You gave us reason to see past
The pain of today
We celebrate

chorus

Unending hope for all time
When the King of the ages arrived

chorus

We’ve waited so long for today
We saw the signs
The One the Father sent to save
We’ve seen with our own eyes"
