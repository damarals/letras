"1" "Savior's Here
Kari Jobe

You bring hope
You bring life
Awaken hearts open eyes
With our voices hidden eyes
We call these dry bones to come alive
You are faithful you are truth
We can always run to

Pre-Chorus:
Love that never fails
Arms that never close
Blood with cover sin
Grace that never ends

Chorus:
You have saved us
You have won
City's Broken
Death is gone
Freedom's father's
Breakthrough's near
In your presence
No more Fear
Our savior's here
Our savior's here

Faith is sturring
Hearts are free
Chains are broken and we believe
You are mighty you come through
We can always run to

Pre-chorus

Chorus
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Our God Save
