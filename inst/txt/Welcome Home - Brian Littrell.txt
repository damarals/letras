Brian Littrell

When I left home to be who I am
Some people said, \"no way\"
But I laid it all down
Gave everything
In my head rang the words
That my father said

You're never far
I will be where you are
And when you come to me
I will open my arms

Welcome home you
I know you by name
How do you do
I shine because of you today
So come and sit down
Tell me how you are
I know son, it's good just to see your face

When i look at you
Holding my heart
I give to you all that i have
Son I know, there'll be times that
You'll feel all alone
I will share with you
The words my father said

You are never far
I will be where you are
And when you come to me
You can bet i will open my arms

Welcome home you
I know you by name
How do you do
I shine because of you today
So come and sit down
Tell me how you are
I know son, it's good just
To see your face

See I've been waiting for that day
Just to feel your warm embrace
Your love has shown
I will never be alone
For you will welcome me home

I'll forever be
For you will say to me
Welcome home you

I know you by name
How do you do
I shine because of you today
So come and sit down
Tell me how you are
I know son, it's good just to see your face

When I left home to be who I am
Some people said \"no way\""
