P.O.D.

Go! Get on your mark and just get ready to go. (go!)
Get out my way because you're moving to slow. (go!)
I'm in a hurry! This is my life! Live fast, die young
And I don't care about it!

Go! I'm way too high on the highway. (go!)
There ain't nobody going my way. (go!)
I'm on the edge headed straight to a dead end, screaming
I'm living life in the fast lane!

I am burning down the lines
Ignoring all the signs again cause I'm a speed demon
While I'm swerving to an end. It's me against the world
Again cause I'm a speed demon

Go! I'm taking off like a bat out of hell. (go!)
I get so lost that I can't even tell (go!)
Which way is what? (what?)
I'm going under but I already told ya

I-I don't care about it!
Go! All alone. Out-out of control! (go!)
I'm so numb that I don't even know. (go!)
I'm on the edge headed straight to a dead end, screaming
I'm living life in the fast lane!

I am burning down the lines
Ignoring all the signs again cause I'm a speed demon
While I'm swerving to an end. It's me against the world
Again cause I'm a speed demon

I want what I want what I want, want when I want it!
I need what I need what I need when I need it!

I'm on the edge headed straight to a dead end, screaming
I'm living life in the fast lane!"
