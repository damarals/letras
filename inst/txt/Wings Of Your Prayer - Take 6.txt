"1" "Wings Of Your Prayer
Take 6

When your night is long
When it all goes wrong
I will take your hand and help you be strong

Should you start to fall
Should you lose it all
I will come to your side when you call

Just remember
I'll fly on the wings of your prayer

There's a (bright) silver lining
Just behind the (darkest of) clouds
You will find the sun's still shining
If you let your faith show you how

When the winds blow cold
And they chill your soul
I will reach out my arms to hold

Just remember
There's someone who cares
When you need me I'll always be there

Just remember
I'll fly on the wings of your prayer

When your road seems far
For you burdened heart
When you wish at night upon the stars
Just remember
There's someone who cares
When you need me I'll always be there

Just remember
I'll fly on the wings of your prayer"
