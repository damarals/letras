P.O.D.

Chorus
Babylon Breathe Babylon

I see you people babylon and on and on
Graven images, golden idols and false icons
I'm seeking wisdom like Solomon
But my antenae keeps on picking up evil transmissions
At headquarters I receive my mission
Blow up the ruler of the air like nuclear fission
So I analyze my weapons, laser guided rifles that shoot spiritual wisdom
I think I see enemy warriors,
Fragile heathens tryin' to run stuff like mayors
So with brotha's that snuff punks,
I set up time bombs to destroy the strong holds of Babylon

Babylon Breathe Babylon
8x

We be tribes under grace, a righteous minority
Decadent culture make you forget your spiritual priority
Back down by the movement, soldiers who will serve ya
Open to be used by God, destroy you like Medo-Persia
Jewel of all kingdoms, live evil, purified Hurrah take you down
Don't look back, overthrown you like Sodom and Gomorrah arm of the law
Guilty of all crimes I be like the great Prophet Isiah
Predict your fall over 150 times, got rhymes you could never use
For the purpose you be using, I'll dance over your fields
Present day Iraq still lies in ruins lies,
Schemes, backstab persuasions bumrushed
Get crushed by us, this rescue invasion

Chorus
8x

Look to the sky, heed the warning
The shadow is coming, the shadow is coming
8x

The plagues are coming, the plagues are coming
I feel the breath of the Death Beast
4x

Misled bureaucracy, full of hypocrisy
I gotta steel pulse, looking for a true democracy
Destruction, now your walls have fallen
Just sitting here waiting for the train to Zion

Sit down in the dust, Babylon without a throne to call your own is 47:1
The city has fallen, she has fallen golden images of it's god
Lie shattered on the ground
