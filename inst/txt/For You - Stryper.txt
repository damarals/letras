"x"
"1" "For You
Stryper

Verse 1:
I would walk through the fire for you
I would fly even higher for you
My one and only desire is you
But will you ever want me?

Chorus:
I can give you the stars, I can give you the oceans
I can give the sun and the moon with a view
I can give you the world with undying devotion
But if I lose your heart, then what good will it do

Verse 2:
I'd run a million miles for you
I'd take on any trial for you
I'd fight any battle and I would die for you
But will you ever know me?

Chorus:
I can give you the stars, I can give you the oceans
I can give the sun and the moon with a view
I can give you the world with undying devotion

I will walk through the fire

Chorus:
I can give you the stars, I can give you the oceans
I can give the sun and the moon with a view
I can give you the world with undying devotion
But if I lose your heart
