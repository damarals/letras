"1" "Have Faith In God
Hillsong United

Oh Lord You lead me
By the still waters
Quietly restoring my soul
You speak words of wisdom
The promise of the glory
The power of the presence of God

Chorus:
Have faith in God
Let your hope rest on the faith
He has placed in your heart
Never give up, never let go of the faith
He has placed in your heart

Verse 2:
Oh Lord You guide me
Through all the darkness
Turning my nights into day
And You'll never leave me
Never forsake me
The power of the presence of God"
