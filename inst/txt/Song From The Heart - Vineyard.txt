"1" "Song From The Heart
Vineyard

Here we are
We've set aside this time to bless Your heart
Different people joined together in one voice
Giving all we have to bless Your heart
Every creature cries out to the one who sits on high
Holy, worthy, magnified

Calling out,
Crying out a sound to please Your ear
A song from our hearts
Calling out,
Crying out a sound to bring You near
A song from our hearts

In the name of, in the name of Jesus"
