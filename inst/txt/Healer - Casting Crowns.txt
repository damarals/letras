Casting Crowns

It's hard to see the storm blowing over anytime soon
Its hard to hear any hope
in the headlines or how to know what's true
We've been trusting in the broken to make us whole
But theres no new rescue coming
it's still the one we've always known

We need the healer
We don't need another hero
We need the healer
Deep down every hurting heart knows
We need the healer
And only Jesus is the healer

The whole world's looking for something
but what we need is someone (Need is someone)
And every road leads back to one name
when all the searching is done
'Cause there's no world view, no religion
that can make the blind eyes see
Let the eyes of our heart be opened to the healing that we need

We need the healer
We don't need another hero
We need the healer
Deep down every hurting heart knows
We need the healer
And only Jesus is the healer
(Youre the healer)

More than comfort, we need the king
More than gifts, we need the giver
More than blessings, we need Your presence
More than the healing, we need the healer
More than comfort, we need the king
More than gifts, we need the giver
More than blessings, we need Your presence
More than the healing, we need the healer
More than comfort, we need the king
More than gifts, we need the giver
More than blessings, we need Your presence
More than the healing

We need the healer
We dont need another hero
We need the healer
Deep down every hurting heart knows
We need the healer
'Cause only Jesus is the healer
Yes, we need the, yes, we need the healer (We need the healer)
No other name but Jesus is the healer (Yes, we need the healer)
Come now Jesus, be the healer
The healer"
