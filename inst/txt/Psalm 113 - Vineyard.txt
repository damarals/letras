"1" "Psalm 113
Vineyard

Let the name of the Lord be praised
Let the name of the Lord be praised
Let the name of the Lord be praised
Right now

Let the name of the Lord be praised
Let the name of the Lord be praised

Right now
And forevermore
Right now
And forevermore

From the rising of the sun
To the place where it goes down

The name of the Lord is to be praised [repeat]"
