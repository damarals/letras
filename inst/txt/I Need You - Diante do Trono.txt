"1" "I Need You
Diante do Trono

I need You Lord
Embrace me and heal me
I need you Lord
Restore me, forgive me

As the deer thirsts for the waters
I long for your love
In a dry and weary land, here I am
I need you Lord

My life is not worth living without you
You are the reason I live
My heart longs for You so desperately
More than the air that I breathe

I need You Jesus
I need you Saviour
I need you forever
I need You"
