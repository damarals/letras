"1" "Mezzanine Floor
Delirious

I'm on the mezzanine floor,
Never been here before no no
It's a lonely place,
But a house full of grace

And I'll get to heaven
Yes, I'll get to heaven

I'm at this bolted door, but I'm
Coming through without permission
If I go they say I'm wrong,
If I stay there'll be no song

And I'll get to heaven
Yes, I'll get to heaven"
