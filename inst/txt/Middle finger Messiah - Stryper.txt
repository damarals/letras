Middle Finger Messiah

He's our salvation
He's our life line
He's is the one worthy king

Before our creation
Beginning of time
He's worn the crown and the ring

(Pre Chorus)
Creator - Maker
The world needs You now
More than ever!

(Chorus)
He came not to bring
Peace but a sword
Paid a ransom only
God could afford
The world flips him off
Like a Pariah
He's The Middle Finger Messiah
The Middle Finger Messiah

He's more than a man
More than than just words
He is the door and the key

The rock and the sand
One of The Third
The bail that will set us all free

(Pre-Chorus)
Pastor - Master
The world needs You now
More than ever!

(Last Pre Chorus)
Creator - Maker
The universe needs You forever!"
