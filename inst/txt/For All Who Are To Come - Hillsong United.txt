"1" "For All Who Are To Come
Hillsong United

Since we are surrounded
By such a great crowd of witnesses
Let us run
Let us run with perseverance
The race marked out
Let us make a way
For those who are to come
Those who are to come

Every generation
Every nation
Every tribe
Every tongue
They will sing
They will pray
That the world would sing...

Hosanna"
