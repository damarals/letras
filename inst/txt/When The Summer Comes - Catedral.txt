"1" "When The Summer Comes
Catedral

When the summers comes
I want to be stronger than I am
Without fear in my eyes
No reason to cry

When the summer comes
The raising sun appears for everyone
A reason to forgive
To live, we need to live

Come, don't stop to dream about
With god in our heart
The dream is more than reality
With you I'm more than I can say
And I need you so much
For ever by muy
When the summer comes
The raising sun appears for everyone
A reason to forgive
And all we needs is just to be free"
