"1" "As It Is (In Heaven)
Hillsong United

Whether now or then
Death is not my end
I know heaven waits for me
Though the road seems long
I'll never walk alone
I've got all I need to sing

I know you love me
I know you found me
I know you saved me
And your grace will never fail me
And while I'm waiting
I'm not waiting
I know heaven lives in me

Should I suffer long
This is not my home
I know heaven waits for me

Though the night is dark
Heaven owns my heart
I've got all I need to sing

So I will sing like I will there
In the fearless light of glory
Where the darkness cannot find me
And your face is all I see
I will sing like a man
With no sickness in my body
Like no prison walls can hold me
I will sing like I am free

I'll sing holy holy
My heart cries holy
As it is in heaven
It is in me

We'll sing holy holy
The earth cries holy
As it is in heaven
So let it be"
