Red

Let it die
Sick of all the promises you've broken
(you break them all)
I get all the blame and you're the victim (it's all a lie)
How long will you hold on
Why can I let it go
Find a way to escape all the hate

If we only could get over
All the pain inside
Al the wasted pride
If we only, if we only
Could just face the truth
Give up the fight
And let it die

Tell me why you drown me with your silence
(you make me sick)
Tell me why I'm always craving violence
(tell me why)
How long will I hold on
Why can't you let it go
Find a way to escape
All the hate

If we only could get over
All the pain inside
Al the wasted pride
If we only, if we only
Could just face the truth
Give up the fight
And let it die

Let it die

I'm done with this
I'm done with this
I'm done with this

If we only could get over
All the tears we've cried
All the wasted pride
If we only, if we only
Could just face the truth
Give up the fight
And let it die (2X)

Let it die!"
