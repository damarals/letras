Newsboys

Dull as dirt
you can't assert
the kinda light that might persuade
a strict dictator to retire
fire the army,
teach the poor origami
the truth is in
the proof is when you hear your heart start asking
What's my motivation?
And try as you may
there isn't a way
to explain the kinda change
that would make an eskimo renounce fur
that would make a vegetarian barbeque hamster
unless you can trace this about-face to a certain sign

shine
make em wonder whatcha got
make em wish that they were not
on the outside looking bored
shine
let it shine before all men
let em see good works and then
let em glorify the lord

Out of the shaker and onto the plate
it isn't karma it sure ain't fate
that would make a deadhead sell his van
that would make a schizophrenic turn in his crayons
Oprah freaks
and science seeks
a rationale that shall excuse this strange behavior
when you let it shine
you will inspire the kind of entire turnaround
that would make a bouncer take ballet
even bouncers who arent happy
but out of the glare
with nowhere to turn
you ain't gonna learn it on \"What's my Line?\"

Shine
make em wonder whatcha got
make em wish that they were not
on the outside looking bored
shine
let it shine before all men
let em see good works and then
let em glorify the lord
