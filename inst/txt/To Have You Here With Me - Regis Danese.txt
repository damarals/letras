"1" "To Have You Here With Me
Regis Danese

Just like Zaccheus, I want to climb
To the highest that I can find
To look at your face
To gaze upon you
In the hope that you’d turn your eyes to me
I need you more than life my Lord
I need you more than life, my Father
I am so very small
But I give you my all
Leave it all to follow you

(Refrão)
Come into my house, come into my life
Knock me down and make me over
Heal my bruised and broken heart
Teach me to live in Holiness
To love you more than all
And so my treasure from now on
Is to have you here with me (2x)"
