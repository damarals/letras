Third Day

Turn on the spotlight, strike up the band
Everyone’s looking my way
They came to see the excitement firsthand
And hear all that I’ve got to say

Oh, it makes me wonder What if I slip, will they catch me
Or watch me fall?

I am walking on a wire
I tiptoe in through the fire
Never looking down to see that
I am walking on a wire
The pressure’s getting higher
But I don’t look around

Everyone roots for the winner
The others well maybe next time
Your time at the top only lasts fifteen minutes
Then they just leave you behind

Oh, it makes me wonder What if I slip, will they catch me
Or watch me fall?

I am walking on a wire
I tiptoe in through the fire
Never looking down to see that
I am walking on a wire
The pressure’s getting higher
But I don’t look around
It’s so far to the ground"
