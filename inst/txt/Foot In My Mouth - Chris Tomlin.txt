"1" "Foot In My Mouth
Chris Tomlin

I saw Mrs. Parker at the store today,
she was buyin' some food
I walked up to her and I said \"Hey!\"
\"When's the baby due?\"

She said \"Baby?\"
\"I'm not having a baby,\"
\"what you talkin' about?\"
I said \"Sorry... Mrs. Parker\"
I put my foot in my mouth

(chorus)
I got my foot in my mouth,
guess I should watch what I say,
I got my foot in my mouth,
it's prob'ly better that way

I took my brother to the mall last Christmas,
to see Santa and his sleigh,
I said \"Aren't you glad that you're old enough,\"
\"to know that Santa is fake?\"

He said \"Fake? Santa's not fake!\"
\"What you talkin about?\"
I said \"No, I didn't tell ya Santa was fake!\"
\"I said...Santa's great...\"
I put my foot in my mouth

(chorus)

\"here's the last verse\"

I was braggin' to a friend of mine
how I ran over this cat,
I said \"His name was fluffy, cause I read the tag...\"
\"right after I squashed him flat\"

She said \"Fluffy? My cat's name is Fluffy! He was my best friend.\"
I said \"No, I didn't say his name was Fluffy!\"
\"I said his name was... Twinkles\"
here I go again...

(chorus x2)"
