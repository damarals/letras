"1" "It's Time (Feat. Tasha Page-Lockhart & Zacardi Cortez)									
Kirk Franklin

We've been waiting for Your presence to arrive all day
We kneel up at your feet
and we refuse to leave the same
Yokes don't break on their own
our hands are not that strong
And giving up feels wrong
when you've been waiting for so long

For destiny and victory to finally collide
There's no sound more sweeter than when God says
\"It's time. \"

Every time I step out independent, God I fail
So weary, all broken, so glad that You destroyed the veil
Condemnation is all gone, come boldly for Your throne
You say this is where I belong
that I've been patient for so long

For destiny and victory to finally collide
There's no sound more sweeter than when God says
\"It's time. \"
So tell all the voices I'm doing just fine
For this day is the day when God says, \"It's time. \"

Time for power and not just things
Time for healing the enemy
Time to be truly free
To walk in faith, not in what I see
No more time for childish things
To walk in love and feel complete
What shall we say about these things
Soon in time the world will see

For destiny and victory to finally collide
There's no sound more sweeter than when God says
\"It's time. \"
So tell all the voices I'm doing just fine
For this day is the day when God says, \"It's time. \"

For this day is the day when God says, \"It's time. \"
Lift your voices, God says, \"It's Time\""
