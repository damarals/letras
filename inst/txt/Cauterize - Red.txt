Red

Leave it all behind you
That's fine
But sometimes
The buried comes crawling back to you

You were gone, I paid your price
You left your mark, my sacrifice
This open wound where you can hide
To look away and bite the knife

Cauterize
When it bleeds
Burn away the broken lies
That I still believe
Meet the flame
Let it inside
And cauterize
I'll cauterize you

The innocence you pretend
That's mine
The proof of you
Is written on my skin

Cauterize
When it bleeds
Burn away the broken lies
That I still believe
Meet the flame
Let it inside
And cauterize
I'll cauterize you

When the dead won't stay buried
From the war that is raging
Cauterize, cauterize, cauterize

A thousand scars betray me
Oh, what's another one
At least they make me feel
Like I'm not the only one
Oh, am I the only one
Oh, are we the only ones

Cauterize
When it bleeds
Wash away the broken lies
That I still believe
Meet the flame
Let it inside
And cauterize
I'll cauterize you

You, you, you, you"
