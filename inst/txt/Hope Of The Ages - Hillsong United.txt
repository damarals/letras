"1" "Hope Of The Ages
Hillsong United

The gospel of Jesus
It's the hope of the ages
Burning brighter and brighter
And standing forever
The church He is building
Nothing can stop it
It's a city that's shining
A light in the darkness
Nothing can stop it

Though Christ was dead
Now surely He's risen
Yeah, He's coming back again
And Chris will reign
In triumph forever
Yeah, all praise belongs to Him
Yeah, all praise belongs to Jesus

His Word is the answer
For all generations
It will never be tainted
It will never be brokеn
This is our confession
This is our conviction
We beliеve what is written
We believe what You've spoken

Though Christ was dead
Now surely He's risen
Yeah, He's coming back again
And Chris will reign
In triumph forever
Yeah, all praise belongs to Him
Yeah, all praise belongs to Jesus

Sing hallelujah
Chris is our redeemer
Shout hallelujah
Jesus holds our future
Oh, we sing hallelujah (We've got a reason to sing)
Chris is our redeemer (He's redeemed, [?] )
Shout hallelujah
Jesus holds our future (He holds it all)

Though Christ was dead
Now surely He's risen
Yeah, He's coming back again (He's coming back, hallelujah)
And Chris will reign
In triumph forever
Yeah, (All praise) all praise belongs to Him (Yes, it does)
Yeah, all praise belongs to Jesus

Oh, we sing hallelujah
Chris is our redeemer
Shout hallelujah
Jesus holds our future"
