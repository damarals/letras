"1" "As A Blind
Ricardo Sá

Sometimes I donÂ’t see
Your hands guiding me
Sometimes I donÂ’t feel
Your love in my life
Sometimes my desire
is to stop and come back
Is to take in my hands my freedom

Today my world is broken
And I feel that you are not here
But I ask you, to gimme more faith
So I find myself walking in your path, again

Oh Father, Your love surrounds me
Oh Father, Your love is my history
Abba, your love makes me free
And I cannot be
I canÂ’t be far from You

Sometimes I donÂ’t see anything
Sometimes I feel myself as a blind"
