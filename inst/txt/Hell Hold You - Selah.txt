"1" "He'll Hold You
Selah

Storms may come,
Storms may go
The pain may linger
Like melting snow
The wind may toss you
To and fro but he'll hold you
Through it all

He'll hold you
When the tempest rages all around
He'll hold you
Plant your feet on solid ground
He'll hold you
When the waves come crashing down
He'll hold you through it all

Hard time will come
Rain will pour
You can't see the road anymore
You hears been washed up
Upon life's shore
But He'll hold you through it all

He'll hold you
When the tempest rages all around
He'll hold you
Plant your feet on solid ground
He'll hold you
When the waves come crashing down
He'll hold you through it all
Oh...

When you're fallin'
Hear Him callin'
He will come
In the midst of your storm

Just hold on tight
With all your might
He will hold you through it all

He'll hold you
When the tempest rages all around
He'll hold you
Plant your feet on solid ground
He'll hold you
When the waves come crashing down
He'll hold you through...
He'll hold you
When the tempest rages all around
He'll hold you
Plant your feet on solid ground
He'll hold you
When the waves come crashing down
He'll hold you through it all
He'll hold you through
He'll hold you through it all..."
