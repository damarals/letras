"1" "She Sings In Riddles
Third Day

From the recording: Southern Tracks, Track #3.

The voice of an angel, I cannot tell
Light or darkness, heaven or hell
The smile of a believer, wedged and bound
Friend or deceiver, the truth or a lie

Chorus:
She sings in riddles, she sings in rhymes
Say everything and nothing at the same time
Still there's something to loose my mind
She sings in riddles, she sings in rhymes

Words of a poet, in perfect time
With Christians and answeres,
Every verse, every line

But I smile and I wonder, is there a song
I'm not always silent.
Is it right, is it wrong?
