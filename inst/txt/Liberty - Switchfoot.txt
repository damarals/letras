Switchfoot

The feeling comes to me in waves
The darkest seas I've ever known
Mine is an odyssey of grace
Mine is a story headed home

I tie myself up to the mast
Give up the semblence of control
The sirens sing but I let them pass
Cause only you could free my soul

Only you could free my soul yeah
Only you could free my soul

Set these broken bones to cast
Stitch my wounds with holy sutures
Every saint has got a past yeah
But every sinners got a future

And only you could free my soul yeah
Only you could free my soul yeah

Show me the freedom from these chains
Show me a battlefield that's saved
Cos our world has still rolled away?
But you are my liberty

Free my soul
Free my soul
And let liberty flow
Like a flood let it go
And I'll let the past go

I'll come on
Back home
And I'll make it all known?

Oh my Lord
Oh my hope
Only you could free my soul

Free my soul
Come on and free my soul
(Only you could free my soul)
Come on and free my soul
(Only you could free my soul)

I tie myself up to the mast
I tie myself up to the mast and let it go
(Only you could free my soul)
Yeah
Yeah
Only you could free my soul"
