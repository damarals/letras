"1" "Can't Stop Praising
Hillsong United

Try to find the words to express the way You are
But the beauty of the Lord cannot be described
In just one lifetime
Look at the sun over the seas
Look at Your grace that covers me

Now I know
Yes I know
Now I know
I know Your love has saved me

In the morning, I can't stop praising Your name
In the evening, I can't stop praising Your name
In the morning, I can't stop praising Your name
In the evening, I can't stop

And I want you to know
Yes I want you to know
Oh yes I

Lord You're so amazing, every word You say is true
Better than the finest treasure,
so glad that I found You
You held me close
when I was down
Your world has turned my life around

Now I know
Yes I know
Now I know
I know how much I love You

Hallelujah, we praise Your name
We praise Your name
Hallelujah, we praise Your name
We praise Your name"
