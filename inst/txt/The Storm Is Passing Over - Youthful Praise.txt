"1" "The Storm Is Passing Over
Youthful Praise

Chorus:
The storm is passing over
Though clouds may rise
gonna win this fight
Gotta keep the faith
and patiently wait
yes the storm is passing over
Verse 1:
Sometimes my trials get so hard
seems it just wont pass
But God has promised to be right there
I know he'll take the task
My weeping may endure for a night
But joy's gonna come in the morning light
I know..
(Yes the storm is passing over)
Verse 2:
Now I don't have to worry about God's master plan
If He said He would deliver,
then leave it in His hands
So I'll walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know I'll stand the test, yea..
(Yes the storm is passing over)
Get ready, it's passing over
Get ready, it's passing over
Get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready
(Repeat)
Yes, the storm (Repeat)
Is passing over"
