Vineyard

Where I belong is at Your feet praising You
Where I belong is at Your feet touching
You Lord I need only You Pour out Your life on me again

Bring me back to the place Where I love the cross Bring me back to the place Where

I'm on my knees Bring me back to an undivided heart Jesus bring me back to You

Bring me back
Bring me back
Bring me back to You"
