"1" "I Believe
Third Day

Give me something that i can belive and then i'll
Share it with the world for everyone to see
Take away the darkness, all the pain and sadness
I know it's you that put this light inside of me

I believe in a faith that's strong
I believe in a hope that carries on
I believe in this things and more
Most of all, most of all
I believe in love

If i had the strength to move a mountain
Would you be amazed by all of my abilities
I guess it would not mean much if i didn't have love
And this is what i really want you all to see"
