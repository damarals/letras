"1" "King Of All Days
Hillsong United

VERSE 1:
In Your surrender
As You laid down Your life
You took up a sinner's cross
And Your life rescued mine

VERSE 2:
In this redemption
Love and mercy displayed
You lifted my eyes to see
That Your truth never fails

PRE CHORUS:
Lord of the heavens
King of all days
Without You my world slips away Redeemed by Your mercy
Consumed by Your grace
Now I live for You

CHORUS:
I'm found in the arms of love
For Your love
It has saved my soul
I'll run to Your arms of love
Your light's gonna lead me home

VERSE 3:
Glorious Saviour
In Your light I am free
The things of this world will fade
Still You are all that I need

BRIDGE:
At Your cross I lay my burdens
At Your feet, where Your love covers
All I've done
Now I walk with You Lord"
