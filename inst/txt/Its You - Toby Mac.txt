"x"
"1" "It's You
Toby Mac

Looking for a way out, for a way out
I was so caught up
That I couldn't find a way out, find a way out
Playing to my weakness
Can I beat this
Can I crack this surface
Into the deepness, the deepness
When I've exhausted all my ways, all my ways
And all the noise begins to fade

It's You
And everything else just falls in line
You
You will always hold this heart of mine
It's You
It's You
Lord, It's You
And everything else just falls in line

I'm into the newness, the new bliss
Me and You together
Tell me how to loop this
To loop this, to go on forever
Roll the crescendo
No more limbo
Like a new day dawning
Show me the window, the window
Where I can see it's You

Don't make no sense without You
Don't make no sense at all
It don't make no sense without You
It don't make no sense at all
I can't do this life without You
I can't do this life at all
Don't make no sense without You
It don't make no sense at all"
