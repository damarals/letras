"1" "Rhythm Of Heaven
Vineyard

Can you feel the rhythm of heaven
Bringing freedom as we sing
Can you feel the passion growing
It is beating deep within

We lay our pride on the floor
We come to surrender our all

You are the centre of it all
And that is why we fall
Down on our knees
We're here 'cause we heard your Spirit's call
Now the curtain has been torn
As we worship we are freed

Can we feel the power of heaven
Bringing healing as we pray
Can you feel compassion flowing
Taking all our fears away"
