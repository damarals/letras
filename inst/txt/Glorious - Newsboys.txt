Newsboys

And if I sing out in the dark of night
Or praise you in the light of dawn
Hear my song
And lift me on your wings
And if I worship you in solitude
Or join a choir ten thousand strong
Hear my song
'ËœTil all creation sings

Glorious
Shining so glorious
Though I stumble, though I fall
You remain glorious
Towards Your light
I come running, I come running
Into Your arms
I come running, I come running

You have searched me
You have known my heart
You've heard my every anxious thought
Hear my song
It's all I have to bring
Though the battles come, this much is known:
The victory's won by You alone
Hear my song
My Savior and My King

Every faithless mission
Every false ambition
Here, I lay them at your feet
As in heaven, as on earth
I will ever sing your worth
You alone make me complete"
