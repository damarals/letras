"1" "Tell The World
Hillsong United

Don't wanna stand here and shout Your praise
And walk away and forget Your name
I stand for You if it's all I do
Cause there is none that compare to You

And all I want in this lifetime is You
And all I want in this whole world is You

Tell the world that Jesus lives
Tell the world that, tell the world that
Tell the world that He died for them
Tell the world that He lives again

No longer I, but Christ in me
Cause it's the truth that set me free
How could this world be a better place?
By Thy mercy, by Thy grace

Tell the world that Jesus lives
Tell the world that, tell the world that
Tell the world that He died for them
Tell the world that He lives again

C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You"
