"1" "At The Cross
Vineyard

I know a place, a wonderful place
Where accused and condemned
Find mercy and grace
Where the wrongs we have done
And the wrongs done to us
Were nailed there with him
There on the cross

At the cross, (at the cross)
He died for our sin
At the cross, (at the cross)
He gave us life again

At the cross, (at the cross)
You died for our sin
At the cross, (at the cross)
You gave us life again"
