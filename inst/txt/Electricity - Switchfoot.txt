Switchfoot

(Yeah, one, two)

I was just thinkin' 'bout lightning storms
Like the one that knocked the power out until dawn
The phone died and your eyes lit up, laughin'
Darlin', it's been too long

So let's shut up the phone for the rest of the afternoon
I don't need nobody right here right now but you
Come on, hang up and hang out
Come on, hang up and hang out

It's funny how we're both sittin' here alone
Watchin' strangers livin' Tv lives instead of livin' our own
Been a minute since your eyes lit up, laughin' (haha) , yeah
Maybe we could right that wrong

So let's shut up the phone for the rest of the afternoon
Yeah, I don't need nobody right here in my arms but you
Come on, hang up and hang out
Come on, hang up and hang out

Maybe we could just power down, just you and me
Maybe we could make our own
Maybe we could make our own electricity, yeah
Electricity, yeah

So let's shut up the phone for the rest of the afternoon
I don't need nobody right here in my arms but you
Come on, hang up and hang out
Come on, hang up and hang out with me
