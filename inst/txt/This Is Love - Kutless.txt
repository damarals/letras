"1" "This Is Love
Kutless

Alone in a garden weeping
Begging his father pleading
Take this cup from me
But if it's your will father let it be

All of the others sleeping
Sweat on his brow was bleeding
He could have run away but he chose to stay

This is love this is real
This is more than a hope or a feeling
It's enough to cover us
This is love

After a kiss abandoned
Beaten and cursed for passion
They lifted him up to die but he laid down his life

Death only wished it was stronger
The grave couldn't hold him longer
He rose in victory to rescue his enemies

It seems like this mercy is following me
It seems like this love has come to rescue me"
