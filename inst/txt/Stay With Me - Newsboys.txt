"1" "Stay With Me
Newsboys

When I think of love
I think of You
When I think of You
I think of forever
I'm like a child in Your arms
I feel so loved by You
Chorus
Stay with me a while
Stay with me a while
Oh, stay with me
Stay with me a while
Stay with me a while
Oh, stay with me
You are my heart's desire

We walked the desert night
I felt Your fire strong
Your glory comes to me
Living water will set me free
Pour out Your Spirit now
Eternal spring, heal me

Chorus

Stay with me
We can walk the furthest mile
Water me
For You are my heart's desire

Chorus"
