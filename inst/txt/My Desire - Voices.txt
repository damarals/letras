Voices

My desire is my God
I wanna give him all my love
With my brothers and my friends
Dwelling in is holy land
The angels will praise you
Your children adore you
YouÂ´re worthy
You' re mighty
You' re holly
Halleluyah
All the boys and girls will say
Holly, holly, hallelujah
All the children now will praise
Holly, holly, hallelujah
All the ancient man will sing
Holly, holly, hallelujah
All the church will praise like this
Holly, holly, hallelujah"
