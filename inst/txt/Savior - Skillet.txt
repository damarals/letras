I'm everything you've wanted
I am the one who's haunting you
I am the eyes inside of you, stare back at you

There's nothing left to lose
There's nothing left to prove
Surrender your love, it's all you can do

What you got, what you want, what you need
Gonna be your savior
Everything's gonna crash and break
But I know, yeah I know
What you got what you want, what you need
Gonna be your savior
Everything's gonna crash and break
Your savior

It's time to redefine your deophobic mind
Don't hesitate, no escape
The secrets on the inside

There's nothing left to lose
There's nothing left to prove
Surrender your love, it's all you can do

What you got, what you want, what you need
Gonna be your savior
Everything's gonna crash and break
But I know, yeah I know
What you got what you want, what you need
Gonna be your savior
Everything's gonna crash and break
Your savior

I am the eyes inside staring back at you (2x)
You need
You need me

What got, what you need
Everything's gonna crash and break
What got, what you need
Everything's gonna crash and break

What you got, what you want, what you need
Gonna be your savior
Everything's gonna crash and break
But I know, yeah I know
What you got what you want, what you need
Gonna be your savior
Everything's gonna crash and break
Your savior"
