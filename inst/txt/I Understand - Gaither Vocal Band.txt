"1" "I Understand
Gaither Vocal Band

Sometimes I feel like giving up
It seems like my best
Just ain’t good enough
Lord if You hear me I’m calling You
Do You see Do You care
All about what I’m going thru

And then He said:
One more day, one more step
See, I’m preparing you for Myself
And when You can’t hear My voice,
Please trust My Plan
I’m the Lord,
I see & Yes I understand

But sometimes I feel like I’m all alone
I’m just like a stranger so far from home
I feel like I’ve done all I can do
Please Lord, give me strength
I’m just tryin’ to make it thru

That’s when He told me

Chorus

One more day, one more step
See, I’m preparing you for Myself
And when You can’t hear My voice,
Please trust My Plan
I’m the Lord,
I see & Yes I understand

Oh, He knows how much that we can bear
Oh, & in the time of trouble
He promised He would always be there
Oh, I understand the Lord is telling You yes,
I understand
I am the Lord,
I see & yes I understand

I am the Lord, I changeth not
I won’t forget nor have I forgot
You see everything works
According to my plan
I am God, Trust Me
I got the whole world in My hand

Chorus
One more day, one more step
See, I’m preparing you for Myself
And when You can’t hear My voice,
Please trust My Plan
I’m the Lord,
I see & Yes I understand

I am the Lord,
I see you & yes I understand"
