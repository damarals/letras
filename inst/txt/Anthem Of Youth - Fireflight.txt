I will stand my ground,
wont be pushed around,
I'll never give it up to you!
I will stake my claim,
Won't burn in the flames,
I'll never give it up to you!
Chorus: Say it loud now,
want no part of you!
And these foolish games,
that you play!
Now I won't fall down,
toe to toe, and pound for pound,
I'll never give it up to you!
God has planted a seed,
and I have made my creed,
I'll never give it up to you!
I will fight to the end,
you'll never hurt me again,
Cause I'll never give it up to you!
my Savior died for me,
that's when He set me free,
now I'll never give that up to you!"
