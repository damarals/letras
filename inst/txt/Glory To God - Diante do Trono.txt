"1" "Glory To God
Diante do Trono

Where the lost can be found
Where the sick can be healed
Where joy is restored
Where your glory's revealed

Where the weak are made strong
Where the past is erased
Where the saints are revived
And we stand face to face

In your presence is where i find mercy
Your presence is where i find peace
In your presence is where i find healing and strength

Glory to god, glory to your name
Glory to god, glory to your name

Where the old is made new
Where the bound are set free
Where the mourning can dance
Where there's victory"
