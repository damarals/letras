"1" "O Come, o Come Emmanuel
For Today

I hear the cry of a dying world
So let your light bring the life we've been fighting for
These are the eyes of a broken man
I see the fire that inspires us to hope again

O come emmanuel and ransom your captive sons
There is one who can fight through the fog in the holy sea
And let the light leads us right to our destiny
O come emmanuel with power and righteousness
'Cause we were lost, dead in our selfish ways
But now the time is come so tonight we sing

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel!
Shall come to thee so we will
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel!
Shall come to thee, o israel

So come to us, o key of david
Come to us, o lord of mine
Come to us, desire of a nation
Come to us, wisdom from on high

See us through the darkness
The shadow of the king
I hear the cry of a dying world
So let your light bring the life we've been fighting for
These are the eyes of a broken man
I see the fire that inspires us to hope again

O come emmanuel deliver us from the grave
Come and save us the ones who believed in our ignorance
And from the blood come restore us to innocence
O come emmanuel I can hear creation cry
And every eye will see
Every mind believe
There was a mighty king
Ascend to the throne tonight

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel!
Shall come to thee so we will
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel!
Shall come to thee, o israel

The time is now!
Take your victory!
Bring redemption!
Take your victory!
Tonight we sing!
Rejoice! (rejoice!)
Rejoice! (rejoice!)"
