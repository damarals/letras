"x"
"1" "Rebirthing
Skillet

I lie here paralytic
Inside this soul
Screaming for You till
My throat is numb
I wanna break out
I need a way out
I don't believe that its gonna be this way
The worst is
The waiting
In this world I'm suffocating

Feel Your presence
Filling up my lungs with oxygen
I take You in
I've died

*Chorus*
Rebirthing now
I wanna live for love
Wanna live for You and me
(Breathe for the first time now
I came alive somehow)

Rebirthing now
I wanna live my life
Wanna give You everything
(Breathe for the first time now
I came alive somehow)

Right now
Right now

I lie here lifeless
In this cocoon
Shedding the skin cause
I'm ready to
I wanna break out
I found a way out
I don't believe that its gonna be this way
The worst is
the waiting
In this world I'm suffocating

Feel Your presence
Filling up my lungs with oxygen
I take You in
I've died

(Chorus)

Tell me when I'm gonna live again
Tell me when I'm gonna breathe you in
Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside
Tell me when I'm gonna feel alive

Tell me when I'm gonna live again
Tell me when this fear will end
Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside
Tell me when I'll feel alive

(Chorus)"
