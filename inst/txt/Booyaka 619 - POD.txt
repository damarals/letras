P.O.D.

Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
Booyaka Booyaka That's my pueblo
Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
Booyaka Booyaka Rey Mysterio

Ya llego el Rey Mysterio
Bato cabron de San Diego
Flash up on the scene like a brown crusader
Blowing up screens like space invaders

Too much damage for one to manage
Going 51 50 'speaky Spanglish
Aste a un lado estoy pesado
Vivo la vida peleando pecados
Alto porque me duele la alma
Y deje mi cartera en Tijuana
El soldado enmascarado ten cuidado
paisa paisa estas pasado

Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
Booyaka Booyaka That's my pueblo
Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
Booyaka Booyaka Rey Mysterio

Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
Booyaka Booyaka That's my pueblo
Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
What you gonna do when we come for you?

And we the Southtown generals, Diego born
Originals here, men for hire...
Untouchable, automatic, runnin the streets and the canvas
We live and direct, no breather, that's what's happenin'
Blow up the mat again, better go ask your friends again
Terror in their eyes when they tell you, here comes the mask again
No time for talkin, pick the hole for the coffin
It's no mystery Rey, that he's a dead man walkin.
Say a prayer for the living, ask God to take my soul
Incase I go unforgiven (one shot)
Two kids, you don't believe me now you will
And that's the realist deal homie since Jesus' last meal.

Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
Booyaka Booyaka That's my pueblo
Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
Booyaka Booyaka Rey Mysterio

Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
Booyaka Booyaka That's my pueblo
Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
What you gonna do when we come for you?

Mira, mira. Watcha, Watcha
Cuidado con los celos porque matan
Booyaka Booyaka el reggaeton
Mad One and Rey Mysterio esta cabron
One, two, three. 619 down with P.O.D.
Como la ves
Facil como uno, dos, tres
Mr. DJ, play that rola otra vez
And watch how many people go off
Under the wooden cross, who's the boss
Nadie brinca
De el cielo Con mi voz brillo el cielo
La voz inocente en mi gente
Truena fuerte como cuente
That's just life in the 619
So hey, DJ, hit me one more time

Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
Booyaka Booyaka That's my pueblo
Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
Booyaka Booyaka Rey Mysterio

Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
Booyaka Booyaka That's my pueblo
Booyaka Booyaka 619 (Hey)
What you gonna do when we come for you?
