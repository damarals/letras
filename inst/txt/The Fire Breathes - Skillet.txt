"1" "The Fire Breathes
Skillet

The fire breathes
The fire breathes
It grows and grows and seems to have no end
The fire breathes
The fire feeds
Search and search, consuming everything it sees

It lives inside of me
Burning, burning, burning (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It lives inside of me
The fire breathes

The fire breathes
The fire breathes
The beauty in its violence brings me peace
The fire breathes
The fire breeds
It lives in hearts, causing strength to believe

It lives inside of me
Burning, burning, burning (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It lives inside of me
The fire breathes

The fire breathes
And I need
Life in this dead man to make me free

It lives inside of me
Burning, burning, burning (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It lives inside of me
The fire breathes
