Walk amongst us, taste the sweetness of our life,
turn from the grey, turn on the color.
Walk amongst us, taste the sweetness of our life,
come towards the light you'll see much clearer.
Chorus: Cause when we're here before His throne,
there's nothing left for us to do.
There's no more trying no more failure,
There's only You Lord only You.
Tell me have you wondered, could you always have someone,
is there someway you could move forward?
Tell me have you wondered, could you always have someone,
could life be something you look toward?"
