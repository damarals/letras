"1" "Find My Way
PG

Where am I going?
I can't see my road
I ran away from you
And now I'm lost

I need to come back to you
And today is the day, today is the day
I'm waiting for your voice to say
I'm gonna show my way

I'm gonna find my way in you, Jesus
I'm gonna find my way in you, Lord

Now I know
You are the only way
Forever I want to follow
And obey
I'm waiting for your voice to say
I'm gonna show my way

I'm gonna find my way in you
I believe in you
I'm gonna find my way in you
I trust in you

Now I know you are
Now I know you are

I'm gonna find my way in you

I know
I'm gonna find my way

I found my way"
