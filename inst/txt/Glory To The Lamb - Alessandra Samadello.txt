"1" "Glory To The Lamb
Alessandra Samadello

I praise Your name, I praise Your name
I praise Your name, I praise Your name
Let us raise our voices to the One who sits on the throne
Everybody here can sing this joyful song
With a melody of glory waiting there to be sung
Let us praise our Godâ€™s own son

Glory! Glory to the lamb!
Glory to the One the great I am!
Glory! Glory unto him
Glory to the Lord our King!

You are holy! You are holy! All the angels will sing
And the universe will bow before the King
Even when the night surrounds us he will give us his light
I will praise his name on high
Glory! Glory to the Lord of Lords!
Glory to the King of Kings!
Glory to my God above!

Glory! Glory to the lamb!
Glory to the One the great I am!
Glory! Glory unto him
Glory to the Lord our King!

Glory! Glory to the lamb!
Glory to the One the great I am!
Glory! Glory unto him
Glory to the Lord our King!"
