Jesus Culture

Like a mighty fortress, He is our God
Like a mighty fortress, He is our God
When enemies surround us, rising like a flood
They break into pieces, swallowed in dust

He rejoices
He rejoices over us

Like a mighty warrior, He is our God
Like a mighty warrior, He is our God
His voice is like a thunder rolling through the land
He's Lion of Judah us, breaking off the fear of man

He rejoices
He rejoices over us

Upon the Rock of revelation
We're dancing now, we're dancing now
No enemy could ever shake us
We're dancing now, we're dancing now
(We dance cause)"
