For Today

Lord of glory
Make us worthy to possess your name.
I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you
I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws
You will live in the land I gave to your forefathers
You will be my people, and I will be your God.

Lord of glory
Make us worthy to possess your name.

And through all of this, there is nothing, absolutely nothing
No fear, no insecurity, no doubt, no hesitation
That will ever, ever stop us.
Because we are the sons of the living God.
Because we are the children of the almighty.
Because we are the residence of the kingdom of heaven,
And we are soldiers in an army of the immortal.
And when we speak life, life happens.
And when we speak healing, healing happens.
And when we speak truth, truth happens.
And when we go

Take what we founde to a dead world, we will see it come to life again.
When we take what we found to a hopeless world,we will see hope come back,
We will see the hearts of our world start beating again,
And we will see the color come back in peoples faces.
And absolutely nothing will ever stop that.
Mountains will move before us and oceans will part before us.
And the dead will raise before us.
And the world will know that our God is a God that heals!
That our God is God that lives!
That our God is a God that loves unlike anything anyone has ever felt before!
Because we are fearless!
Because we are his hands!
Because we are his feet!
Forever and ever!"
