"1" "In Your Freedom
Hillsong United

I search for You God of strength
I bow to You in my brokenness
And no other King could have so humbly come
To save my soul and heal my heart

I have nothing more than all You offer me
There is nothing else that’s of worth to me

And I love You Lord
You rescued me
You are all that I want
You’re all that I need

I pray to You God of peace
I rest in You my cares released

In Your freedom I will live
In Your freedom I will live
I offer devotion, I offer devotion"
