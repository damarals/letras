"1" "What You Already Own
Youthful Praise

I give you my heart broken and bruised
It's still beating strong and wanting to trust you
I know I'm unfaithful
I know I do wrong
Do you protect what you already own?
I give you my body
Naked and meek
Burning with passion
Human and weak
What you already own
...as sung by amy grant
I try to be faithful
Then I go wrong
Can you protect what you already own?
Can you protect what you already own?
I know I'm unfaithful
I know I do wrong
Do you protect what you already own?
I give you my life
Precious and rare
Knowing wherever I've been, you were there
Sometimes I'm faithful
Sometimes I'm strong
Will you protect what you already own?
I will be faithful
Help me be strong
'cause you will protect what you already own
You still protect what you already own"
