"1" "My Friend
Take 6

It doesn't matter where you say ya been
It doesn't matter whatcha done
But the same color blood that's runnin' through my veins
Is the color that sustains another one

I know that you might-a had a hard time
And maybe you thought of givin' in
'Cause no matter where you stand it's not too much to lend my hand
You're my neighbor, you're my brother and you're my friend
My friend (you're my friend) my friend
(You're my friend) my friend - yes you are

Well I know that you might get a little lonely sometimes
You know I been down that road before
And when my so-called friens were takin' each othere in
I couldn't even make it through the door

So why don't you come on in (sit on down) take a load off your mind
And I dare to choose to wear the shoes that you're in
No matter where you stand it's not too much to lend my hand
Cause You're my neighbor, you're my brother and you're my friend
My friend (my friend) my friend
(You're my friend) my friend - yes you are

I'm throwin' out that lifeline
Just tryin' to spread some sunshine
'Cause I got a lotta love for mankind
So why don't you call me sometime and I'll be by your side

Now hold on a minute, make sure you don't forget
I'll be there when you call me - just say when
No matter where you stand it's not too much to lend my hand
You're my neighbor, you're my brother and you're my friend
Oh yes you are my friend

My friend My friend My friend
Ohh... My sister my friend
Brother! All you do is call and I will be there in a (Flash)
My friend
You'll never find a better - Oh!
My friend oh, My friend
You'll never find a better friend
My friend oh, My friend
You'll never find a better friend
You'll never find a better - Oh!
My friend oh, My friend
You'll never find a better
My friend"
