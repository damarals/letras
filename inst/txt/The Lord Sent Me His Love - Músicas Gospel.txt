"1" "The Lord Sent Me His Love
MÃºsicas Gospel

My roads all led nowhere,
I was filled with despair.
In my world I felt alone,
And my hope was all gone.

Looking back at my past,
I had a ship with no mast.
All the things that I saw,
Was no help to me at all.

Chorus:
I dropped down to my knees,
Hoping I'd get help from above.
Bowing my head I said a prayer,
And the Lord sent me his love.

I felt a warmth spread over me,
He took me back to memories.
I saw the blessing I have had,
The world stopped looking bad.

The Lord restored my faith,
His love was worth the wait.
Now I say my praise to him,
And I feel I'm whole again.

Chorus:
I dropped down to my knees,
Hoping I'd get help from above.
Bowing my head I said a prayer,
And the Lord sent me his love."
