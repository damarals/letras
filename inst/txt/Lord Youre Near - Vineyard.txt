"1" "Lord You're Near
Vineyard

Lord You're near to those who are discouraged
You save those who have lost all hope
You've taken my sorrow and surrounded me with joy
You're here with me, Your touch gives me life

To You, oh Lord,
Must the glory be given [repeat 4x]

Lord, You're near, I feel secure, nothing can take me
I know Your love will be with me for all time
Oh Lord You know what I long for
You're all I want in this life, don't leave me

Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him,
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him,
Praise Him, praise Him"
