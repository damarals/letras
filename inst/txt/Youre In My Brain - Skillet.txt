"x"
"1" "You're In My Brain
Skillet

It's so urgent; it's so desperate
I can feel it in my bones (yeah)
To find a shovel and start digging
Under the water, bury myself

Chorus:
YouÂ¹re in my brain
In my brain
The life inside is breaking out
YouÂ¹re in my brain
In my brain
The life inside is breaking out

It's getting stronger; I can't contain it
It's like a fire in my bones (yeah)
It's taking over, recreating
Transforming my mind (yeah)

CHORUS

You're in my mind, in my mind
Breaking out (repeat)

CHORUS (repeat)
