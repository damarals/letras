Switchfoot

What's your direction
Tell me what's wrong
Tell me what's right

What's your direction
Think about somebody else
For the night

Life's more than girls
God's more than words
You're more than this

So what's your direction
And where are you now

Grow, grow where you are
Anchor your roots underneath
Doubt your doubts
And believe your beliefs

What's your direction
What matters most is what
You do now

What's your direction
All that you've been
Makes who you are now

'Cause I've been ashamed
I've been a fool
You know I've backed down

When I lose direction
I pray to be found
