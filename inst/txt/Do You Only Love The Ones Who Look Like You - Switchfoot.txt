"1" "Do You Only Love The Ones Who Look Like You?
Switchfoot

Where’s your heart?
Where’s this love you talk about?
Did someone hold a gun
To your head?
Who’s that girl you laugh about?
Did a feeling do you wrong?
You’ve been gone to long

Did love her?
Did you leave her cold?
Did you see her through?
Or do you only love the ones who look like you?

Where are you now?
Are you afraid of being found?
See I’m alone when you come around
Silly girl
What can you see from way up there?
Is that the world in devil’s clothes?
Looking down your nose

Are you lonely?
Are my scars too deep?
Or do you have them too?
Or do you only love the ones who look like you?

Listen, love
To a melody for you
Would it change your point of view?
Or do you only love the ones who sing your tune?
Or do you only love the ones who look like you?"
