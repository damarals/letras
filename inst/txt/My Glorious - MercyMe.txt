MercyMe

The world shaking with the love of god
Great and glorious, let the whole earth sing

And all you ever do is change the old for new
People, we believe that...

God is bigger than the air I breathe
The world we'll leave
God will save the day, and all will say
My glorious
My glorious

Clouds are breaking, heaven's come to earth
Hearts awakening, let the church bells ring

And all you ever do is change the old for new
People, we believe that...

My glorious
My glorious
My glorious
My glorious"
