Gaither Vocal Band

See the Virgin is delivered
In a cold and crowded stall;
Mirror of the Father's glory
Lies beside her in the straw.
He is Mercy's incarnation
Marvel at this miracle!
For the Virgin gently holds the
Glorious Impossible.

Love has come to walk on water,
Turn the water into wine,
Touch the leper, bless the children
Love both human and divine.
Praise the wisdom of the Father
Who has spoken through his Son.
Speaking still, He calls us to the
Glorious Impossible.

Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Glorious Impossible

He was bruised for our transgressions
And he bears eternal scars.
He was raised for our salvation
And his righteousness is ours.
Praise, oh, praise him, praise the glory
Of this lavished grace so full.
Lift your souls now and receive the
Glorious Impossible!

Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Glorious Impossible

Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Glorious Impossible
Glorious Impossible

Praise, oh, praise him, praise the glory
Of this lavish grace so full.
Lift your souls now and receive the
Glorious Impossible

Glory Hallelujah
Glory Hallelujah
Glory Hallelujah
Glory Hallelujah
Glory Hallelujah
Glory Hallelujah
Glory Hallelujah"
