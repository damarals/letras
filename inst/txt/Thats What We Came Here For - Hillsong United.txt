"1" "That's What We Came Here For
Hillsong United

We come into Your presence with singing
Come into Your presence with praise
And enter Your gates with thankful hearts
We are going to celebrate

All of heaven’s waiting
Power is on its way
So we shout hallelujah
Lifting to You a mighty roar of praise

Chorus:
You deserve the highest praise
That we can give and more
Lord, we give You our praise
That’s what we came here for

(Verse)

Everything within me reaches out to You
Your power and majesty
Grace and mercy too
There’ll be singing and dancing
Hearts and voices raised
You have set Your people free
Now the house is filled with praise
(Chorus)"
