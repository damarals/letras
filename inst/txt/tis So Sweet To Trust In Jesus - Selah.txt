"1" "'tis So Sweet To Trust In Jesus
Selah

Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to take him as his word
Just to rest upon his promise
And to know thus saith the Lord
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him

How I?ve proved him o?er and o?er
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus,
Oh, for grace to trust him more
Yesu mo ta landa Nge
Yesu mo ta landa Nge

Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to trust his cleansing blood
And in simple faith to plunge me
?neath the healing cleansing flood
Jesus, I will trust in you
Jesus, I will trust in you
Yesu mo ta landa Nge
Yesu mo ta landa Nge

Kitoko ku tula ntima na Yesu
Eh ku ndima ndiga Yandi
Yanfi me sila ntima ya mono
Mono zaba ndiga ya Nge
Yesu mo me tula ntima
Nge kieleka konso lumbu
Yesu Yesu Mfumu Yesu
Sakumuna beto landa nzambi

Yesu, mon ta landa Nge
Yesu, mon ta landa Nge
Yesu, mon ta landa Nge
Yesu, mon ta landa Nge
Yesu, mon ta landa Nge
Yesu, mon ta landa Nge
Yesu, mon ta landa Nge

I?m so glad I learned to trust Thee
(Beto ta fukama)
Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend
And I know that Thou art with me
(Oh Alleluia)
Will be with me to the end

(Oh Alleluia)
Nge me sila ntima na mono
Nge me sila ntima na mono
Yesu, Yesu
Mo ta zinga ti Nge na lola
Yesu, Yesu"
