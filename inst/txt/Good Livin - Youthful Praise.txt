"1" "Good Livin'
Youthful Praise

Come on y'all and gather around
That is why we've come to this town
There is nothing better to do
So we're gonna cut loose and sing for you
Chorus:
We're gonna harmonize and we're gonna shout
We're gonna tell you what good livin's about
I don't know about anyone else
But I've gotta cut loose and sing myself
Come on y'all and grab you a part
There's no better way for us to start
We'll sing 'en fast and we'll sing 'en slow
So get off your sear and just let go
Repeat Chorus
We're gonna sing We're gonna sing (repeat 4x)
We're gonna harmonize and shout
Gonna tell you what good livin's about
We're gonna sing, we're gonna shout
We're gonna sing, Let's sing
Gonna Sing Let's sing Yea!"
