Hillsong United

I'm so amazed
At how you take my life
Love me more, more than I deserve.

I'm blown away,
By your power to
Change this life once lost
And plant it in you.

And who would know
That I was once
On a road so far away from you.
All I know is that I live my life
To show the world your amazing love,
Your amazing love.

Your love is so pure,
Your love's so divine,
Your love transforms my soul, my mind.
Your love has the power to
Bring new hope
Amazing love,
Amazing love.

I'm so amazed, wonderful creation.
I will live to honor you, my lord,
You are the gold treasure of a life,
I will rest in you and praise eternally.

And who would know
That I was once
On a road so far away from you
All I know is that I live my life
To show the world your
Amazing love.

(repeat chorus)

I'm so amazed."
