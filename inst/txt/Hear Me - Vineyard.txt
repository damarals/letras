Vineyard

Hear me, oh Lord, and answer me
For I am poor, and I'm in need
Guard my life, save my soul
Rescue me, and take me home

You are gracious and You are good
You bring Your joy to those who call in truth

I will praise Your name
Forever You'll remain
The song that's on my heart
Teach me of Your ways
Be with me all my days
How wonderful You are"
