Skillet

The demons come when I'm all alone
Sometimes I can't tell Hell from home
I'm falling
Sinking deeper in misery
When you're away from me
'Cause when you're here I got all I need (All I need)
Fight off a thousand enemies (Enemies)
I'm calling (Calling)
I've been searching for something
Heaven or nothing

Fire up in the sky
I'm gonna light it up
Fire up in the sky
Beyond incredible

Take me away
Into a higher place
Where the blind men can see
I'm finally free, I need a miracle
Beyond incredible
Rising above
Where we can live for love
'Cause it's never enough
You're lifting me up to a miracle
Beyond incredible

When I forget what I'm fighting for (Fighting for)
I lose my way in the whims of war (Whims of war)
So helpless
Dare to reach for my destiny
Hands come up empty
Show me the way to the road back home (Road back home)
I follow you to the great unknown (Great unknown)
So reckless (Reckless)
If it cost me my everything
I'd give you anything

Fire up in the sky
I'm gonna light it up
Fire up in the sky
Beyond incredible

Take me away
Into a higher place
Where the blind men can see
I'm finally free, I need a miracle
Beyond incredible
Rising above
Where we can live for love
'Cause it's never enough
You're lifting me up to a miracle
Beyond incredible

I need a miracle
Incredible
I need a miracle
Fire up in, fire up
Incredible
Fire up in, fire up
I'm gonna light it up
Beyond incredible

Take me away
Into a higher place
Where the blind men can see
I'm finally free, I need a miracle
Beyond incredible
Rising above
Where we can live for love
'Cause it's never enough
You're lifting me up to a miracle
Beyond incredible

I need a miracle
Incredible
I need a miracle
Fire up in, fire up
Incredible
Fire up in, fire up
I'm gonna light it up"
