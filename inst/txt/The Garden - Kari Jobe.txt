"1" "The Garden
Kari Jobe

I had all
But given up
Desperate for a sign from love
Something good
Something kind
Bringing peace to every corner of my mind

Then I saw the garden
Hope had come to me
To sweep away the ashes
And wake me from my sleep

I realized
You never left
And for this moment
You planned ahead
That I would see
Your faithfulness in all of the green

I can see the ivy
Growing through the wall
'Cause you will stop at nothing
To heal my broken soul

I can see the ivy
Reaching through the walls
'Cause you will stop at nothing
To heal my broken soul

You're healing broken souls
You're healing broken souls

Faith is rising up like ivy
Reaching for the light

Hope is stirring deep inside me
Making all things right

Love is lifting me from sorrow
Catching every tear

Dispelling every lie and torment
Crushing all my fears

You crush all my fears
You crush all my fears
With Your perfect love
With Your perfect love

Now I see redemption
Growing in the trees
The death and resurrection
In every single seed"
