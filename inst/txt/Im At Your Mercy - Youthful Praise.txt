"1" "I'm At Your Mercy
Youthful Praise

As I stood inside the courtroom
The judge came walking in
There was One who stood beside me
A compassionate friend
As he spoke my situation
I knew that he was in control
Of the destiny of my eternal soul
With a hush the crowd awaited
To receive the words he'd say
A finality was pressing
Like no other day
To reveal my destination
That was what I soon would know
To eternity, where was I to go?
Chorus:
Yes, your honor, I'm at your mercy
You can do with me
Just as you please
Please remember
My testimony
The blood of Jesus
Covers me
When the time came for the verdict
The anticipation rose
But the people knew too well
The path in life they chose
Those who had not cared to answer
When in life he gave the call
Or had known his grace and love
Only to fall
But as he looked in my direction
I was not afraid
'Cause the nailed-scarred hands
Were there defending me
But then he rose to give the answer
As we bowed unto the Lord
He said \"Well done my child,
Great is your reward\"
Repeat Chorus (x2)
Please remember
My testimony
The blood of Jesus
Covers me"
