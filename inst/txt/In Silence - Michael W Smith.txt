"x"
"1" "In Silence
Michael W. Smith

On the stairs she sits and waits
She's crying out but nobody even cares
Holding in the hurt and pain
Looking for love to come pull her from this place

I'm not gonna sit and stay
In silence
I'm not gonna walk away
In silence

Sometimes we're loudest when
The doors are shut and no one can see our face
But it seems we're quiet when
Someone needs a touch of heaven's grace

We are all God's children
We need to tell of all we've been given"
