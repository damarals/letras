Vineyard

He has fire in his eyes
And a sword in his hand
And he's riding a white horse
Across this land
He has fire in his eyes
And a sword in his hand
And he's riding a white horse
Across this land
And he's calling out to you and me
\"Will you ride with me?\"

He has fire in his eyes
And a sword in his hand
And he's riding a white horse
Across this land
And he's calling out to you and me
\"Will you ride with me?\"
We say \" Yes, yes Lord,
We will ride with you\"

We say, \"Yes Lord, we will ride with you
We will stand up and fight
We will ride with the armies of heaven
We'll be dressed in white\",
\"We'll be dressed in white\"
We say, \"Yes, yes Lord, we will ride\"

He has a crown on his head
He carries a scepter in his hand
And he's leading the armies across this land
And he's calling out to you and me
\"Will you ride with me?\"
We say, \"Yes, yes Lord
We will ride with you\"

That fire in his eyes is his love for his bride
And he's longing that she be with him
Right by his side
That fire in his eyes is his burning desire
That his bride be with him, right by his side
And he's calling out to us now,
\"Will you ride with me?\""
