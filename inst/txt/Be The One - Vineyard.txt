"1" "Be The One
Vineyard

You are life giving
I give You this life
Amazing love shining through
(So) Be the one that I run to

(And) You are forgiveness
Your hands full of grace
In the shadow of Your cross I will stand
Be the one to light my way

This is Your life in my veins
Flowing through this heart
You lead to brighter days
Jesus be the One, be the One

You take my weakness and lift me again
In the shadow of Your cross I will stay
You're the One to light my way"
