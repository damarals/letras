I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT ME
IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S ALL RIGHT
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT ME
IT'S ALL RIGHT
THEY'LL GET IT ONE DAY

'CAUSE I LOVE YOU AND I'LL FOLLOW YOU
YOU ARE MY, MY LIFE
AND I WILL READ MY BIBLE AND PRAY
I WILL FOLLOW YOU ALL DAY

I DON'T CARE WHAT IT COSTS ANYMORE
'CAUSE YOU GAVE IT ALL AND I'M FOLLOWING YOU
I DON'T CARE WHAT IT TAKES ANYMORE
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I'M GOING YOUR WAY

I LOVE YOU, I'LL FOLLOW YOU
YOU ARE MY, MY LIFE
I WILL READ MY BIBLE AND PRAY
I WILL FOLLOW YOU ALL DAY

ALL DAY, ALL DAY NOW, ALL DAY

ANYONE AROUND CAN SEE
JUST HOW GOOD YOU'VE BEEN TO ME
FOR ALL MY FRIENDS WHO DON'T KNOW YOU
I PRAY THAT YOU WOULD SAVE THEM TOO"
