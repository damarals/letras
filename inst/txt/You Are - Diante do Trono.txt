"1" "You Are
Diante do Trono

Ten thousand times
Ten thousand angels sing
He is holy, He is, He is
The universe declares His majesty
He is holy, He is, He is

And we will see Him lifted high
The King of glory magnified
And from our hearts a song of praise will rise

You are our God and You will reign on high forever
Almighty One
You are El Elyon forever

Seated on the throne above all thrones
You are worthy, You are You are
All creation bows to You alone
You are worthy, You are, You are

And we'll sing
Our El Shaddai
Your Name will stand alone
Our Adonai
Your Name will stand alone
Our Sar Shalom
Yeshua You alone
Yeshua You alone"
