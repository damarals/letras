"1" "Beautiful Broken World
Warren Barfield

Wonderfully arrayed on a bright autumn day
The leaves set the trees ablaze
I'm sitting here beneath
This decaying canopy
Sunlight sitting through the shade
It won't be long
Until they're gone away
That's the price we pay

Chorus:
In this beautiful broken world
We laugh and then we cry
There's a wonderful pain and joy
In death and in life yeah, yeah
(yeah this is life)
Oh, we are living in this beautiful broken world
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

God bless the day
That little suzy came
Born on a morning in may
And no one knows why time hurries by
And youth makes room for age
I cherish those years
That she was here with us
We shared life and love

Bridge:
Would the day still be as sweet
If it had no end
If you never knew an enemy
Oh, could you understand
The worth of a friend
(By Mariana B. Villanova)"
