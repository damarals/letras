"1" "Steady My Heart
Kari Jobe

Wish it could be easy
Why is life so messy
Why is pain a part of us?
There are days I feel like
Nothing ever goes right
Sometimes it just hurts so much

But you're here, you're real
I know I can trust you

Even when it hurts
Even when it's hard
Even when it all just falls apart

I will run to you
'cause I know that you are
Lover of my soul
Healer of my scars

You steady my heart
You steady my heart

I'm not gonna worry
I know that you've got me
Right inside the palm
Of your hands
Each and every moment
What's good and what gets broken
Happens that the way you plan

You're here, you're real
I know I can trust you

Even when it hurts
Even when it's hard
Even when it all just falls apart

I will run to you
'cause I know that you are
Lover of my soul
Healer of my scars

You steady my heart
You steady my heart

And I will run to you
'Cause You're my refuge in Your arms
And I Will sing to you
'Cause of everything you are

You steady my heart
You steady my heart

Even when it hurts
Even when it's hard
Even when it all just falls apart

I will run to you
'cause I know that you are
Lover of my soul
Healer of my scars

You steady my heart
You steady my heart

I'm not gonna worry
I know that you've got me
Right inside the palm
Of your hands."
