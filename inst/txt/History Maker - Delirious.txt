"1" "History Maker
Delirious

Is it true today that when people pray
Cloudless skies will break; Kings and Queens will shake
Yes it's true and I believe it,
I'm living for you

Is it true today, that when people pray
We'll see dead men rise and the blind set free
Yes, it's true and I believe it
I'm living for you

I'm gonna be a History Maker in this land
I'm gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind
I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna run
Into your arms, into your arms again
Into your arms, into your arms again

Is it true today that when people stand
With the fire of God and the truth in hand
We'll see miracles, we'll see angels sing
We'll see broken hearts making history
Yes it's true and I believe it
I'm living for you
