"1" "I'm Free
Gaither Vocal Band

So long I've had searched for life's meaning
Enslaved by this world and its greed.
But then the door of my prison was opened by love
For the ransom was paid, I was freed.

I'm free from the fear of tomorrow
I'm free from the guilt of the past.
For I traded my shackles for a glorious song
I'm free, praise the Lord, free at last.

I am free from the guilt that I carried
From this dull and empty life I'm set free.
For when I met Jesus, He made me complete
He forgot the foolish man I used to be.

I'm free from the fear of tomorrow
I'm free from the guilt of the past.
Oh, I traded my shackles for a glorious song
I'm free, praise the Lord, free at last."
