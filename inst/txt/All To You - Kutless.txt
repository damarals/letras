Kutless

I lift my eyes up to you
Father, healer, friend
My one desire is to know you, God
My soul was made for you
Jesus, I live for you

I'm yours, every beat of my heart
I'm yours, here to reflect who you are
I'm desperate for you, desperate for you
Jesus, I surrender it all
All to you

I lift my life up to you
Creator, savior, friend
My one desire is to know you, god
My soul will sing for you
Jesus, I worship you

I'm yours, every beat of my heart
I'm yours, here to reflect who you are
I'm desperate for you, desperate for you
Jesus, I surrender it all

Almighty, all glorious
God upon the throne, we live to worship you alone
Almighty, all glorious
God upon the throne, we live to worship you alone, alone

I'm yours, every beat of my heart
I'm yours, here to reflect who you are
I'm desperate for you, desperate for you

I'm yours, every beat of my heart
I'm yours, here to reflect who you are
I'm desperate for you, desperate for you
Jesus, I surrender it all
Jesus, I surrender it all
All to you"
