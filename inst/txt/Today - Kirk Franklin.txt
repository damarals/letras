Hey Hey Hey Hey....

Today, I'm hungry and I'm ready for change
I run too farthest to be the same
See who I was I give him away
Today
Today, No longer bound by what people say
I know that I will make mistakes
I thought that I refuse to stay
Today

I've been waiting all my life to get to the door
And now it’s time to help someone see they’re alive for so much more

[CHORUS]
(Today we goin’)
Love somebody
Heal somebody (We goin’)
Free somebody (Yeah)
Forgive somebody (Today we goin’)
Touch somebody
Love somebody (We goin’)
Kiss somebody
Let go of somebody

Today, I see the hurt upon your face
Thinking how much more of this can I take
In a minute I’m about to break
Today
See the pain, has purpose sole of going away
There’s a harvest if you’ll only wait
Don’t walk out now I need you to stay
Today

Though you’ve never felt winds blow like this before
But if what you see is all you see you will miss this so much more

[CHORUS]
(Today we goin’)
Love somebody (We goin’)
Heal somebody
Free somebody
Forgive somebody (Today we goin’)
Touch somebody
Love somebody
Kiss somebody
Let go of somebody
Today (We goin’ live our lives)
Today
Today (We’re not looking back no more)
Today (Yeah)
(let, let, let, let’s go)

Hey Hey Hey Hey....
(Louder ya’ll)
Hey Hey Hey Hey....
(Just a little bit louder ya’ll)

Today yeah...
Hey Hey Hey Hey....
Today yeah...

Today, I think I feel the wind to change
Think I felt my last drop of rain
I believe I’m gonna be ok
Today
See today, (Today) I’m still here because of my faith (my faith)
I believe that Jesus still is the way
I said His name cauz I ’m not afraid
Today

[CHORUS]
Love somebody
Heal somebody
Free somebody
Forgive somebody (We gon’)
Touch somebody
Love somebody (We gon’)
Kiss somebody
Let go of somebody
[2x]

Hey Hey Hey Hey....
