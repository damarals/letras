Vineyard

Purify my heart
Let me be as gold and precious silver.
Purify my heart, let be as gold, pure gold.

Refiner's Fire, my heart's one desire
Is to be holy, set apart for You,
My Master, ready to do Your will.

Purify my heart, cleanse me from within
And make me holy.
Purify my heart, cleanse me from my sin, Deep within"
