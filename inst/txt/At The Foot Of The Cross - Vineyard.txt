"1" "At The Foot Of The Cross
Vineyard

Standing before You here
I hardly recognized You with tears
Is this the body of a King
Beaten and stripped of everything

Silent as men mock Your name
Crucified in weakness and shame
Spilling Your life upon the ground
You cry for mercy for all those around

Once again I humbly bow
At the foot of the cross
The feet of the greatest One of all
Torn up hands held apart
A broken man a wounded heart
This is our God and this is love

I lift my voice to thank You again
Your love for me I'll never comprehend
I'll sing it for the rest of my day
Remembering the price You had to pay"
