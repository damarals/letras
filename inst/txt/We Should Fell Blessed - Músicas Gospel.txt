"1" "We Should Fell Blessed
MÃºsicas Gospel

We'll travel all our roads,
Trying to do, as we should.
We will make many friends.
And pray our life is good.

The moments that we live,
Is something we can save.
But many take for granted,
The gift they were gave.

Chorus:
We should feel blessed,
God gave us memories.
They are movies we see,
When we play a memory.

I don't think we'd like,
Or could live with a mind.
If we had to live a life,
With no memories to find.

What would pull us though,
When the world got us down.
We'd have no where to go,
If no memories were found.

Chorus:
We should feel blessed,
God gave us memories.
They are movies we see,
When we play a memory."
