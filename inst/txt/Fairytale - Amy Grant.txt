Fairytale.
My life was just a fairytale.
I was letting an illusion
Come into this heart of mine.
Fairytale.
Searchin' for a fairytale,
Hiding in a world
Where life was simple all the time.

I was just like Peter Pan in Never Never Land,
Afraid of what the future might be.
Afraid to face the things I couldn't understand.
Afraid of things that I couldn't see.

But fantasy,
I know there's more to life than a fantasy.
There's so much more that my life was meant to be.
So much more than make-believe.

Fairytale.
It seems just like fairytale.
But there's something in my heart
That says this time the story's real.
Fairytale.
Extraordinary tale.
Of a King who offers love
So far beyond what I can feel.

There's a world out there that human eyes can never see,
But it's just within the reach of the heart.
Two princes wages the battle for eternity,
But the Victor has been known from the start.

Now I can see
The truth can seem so much like a fantasy,
But make-believe was never as real to me,
I know this time the story's true.

Just like Sleeping Beauty in a neverland,
I was dying under a spell,
But then a Prince who comes from the foreverland
Awakened me from my fairytale.
