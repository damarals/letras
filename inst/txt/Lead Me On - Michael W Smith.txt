Michael W. Smith

\"Lead Me On\"

Shoulder to the Wheel
For someone elseÂ´s selfish gain
Here there is no choosing
Working the clay
Wearing their anger
Like a ball and chain
Fire in the field
Underneath a blazing sun
But soon the sun was faded
And freedom was a song
I heard them singing
When the day was done
Singing to the holy One

Lead me on
Lead me on
To a place where the river runs
Into your keeping
Lead me on
Lead me on
The awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking
Lead On

Wainting for the train
Labelled with a golden star
Heavy hearted boarding
Whispers in the dark
Where are we going
Is it very far ?
Bitter cold terrain
Echoes of a slamming door
In chambers made for sleeping
Forever
Voices like thunder
In a mighty roar
Cry to the lord
Lead me on
Lead me on
To a place where the river runs
Into your keeping
Lead me on
Lead me on
The awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking
Lead On
Man hurts man
Time and time again
And we drown in the wake
Of our power
Somebody tell me why"
