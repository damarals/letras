"1" "I Believe
Youthful Praise

Now I know there's a better way
I love you more and more each day
I put my faith in the One I love
And I believe in God above
I believe, I believe
I believe in the Son of God
I'm alive in you Jesus
No one could ever save my soul but you
Forever
Forever
Forever I'll praise your name"
