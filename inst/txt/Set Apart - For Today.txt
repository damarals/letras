For Today

Separated from that body bound in sin... (free from bondage...)
And crucified with Christ, that man no longer lives. (revived...)
Purify me. (Purify me.)
Let my life testify that Your death was enough.
Purify me. (Purify me.)
Let Your Kingdom on earth, match Your Kingdom above.

I've been broken out of slavery.
Sin has no right to me.
I've been broken out of slavery.
And You, my King, have made me free.

We will not conform to a world that celebrates our self-destruction.
We will not conform, because we know we were born for revolution.

Separated from that body bound in sin... (free from bondage...)
And crucified with Christ, that man no longer lives. (revived...)
Purify me. (Purify me.)
Let my life testify that Your death was enough.
Purify me. (Purify me.)
Let Your Kingdom on earth, match Your Kingdom above.

Age to age, You're calling me to holiness.
And age to age, the standard is for righteousness to mark this life.
So teach me how to turn my heart away
From the worthless things that I've kept so near.
Teach me how to turn my heart away
Until Your voice is all that I hear.

We will fight to change this system.
We will not conform. We will not conform.
We will not conform. (We will not conform...)
We will not conform. (We will not conform...)"
