"1" "Without My Memories
MÃºsicas Gospel

I am chasing after dreams,
With a gift god gave to me.
He allows me to write words,
That i have in memories.

He put them in my mind,
For me to recall.
He sends the prettiest words,
That i ever saw.

Chorus:
I know it's god's gift,
And i thank him for it.
Without my memories,
There's so much i'd forget.

The words flow out to me,
And come so easily.
I don't know what i've done,
To write the words i see.

I didn't know of god's gift,
Until a girl led me there.
Now everyone finds words,
Written everywhere.

Chorus:
I know it's god's gift,
And i thank him for it.
Without my memories,
There's so much i'd forget."
