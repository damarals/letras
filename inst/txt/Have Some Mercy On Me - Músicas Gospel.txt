"1" "Have Some Mercy On Me
MÃºsicas Gospel

Everything is spinnin', I've lost all control.
The Devil's smilin', he's waitin' for my soul.
I got involved with drugs, and lost my friends.
I traded them for an addiction that never ends.

Temptation got me 'cause I wasn't strong.
Someone dared me, and then I chose wrong.
I'm always lyin', I'm ashamed of what I do.
And I pray no one has to walk in my shoes.

Started takin' drugs, and thought I was hot.
Now my brain's dead, my eyes are bloodshot.
Everything's hazy, can't believe what I see.
Lord, please help me, have some mercy on me.

The snake led Eve to an apple on the tree.
She was then tempted as drugs tempted me.
Once you get the habit, you have it for life.
All you get are heartaches by not doin' right.

Started takin' drugs, and thought I was hot.
Now my brain's dead, my eyes are bloodshot.
Everything's hazy, can't believe what I see.
Lord, please help me, have some mercy on me."
