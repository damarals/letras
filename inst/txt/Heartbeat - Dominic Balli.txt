"x"
"1" "Heartbeat
Dominic Balli

I miss you close to me
And I miss your melody
This world is loud and cold
The sound it drags me down
Just to hear you sing
I'll push through anything

I can't do this all alone
When I hear your heartbeat baby
I know my worries are gone
I know that I made it home
When I hear your heartbeat baby I've heard it all before
It's still my favorite song
Yes your heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat
Heartbeat heartbeat still my favorite song

You're all I really need
And like the air I breathe
I can't live without
Your fire your fight your light
I know I'll make it through
As long as I got you

It goes on and on and on
You're still the only one my favorite song
And if the world falls down
Around me you'll carry me on"
