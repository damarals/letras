"1" "The Hardest Art (Ft. Kaela Sinclair) Lyrics
Switchfoot

You're still there in the back of my mind
In that sunset together
Looking back I see the warning signs
Calling us now or never
Every movie makes love seem easy
They fall in love like the fire burns
And maybe I'm the only one
But it feels like love is the hardest art to learn
Stepping into the neon sky
Compass set on forever
We swim for shore in the bright red tide
With notes that time couldn't sever
Every movie makes love seem easy
They fall in love like the fire burns
And maybe I'm the only one
But it feels like love is the hardest art to learn
Love is
Surrender is
Love is
Surrender is
Love is the hardest art
The hardest art to learn"
