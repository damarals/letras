"1" "I Know How To Say Thank You
Gaither Vocal Band

I don't know about the future
I don't understand some things about the past
I don't why some things happen
I don't why some things end and others last
I don't know of the rhymes and reasons
I don't understand the words some people pray
When I see the hand of mercy Lord
protect me the dangers in my way

I know how to say to say thank you
I know a blessing when I see one
I'm a recipient of grace
through the hours and the days
I know how to say thank you

There are times today when angels
stood around me and I couldn't even see
There were times when I was hurting
and then you stepped in and took the pain from me
There were moments when you stopped me Lord
so I could I smell the roses by the road
Though I not the wisest person
there are some things that beyond a doubt I know

I know how to say to say thank you
I know a blessing when I see one
I'm a recipient of grace through the hours and the days
I know how to say thank you

I know how to say to say thank you
I know a blessing when I see one
I'm a recipient of grace through the hours and the days
I just want to say thank you
Thank you
Oh Lord, I thank you
Thank you, Lord

I know how to say thank you"
