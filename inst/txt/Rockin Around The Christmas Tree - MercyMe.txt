"1" "Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree
MercyMe

Rockin' around
The Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung
Where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around
The Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit
Ring later
We'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get
A sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing
\"Let's be jolly
Deck the halls
With boughs of holly\"

Rockin' around
The Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing
Merrily
In the new
Old-fashioned way
Hey

You will get
A sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing
\"Let's be jolly
Deck the halls
With boughs of holly\"

Rockin' around
The Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung
Where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rocking around
The Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing
Merrily
In the new
Old-fashioned way

Rocking around
The Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing
Merrily
In the new
Old-fashion way"
