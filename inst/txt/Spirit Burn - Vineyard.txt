Vineyard

Bless your church with tongues of fire
Holy spirit move
Leave no trace of man's desire
Spirit burn right through
Spirit burn, spirit burn, spirit burn, spirit burn

Glorify your name
Let your kingdom rule over our hearts
Father show your face
Let the light of heaven shine from us

Rushing wind blow through this place
Pierce this worldly veil
Fill our streets with your sweet salvation
Love that never fails
Spirit burn, spirit burn, spirit burn, spirit burn

Holy fire, fall like rain
Mark your church to bear your name
Come in power, come and reign
Sanctify and stir your saints"
