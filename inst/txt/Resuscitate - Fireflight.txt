"1" "Resuscitate
Fireflight

Find me in the shadows
Find me in the darkest night
Lost in the battle
Between wrong and right
I feel lifeless
I'm so helpless
Pull me back from the edge

Resuscitate
Bring me back to life
Resuscitate
Look into my eyes
I can see the light
I don't wanna let go
I'm fighting for my soul
Resuscitate
Bring me back to life

I feel my heart beating
Pounding inside my chest
I can hear you breathing
You're saving me from death
I feel weightless
I see heaven
Pull me back now
Pull me back from the edge"
