"1" "He Will Come
NÃ­vea Soares

He will come and everything that is will be no more
He will come and all the glory of this world be cast down
He will come and wipe away the tears from every eye
He will come and the enemy of my soul is condemned forever more

The spirit and the bride say: come
Come and rapture your bride
They say: come
Come and rapture your bride
Come

He will come and he will draw me closer to his heart
He will come and in the love of his embrace i'll have delight
He will come and the fire of his holiness burns in my heart
He will come and i want to see his glory fills the place
I long for you
I wait for you
Let your fire burn in me
Awaken my heart, oh Lord
I wanna see ready, ready for you"
