"1" "The Righteousness
Selah

Verse I
There is something that I need to share
A few of you may already be aware
Instead of complaining, saying life is so hard
Came to tell you you're the righteousness of God
The righteous man walks in integrity
There shall be blessings on his family
If he's faithful 'til the end
The righteous man shall live again
Chorus
I am the righteousness of God
I can stand in the violent storm, oh yes
I am the righteousness of God
With right posture, I've taken the form of
He that defeated the enemy
If I resist him, he has to flee
Resisting doesn't mean I have to run away
I don't have to receive what the devil says
Stronghold, you've got to come down
Verse II
David wrote, God loves the righteous
That includes each and every one of us
The Bible says that we've been justified
And the righteous can never be denied
When the righteous are in authority
People rejoice and shout unto Thee
He made you righteous so that you can stand
David wrote, He'll uphold the righteous man
Chorus
Vamp
Stronghold, come down (4x)
I mean it"
