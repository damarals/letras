"1" "Fresher Than A Night At The W
Toby Mac

Hey yo, it's me TobyMac and I don't mean to trouble you
I'm feelin' fresher than a night at the W
You're probably saying, Yo, we've heard quite enough of you
With God and your rhymes and the freaky Jesus stuff you do
Like always pushing for that racial diversity
Leave us alone, we're at home in our fantasies
I know a guy who knows a guy who has brown skin
Once in a while if it so happens I'm around him
We'll never be that shining city on a hill, ya'll
until we show a proof that people what is real ya'll
It's like we're day old dirty water in the tub of life
Give me a fire that inspires all the world tonight
Give me a fire that inspires all the world tonight"
