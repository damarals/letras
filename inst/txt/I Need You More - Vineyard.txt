"1" "I Need You More
Vineyard

I give my everything to You
You are the source of all that's pure
And from the darkness of my night
I'm calling out to You

'Coz with a word You raise the dead
(And) With Your voice You calm the storm
From the darkness of my night
I'm calling out to You

Oh, Jesus my Lord
I need You more
More than the morning needs the sun
More than a child
Needs it's mother's love [repeat]"
