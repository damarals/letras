O Come All Ye Faithful
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him,
Born the King of Angels;
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord

O come, all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him
O come, all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him

Sing, choirs of angels,
Sing in exaltation,
Sing all ye citizens of Heaven above
Glory to God, glory in the highest
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord

O come, all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him
O come, all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him

O Sing Hallelujah
Come let us adore Him
O Sing Hallelujah
Come let us adore Him

Yes, Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning
Jesus to Thee be all Glory given
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

O come, all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him
O come, all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him

O Sing Hallelujah
Come let us adore Him
O Sing Hallelujah
Come let us adore Him"
