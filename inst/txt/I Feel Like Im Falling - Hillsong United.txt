"1" "I Feel Like I'm Falling
Hillsong United

Standing tall in this wide space
Getting lost in Your embrace
I see a fire burning brighter
It’s calling me to catch the flame

I feel like I’m falling
Over and over in love with You
It’s not just a feeling
But I know that He is real

I feel like I’m falling
Into the arms of the mighty God
It’s not just a feeling
But I know that He is real

You’re drawing me closer to Your side
It’s the safest place I know where to hide
With one glance You captured my heart
You speak Your words and set me apart

I feel like I’m falling"
