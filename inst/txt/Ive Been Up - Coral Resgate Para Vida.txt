Coral Resgate Para Vida

I've been up, i've been down
But i'll never turn around
I've been glad, i've been sad
But i'll never turn around. (4x)

I remember lord, what you've done for me
I remember lord, how you set me free
I remember lord, how you brought me out
But i'll never, never, never, never, no, no, no, don't turn around.

I've been up, i've been down
But i'll never turn around
I've been glad, i've been sad
But i'll never turn around.(2x)

I remember lord,what you've done for me
I remember lord, how you set me free
I remember lord, how you brought me out
But i'll never, never, never, never, no, no, no, no don't turn around.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Never. (4x)"
