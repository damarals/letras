"1" "Christmas Like A Child
Third Day

I wanna feel Christmas
How it used to be
With all of its wonder
Falling on me
The season is felt so empty
Oh for quite awhile
I wanna feel Christmas
Like a child

I wanna see snowflakes
Fall to the ground
My brothers and sisters
All gathered around
Singing \"Away in a Manger\"
As we sit by the fire
I wanna feel Christmas
Like a child

It’s been so long now I can’t say
Just when I lost my way
But I’m going back to how it was

When this day meant everything
We spent our time remembering
the Baby Child born for all
It’s all about Jesus
Asleep in the straw
Sent from this King
The Savior for all
So why don’t be best to be ringing
Cause I’ll join with angels singing
Gloria
And I can feel Christmas like a child

I wanna feel Christmas like a child
I wanna feel Christmas like a child
I wanna feel Christmas like a child
I wanna feel Christmas like a child
I wanna feel Christmas like a child
I wanna feel Christmas like a child"
