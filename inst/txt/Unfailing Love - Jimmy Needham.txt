"1" "Unfailing Love
Jimmy Needham

You're my unfathomable precious unimaginable joy
And you're exceedingly excited and abundantly more than I could ask for
With your hand in mine we will pass through time and space
And every second, every minute, every hour of every day I'll say

My unfailing love for you will not be moved
For you will not be moved
My unfailing love for you
And though the mountains be shaken
And the hills be removed
Yet my unfailing love for you

He tells a story of a King coming in glory and He is
And that same Man who devised that plan united ours with His
And so hand in hand we will walk with Him as our two become as one
And all the promises He promises to us He promises will never be undone

My unfailing love for you will not be moved
For you will not be moved
My unfailing love for you
And though the mountains be shaken
And the hills be removed
Yet my unfailing love for you

Be my wife

My unfailing love for you will not be moved
For you will not be moved
My unfailing love for you
And though the mountains be shaken
And the hills be removed
Yet my unfailing love for you"
