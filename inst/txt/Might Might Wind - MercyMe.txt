I lift my hands to feel the breeze
A holy presence all over me
Jesus bring your mighty wind
And breathe life into us again
And set your people free

I lift my hands to feel the rain
A holy shower to wash me clean
Jesus let your sweet rain pour
And wash away our burdens Lord
And set your people free

Let Your mighty mighty wind blow over me
Let your sweet rain wash me clean
Rekindle the fire deep down in my soul Oh Lord
Mighty mighty wind blow over me

Mighty wind enter in
Mighty wind enter in
