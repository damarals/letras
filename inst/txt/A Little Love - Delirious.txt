"1" "A Little Love
Delirious

Discipline is the bullet in my gun.
Freedom is the thing that keeps it fun.
I'm trying hard to shed my other skin.
And wash away the hurt that lies within.
When sadness feels so strong,
And hope does not belong.

All you need is love,
A little love to get us through.
All you need is love,
Just a little love, to get us through.

Regulate the info in my herd.
Keep my hanging from this tiny thread.
Without a prayer, i'm going down.
Beneath the waves where men are lost and found.
When happiness is gone,
And hope does not belong.

Loving you is the only way.
Living you is my everyday.
When sadness feels so strong,
And hope does not belong.
Everything we lose and find,
is hidden in the sinking sand."
