Youthful Praise

[Verse:]
I will lift up my voice unto the Lord,
for He is good.

I will lift up my voice unto the Lord,
for He is good.

I will lift up my hands unto the Lord,
for He is good.

I will lift up my hands unto the Lord,
for He is good.

[Chorus:]
The Lord reigns on the throne in heaven,
clothed with glory and majesty.

Let all the earth and all of heaven,
give Him praise, our God reigns.

[Verse]

[Chorus]

[Vamp:]

[Altos:]
Glory, honor, wisdom, power,
to the matchless King
for He shall reign forever
and ever, and ever and ever.

I will sing...

[Sopranos:]
Hallelujah to the King
for He shall reign forever and ever
and ever and ever.

I will sing...

[Tenors:]
I will lift my hands up,
I will lift my voice up,
I will lift a praise to the King
for He shall reign forever and ever
and ever and ever.

I will sing...

[Vamp 2:]
He reigns.
[repeat as desired]

I will sing...

[Vamp 1]

[Vamp 2]

[Ending:]
He reigns, our God reigns."
