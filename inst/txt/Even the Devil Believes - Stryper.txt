Even The Devil Believes

Religion's at our door
But yet we search
For something more

We see the prophecies
But that won't bring us
To our knees

All the answers are contained
Within the golden book
Every scar and red blood stain
Ignored and overlooked

(Chorus)
Even The Devil Believes
Piety can leave you to bleed

The planets could align
And we'd say we need
To see more

We're reading every sign
Except the one
That's on The Door
(That leads us to eternity)

Instructions are laid out for us
Addressing every plea
Everything that's right and just
But we're too blind to see

(Chorus)
Even The Devil Believes
Piety can leave you to bleed
Even The Devil Believes
Piety can leave you to bleed"
