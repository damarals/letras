"1" "Love Is Not A Fight
Warren Barfield

Love is not a place
To come and go as we please
It's a house we enter in
Then commit to never leave

So lock the door behind you
Throw away the key
We'll work it out together
Let it bring us to our knees

Love is a shelter
In a raging storm
Love is peace
In the middle of a war
And if we try to leave;
May God send angels to guard the door
No, love is not a fight
But it's something worth fighting for

To some love is a word
That they can fall into.
But when they're falling out
Keeping that word is hard to do

Love is a shelter
In a raging storm
Love is peace
In the middle of a war
And if we try to leave;
May God send angels to guard the door
No, love is not a fight
But it's something worth fighting for

Love will come to save us
If we'll only call
He will ask nothing from us
But demand we give our all

Love is a shelter
In a raging storm
Love is peace
In the middle of a war
If we try to leave;
May God send angels to guard the door
No, love is not a fight
But its something worth fighting for
I will fight for you
Would you fight for me
It's worth fighting for

I will fight for you
Would you fight for me??
It's worth fighting for"
