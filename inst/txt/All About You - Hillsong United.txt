"1" "All About You
Hillsong United

hear our praises
hear your people sing
hear our hearts cry
Your love is everything

and all will hear this shout
as the nations turn to You
and this will be our anthem

'cause we're all about You
and the world You promise
and all we have we'll give You praise
'cause we're all about you
and the world can't stop us
living Your way, always

let our hearts pray
as we praise Your name
let the earth shake
this is the sound of faith

and the walls will fall down
and religion will break
and the nations will hear this shout
can you hear the sound of faith?

all the walls are falling down
as all the nations praise
and all the earth will hear this shout
can you hear this sound of faith?"
