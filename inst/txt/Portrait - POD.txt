P.O.D.

You're not who they say you are
They made you the enemy
(CHRIST-jah flesh; CHRIST-light within; CHRIST-Begining and the end)
Taken something so beutiful
Painted a new picture that makes me sick
(CHRIST-Witness; CHRIST-Living one; CHRIST-First and last)
Feed our minds confusion
Sweeten the taste of pollution
(CHRIST-Word life; CHRIST-Ressurect; CHRIST-Everlasting jah)
CHORUS:
Some people call you father
Maybe you could set me free
These people hate eachother
But you've always been there for me

I refuse to be like you
Without my life, caving in
(CHRIST-Jah flesh; CHRIST-Light Within; CHRIST-Begining and the end)
I surrender, giving up all that is me
Yeilding to you
(CHRIST-Witness; CHRIST-Living one; CHRIST-First and the last)
Shape me in my brokeness
Empower me forever
(CHRIST-Word life; CHRIST-Ressurect; CHRIST-Everlasting jah)
CHORUS
I know you will complete this work started in me
I need you more than ever now that I know who you are
I know you will complete this work started in me
I need you more than ever know that I've come so far
