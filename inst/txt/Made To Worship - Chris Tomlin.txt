"1" "Made To Worship
Chris Tomlin

Before the day
Before the light
Before the world revolved around the sun
God on high
Stepped down into time
And wrote the story of His love for everyone

He has filled our hearts with wonder
So that we always remember

Chorus:
You and I are made to worship
You and I are called to love
You and I are forgiven and free
You and I embrace surrender
You and I choose to believe
You and I will see who we were meant to be

All we are
And all we have
Is all a gift from God that we receive
Brought to life
We open up our eyes
To see the majesty and glory of the King

He has filled our hearts with wonder
So that we always remember

Chorus:

Even the rocks cry out
Even the Heavens shout
All the sound of His holy name
So let every voice sing out
Let every knee bow down
He’s worthy of all our praise

Chorus: (2x’s)"
