"1" "It's You
Fireflight

I wish that I could break all the mirrors in my mind
The ones that lie to me and steal away my pride
I wish I could be blind to everything that haunts me,

If I use my heart, I can see your face
You show me the real me

Its You that I search for
It is You I cant live without
your hope is what I long for
when nothings left in me
Its You

This world is always trying to take a piece of me
But you are always there to make me feel complete
If I can keep my eyes on what you have for me
I will face the truth, and never look away
Youll show me the real me

When I have nowhere else to go
And I cant find my way out
Your light it comes to guide me
I cant hide you show me the real me"
