"1" "The Hardest Art
Switchfoot

You're still there in the back of my mind
In that sunset together
Looking back I see the warning signscalling us now or never

Every movie makes love seem easy
They fall in love like the fire burns
And maybe I'm the only one
But it feels like love is the hardest art to learn

Stepping into the neon sky
Compass set on forever
We swim for shore in the bright red tide
With notes that time couldn't sever

Every movie makes love seem easy
They fall in love like the fire burns
And maybe I'm the only one
But it feels like love is the hardest art to learn

Love is
Surrender is
Love is
Surrender is
Love is the hardest art
The hardest art to learn

Love is
Surrender is
Love is
Surrender is
Love is the hardest art

Every movie makes love seem easy
They fall in love like the fire burns
And maybe I'm the only one
But it feels like love is the hardest art to learn

But it feels like love is the hardest art
Is the hardest art to learn
The hardest art

Love is
Surrender is
Love is
Surrender is
Love is the hardest art
The hardest art

Love is
Surrender is
Love is
Surrender is
Love is the hardest art"
