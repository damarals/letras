"x"
"1" "I Worship You
MercyMe

I've been walking with a big grin
singing with my eyes closed
liftin' up my hands
I've been lost in the moment
sendin' up praises
now I think I understand

When I open up and let it flow
I feel your touch and then I know..

CHORUS
I can never live without it
and I'm never gonna doubt it
everyday is new.. yeah
there's nothing any better
I'll be singing it forever
I worship You

I'm standing on the edge now
looking to a new place
goin' deeper still
the feeling is electric
the Power and the Glory
just move me where You will

cuz you take this song and make it fly
into my soul and that is why

CHORUS

I just wanna dive into your grace
I wanna feel your presence, seek your face
I just wanna be where you are

I can never live without it
and I'm never gonna doubt it
everyday is new yea

Chorus 2x's
