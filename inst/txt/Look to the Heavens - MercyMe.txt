MercyMe

words: Bart Millard music: Bart Millard
chorus
We look to the heavens oh God of grace
Pour down your mercy reveal Your face
Revive this land with the heartbeat of You
Jesus we need You
verse
Here in our hearts
There's a hunger
To bring glory and honor to you Lord
Jesus you are
Like no other
Without you we have nothing to live for
So fall on us
Renew our hearts
Revive us Lord, revive us Lord
