"1" "Jesus Won It All
Hillsong United

Life evermore
Peace beyond measures
Jesus won it all

Saved out of darkness
Cleansed by his blood
Into his kingdom
By the power of god

He has won it, my salvation
My forgiveness, at the cross
He is healing, he's redemption
For whoever would come
He has won, that's the cross

All can take freely
Water of life
Let all who thirst, come
Worship jesus christ

He has won it, my salvation
My forgiveness, at the cross
He is healing, he's redemption
For whoever would come
He has won, that's the cross

For in him is the life
That destroyed sin and death
And he broke every chain
For the bound and oppressed

He's alive, he's alive"
