"1" "Arms Of My Father
Vineyard

There is a place that I know
Where I need more often to go
A place of amazing comfort and rest
Where a smile is never rare
And Your love is as free as the air
And I lack for nothing
When I can see the love in Your eyes
And know that it's all for me

Chorus:
I fear nothing at all
When I'm safe in the arms of my Father
And if ever I fall
I take comfort in knowing
That You are there"
