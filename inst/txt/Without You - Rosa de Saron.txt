"x"
"1" "Without You
Rosa de Saron

All my life, all my history
Just made sense when I met you
Your eyes, your face
Just take me beyond what I thought

If I sometimes hide on you I find myself
I can't even pretend
I need to say: I miss you, you
There's no way to explain

It was without you that I understood
That is not easy to live without you
My broken heart says that I can not
I can not live never more without you
Without you

All my life, all my history
Just made some sense when I met you
Your eyes, oh, your holy face
Just take me beyond what I thought

If I sometimes hide on you I find myself
I can't even pretend
I need to say: I miss you, you
There's no way to explain

It was without you that I understood
That is not easy to live without you
My broken heart says that I can not
I can not live never more without you
Without you

Never without you
Without you
Without you
I am nothing without you
Without you"
