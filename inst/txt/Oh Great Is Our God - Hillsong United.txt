"1" "Oh! Great Is Our God
Hillsong United

The splendour of the king, clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice, let all the earth rejoice
He wraps himself in light, and darkness tries to hide
It trembles at his voice

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God
All will see how great, how great is our God

Age to age he stands and time is in his hands
Beggining and the end, beggining and the end
The God-head three in one, father, spirit, son
The lion and the lamb, the lion and the lamb

His name is above all names
You are worthy of our praise
My heart will sing how great is our God"
