[Mali]
Give me that joy I can't explain
Add extra peace that'll ease my pain
I want that love that'll never change
Give me that, Give me that

Give me that power to walk away
When another god wants to take your place
As much of you as I can take
Give me that, Give me that

[2x]

[Mali]

and I choose you today, cuz i need you today
I cant get away
See, there's no escape
See what you done to me
I'm not the same ol' me
You took away everything
Now you're my everything

[choir sings]
I choose you today, cuz i need you today

See, there's no escape
See what you done to me
I'm not the same ol' me

[Mali]

Give me that God that breathes life into nostrils of man
A sovereign god who predestined creation before time began
I want a God who would really add some elegance, decorate the darkness with stars
The God who orchestrates the future, at the same time He knows where you are
Give that God who supplies my needs 'cause he owns all the cattle on the hills
And He's the God that wipes my tears, and provides enough to pay all my bills
Gimmie me that god, that's the God I'm talking bout
Gimmie me that god, that's the God I'm talking bout
Give me that, Give me that
Give me that, Give me that

[choir]

Gimme that joy I can't explain
Add extra peace that'll ease my pain
I want that love that'll never change
Give me that, Give me that

Give me that power to walk away
When another god wants to take your place
As much of you as I can take
Give me that, Give me that

Gimme that joy I can't explain
I'm so happy, you make me happy
Gimme that joy I can't
Add extra peace that'll Add extra peace, ease my pain
I want that love that'll never change
Give me that, Give me that, Give me that ......"
