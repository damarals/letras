"1" "Let Freedom Ring
Gaither Vocal Band

Deep within the heart has always known
That there was freedom
Somehow breathed into the very soul alive
The prisoner, the powerless,
The slave have always known it
There's something that keeps reaching for the sky

Even life begins because a baby fights for freedom
And songs we love to sing have freedom's theme
Some have walked through fire
And flood to find a place of freedom
And some faced hell itself for freedom's dream

Let freedom ring wherever minds know
What it means to be in chains
Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets
Where prisons have no key
We can be free and we can sing
Let freedom ring

God built freedom into every fiber of creation
And He meant for us to all be free and whole
When my Lord bought freedom
With the blood of His redemption
His cross stamped pardon on my very soul

I'll sing it out with every breath,
I'll let the whole world hear it
This hallelujah anthem of the free
That iron bars and heavy chains
Can never hold us captive
The Son has made us free and free indeed

Let freedom ring down through the ages
From a hill called Calvary
Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets
Where prisons have no key
You can be free and you can sing let freedom ring
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets
Where prisons have no key
You can be free and you can sing let freedom ring
You can be free and you can sing
Let freedom ring, let freedom ring."
