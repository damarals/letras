Hillsong United

Here I am
Humbled by Your majesty
Covered by Your grace so free
Here I am
Knowing I’m a sinful man
Covered by the blood of the Lamb

Now I’ve found
The greatest love of all is mine
Since You laid down Your life
The greatest sacrifice

Majesty, majesty
Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty handed but alive in Your hands
Majesty, majesty
Forever I am changed by Your love
In the presence of Your majesty

Here I stand
Humbled by the love that You give
Forgiven so that I can forgive
Here I stand
Knowing that I’m Your desire
Sanctified by glory and fire
And now I’ve found

Now I’ve found
The greatest love of all is mine
Since You laid down Your life
The greatest sacrifice"
