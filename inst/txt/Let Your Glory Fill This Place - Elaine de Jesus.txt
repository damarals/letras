"1" "Let Your Glory Fill This Place
Elaine de Jesus

Let your glory fill this place
Let your glory fill this place
Let your presence inhabit our worship and praise
Let your glory fill this place

As our reasonable service of worship
We're Your living sacrifice
We're so hungry just for you
In our praise Lord, come abide
For where two or three are gathered
You promised You'd be there
Lord, our hearts are open, our spirits broken
Oh hear our earnest prayer

Let your glory fill this place
Let your glory fill this place
Let your presence inhabit our worship and praise
Let your glory fill this place

We're not asking for You to come
Just to meet our wants and needs
We are longing, thirsting for You
Just to lay at Your feet
We found that in your presence
There is fullness of joy
And at Your wonderful right hand
There are pleasures forever more

(Oh, Holy Spirit! Oh, Holy Spirit...)

My heart cries out! My soul cries out! Oh How I need you!
To fill my heart, my life, my soul

Holy Spirit come fill us
Touch us, change us,
Rearrange us
Heal us, free us
Lord, we seek Your face
Wash us, cleanse us, please forgive us,
Mold us, make us,
Come and shake us
Lord, let Your glory fill this place.(3x)"
