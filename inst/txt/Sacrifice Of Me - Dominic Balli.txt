"1" "Sacrifice Of Me
Dominic Balli

Why do I do the things
that I do
When I do to you,
what I don’t want to no
ItÂ’s the mystery of how I be inside of me that’s been killing me from the day my mom and dad made me
When my lips speak
“I’m loving you”
Is it really true,
if I turn around and just hate you
And do you still want me, if it’s a broken me
Is it all of me,
if it’s just part of me

Come and now take all of me ways

Some of them wrong
run em out thee gaze
Show me your face your grace
surroundin me foundin me makin that love abound in me
My ways some of them wrong run em out thee gaze
Show me your ways and they confoundin me, groundin me,
makin that love abound in me

Never to fear tomorrow
He's takin all my sorrows, they run away

My flesh gonna fist fight to the bite of death
Till the end of Babylon come already undone and underway

Why can't I do the things
I want to do
All these things for you,
it seems I cannot do
It's the man crucified with you upon that tree who
I used to be, he tries to make believe he still rules me
To understand the man that
I am is to comprehend, before my time in life had began
This man you see, born in slavery
Who will deliver me,
please deliver me

There's a war going on,
I fight the flesh
It's life or death,
freedom for a wretch a mess
Listen
Back against the wall, stumble and you fall quicker
Retreat from it, when you feed it then it grows bigger
Who can deliver me, honestly, I can feel it inside of me
Raging on in my members and grabbing hold of me violently
Where can I turn Lord, from my own sin
Is this all you ask cause this is all I am

All you want is all I am
All I am is all I have
All you want is all I am
But all I am is all I've got to give
It's all It've got to give
It's all It've got to give

Take me this sacrifice of me
It may be broken,it's all of me now
Take me this sacrifice of me
It may be broken,it's all of me now
I feel like I'am falling now indefinitely
I feel it something deep down it's like it's calling me
Get up, get out, but Lord seriously if what you wants I got a sacrifice of me."
