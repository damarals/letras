"1" "Heaven's Joy Awaits
Gaither Vocal Band

When We Leave This Low Land
We Will Cross The Jordan
Pass This Chilling Torrent
Heaven's Joy Awaits

Heaven Is Just Beyond The Blue Horizon
Just Above The Starry Sky, Starry Blue Sky
Far Above This Land Of Sorrow
Way Above Each Tear And Sigh, Every Sigh

Just A Few More Miles Before Us
Just A Little While To Wait, Patiently Wait
Soon We'll Sing Redemptions Chorus
Heaven's Joy Awaits, Heaven Awaits

Heaven's Breeze Is Blowing
Gently To Recalling
I Will Soon Be Going
Through The Pearly Gates

Heaven Is Just Beyond The Blue Horizon
Just Above The Starry Sky, Starry Blue Sky
Far Above This Land Of Sorrow
Way Above Each Tear And Sigh, Every Sigh

Just A Few More Miles Before Us
Just A Little While To Wait, Patiently Wait
Soon We'll Sing Redemptions Chorus
Heaven's Joy Awaits, Heaven Awaits"
