"1" "I Just Need You
Coral Resgate Para Vida

I will bow down
And surrender all
For your love lord
For me

Anything lord
I just need you
Oh lord

In my life lord
In my home lord
I just need you
Oh lord

I am nothing
But my life I give
Let my life song praise to you
Let my life song praise to you

Lord,we praise you
Lord, we bow down
Lord, please lord
Lord, we just need you."
