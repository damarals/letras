"1" "Dearly Loved
Jimmy Needham

(Matthew 11:28)
Please lay down your arrows
For they?re sure to pierce the skin
And water from a broken well
Will make you thirst again
When all things you?ve acquired
Are tested by the flames
And you can see them melting
Then will you call his name

It?s worth it brothers
It?s worth it friends
To know your maker
To lose your sin
Did you know that you are dearly loved

To the slaughters you are being led
Being told that it?s a party
That this God is in your head
And every single lie
Sounds just like the greatest truth
But the one truth you?re not hearing
Is that he died for you

No greater joy
No greater peace
No greater love than this

It?s worth it brothers
It?s worth it friends
To know your maker
To lose your sin
Did you know that you are dearly loved"
