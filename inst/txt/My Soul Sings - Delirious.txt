"1" "My Soul Sings
Delirious

Open my eyes to see
The wonderful mystery of love
Falling into you
I’m drawn to the gravity of love

We’re standing still in a moment of eternity
Where worlds collide and I feel the breath of heaven over me

My soul sings x3
How I love you / oh I love you

Open the page and see
The wonderful history of love
I start and end with you
I’m pulled to the gravity of love"
