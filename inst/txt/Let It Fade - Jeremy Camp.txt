"x"
"1" "Let It Fade
Jeremy Camp

Have you been walking on a surface that's uncertain
Have you helped yourself to everything that's empty
You can't live,
This way too long,
There's more than this,
More than this

Have you been standing on your own feet too long
Have you been looking for a place where you belong
You can rest,
You will find rest

[CHORUS]
Let this old life crumble,
Let it fade,
Let this new life offered be your saving grace,
Let this old life crumble let it fade,
Let it fade

Have you been holding on to what this world has offered
Have you been giving in to all these masquerades it will be gone,
It will be gone

[CHORUS]

Are you carrying the weight too much,
Are you running from the call

[CHORUS]"
