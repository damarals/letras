Verse 1
One hope for all our lives
Your truth remains through time
Love is the way
You gave Your life away
We now receive new life
Our eyes are opened wide
You made a way for us
Chorus:
When the world fails we'll be standing
On the one name thats never failing
We receive new life as we surrender
In You we know we've found THE ANSWER
Verse 2:
In You we find our place
Your will for all our days
Never to fade
Your love will light the way
Our hearts are for your cause
We live beyond ourselves
And let Your love be known
Bridge
We live to see You
We long to know Your love
Our hearts are open
Our lives are yours forever"
