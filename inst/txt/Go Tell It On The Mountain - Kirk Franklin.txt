"1" "Go Tell It On The Mountain
Kirk Franklin

Go Tell it on The Mountain
Over The Hills and Everywhere
Go Tell it on The Mountain
That Jesus Christ is Born

I Want you to go
Tell them he's a healer
I Want you to go
Tell them he's our Savior and Master

Oh, go tell it
Tell them he's a deliverer
Tell it, go tell it
That Jesus Christ is born
Oh, go tell it
Tell it, go tell it

That Jesus Christ, is born"
