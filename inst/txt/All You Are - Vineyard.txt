"1" "All You Are
Vineyard

All that's good, and
All that's right
All that's beautiful in life

All that's pure, and
All that's true
It all begins and ends in You, and

Every star in the sky
Joins in thanks, and we reply, for

Chorus:
All You are, and
All You've been
We say thank You once again, for
All You are, and
All You'll be
We will worship endlessly, for
All You are"
