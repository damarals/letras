"1" "I Will Not Be Shaken
Delirious

I will declare my voice
To the nations
Shout for joy
To the congregation
I will worship God
All my days
Those who love the Lord
Are satisfied
Those who trust in him
Are justified
I will serve my God
All my days

CHORUS:
When the nations crumble
The Word of the Lord will stand
Kings may rise and fall
His love will endure
Though the strong may stumble
The joy of the Lord is strength
To my soul
I will not be shaken
I will not be moved
I will not be shaken"
