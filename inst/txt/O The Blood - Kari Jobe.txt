"1" "O The Blood
Kari Jobe

Oh the blood, Crimson love
Price of life's demand
Shameful sin
Placed on Him
The Hope of every man

O the blood of Jesus washes me
O the blood of Jesus washes me
What a sacrifice that saved my life?
Yes, the blood, it's my victory

Savior Son, Holy One
Slain so I can live
See the Lamb
The great I Am
Who takes away my sin

O the blood of Jesus washes me
O the blood of Jesus washes me
What a sacrifice that saved my life?
Yes, the blood, it's my victory

Oh the blood of the Lamb!
Oh the blood of the Lamb!
Oh the blood of the Lamb!
The precious blood of the Lamb
What a sacrifice that saved my life?
Yes, the blood, it's my victory

Oh what love, no greater love
Gracce, how can it be
That in my sin
Yes, even then
He shed His blood for me

O the blood of Jesus washes me
O the blood of Jesus washes me
What a sacrifice that saved my life?
Yes, the blood, it's my victory

What a sacrifice that saved my life?
Yes, the blood, it's my victory

Thank for Your Blood!
Come on and thank You
Oh thank You
Thank for Blood
Thank for Your Love
Thank You Lord!
Thank You, thank You, thank You!"
