Comunidade Cat√≥lica Shalom

On this altar are
Lives, fruits, gifts, and hearts
Being offered up to You
Songs, a feast, a ring
The Father waiting
All ready to celebrate

Oh, Infinite Love
Oh, how we feel so overwhelmed
Everything we have we want to give
All you've given us, out of love
Will ever be all Yours, oh Lord

Father, in Your embrace
Our lives are renewed
There is where we the sinner finds peace
Freely we've received what we now want to give
On the altar with the bread and wine
You magnify our nothingness
You magnify our nothingness
