"1" "Close To You
Youthful Praise

Lord I love you, How I love you
More and more each day
I just want to be close close to you

Under the shadow of your wing
Please hide me, Lord
So that I might be close close to you

In your presence is fullness of joy, of joy
At your right hand are pleasures forevermore
No evil can stand where you are
So I just need to be close, close to you"
