For Today

Burn it down!
I see the dawning of a movement
Of the kids who won't concede
To a culture of deception
And a spark is all we need
I see the dawning of a movement
Of the kids who won't concede
To a culture of deception; and a spark is all we need
To see a revolution in a culture
That's living a lie
Still, this is our generation
And still, we will not watch it die

Out in the streets we run, with the fire of conviction
And we let it shine
We burn every structure down, t
Hat stands for our destruction
Liberate your mind!
And we will always believe
They can see our banner waving high
So let your fire burn tonight
And as the city sleeps, in the empty streets
There's a flame lighting up the sky!

There is a system designed to destroy us
We'll send it back to hell!
I'll watch it burn to the ground
Burn it down!
I'll watch it burn to the ground
And freedom will rise from the ashes

Burn it down!
I see the dawning of a movement
Of the kids who won't concede
To a culture of deception
And a spark is all we need
I see the dawning of a movement
Of the kids who won't concede
To a culture of deception
And a spark is all we need
To see a revolution in a culture
That's living a lie
Still, this is our generation
And still, we will not watch it die

And we will always believe
They can see our banner waving high
So let your fire burn tonight
And as the city sleeps, In the empty streets
There's a flame lighting up the sky!
They can see our banner waving high
So let your fire burn tonight
And as the city sleeps, in the empty streets
There's a flame we see burning bright!"
