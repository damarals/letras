Jeremy Camp

In only a moment truth was seen
Revealed this mystery
The crown that showed no dignity he wore
And the king was placed for all the world to show disgrace
But only beauty flowed from this place

Would you take the place of this man?
Would you take the nails from his hands?
Would you take the place of this man?
Would you take the nails from his hands?

He held the weight of impurity
The Father would not see
The reasons had finally come to be to show
The depth of His grace flowed with every sin erased
He knew that this was why he came

Would you take the place of this man?
Would you take the nails from his hands?
Would you take the place of this man?
Would you take the nails from his hands?

And we just don't know
The blood and water flowed
And in it all He shows
Just how much He cares

And the veil was torn
So we could have this open door
And all these things have finally been complete

Would you take the place of this man?
Would you take the nails from his hands?
Would you take the place of this man?
Would you take the nails from his hands,
from his hands, from his hands, from his hands"
