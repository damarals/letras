"1" "Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee
Michael W. Smith

Joyful, joyful we adore Thee
God of glory, Lord of love
Heart unfold like flowers before thee
Opening to the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light of day

Repeat Verse 1

Chorus:
Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long till I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Just call on your brother
When you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem
That you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on (lean on me)

All thy words with joy surround thee
Earth and heaven reflect thy rays
Stars and angels sing around thee
Center of unbroken praise
Field and forest, vale and mountain
Flow'ring meadow, flashing sea
Chanting bird and flowing fountain
Call us to rejoice in thee

Call me (call me)
Call me (call me)
Call me (call me in the morning)
Call me (even in the noontime)
Call me (call me in the evening) (joyful, joyful we adore thee)
Call me (late at night) (God of glory, Lord of love)
Call me (you don't have to be ashamed, 'cause I know you know my number) (joyful, joyful we adore thee)
Call me (God of glory, Lord of love)
Call me (you can call me)
Call me (when you need me)
Call me (when you need a friend, call me)
Call me (when you got it out, call me)

Joyful, joyful we adore thee
God of glory, Lord of love
Joyful, Joyful we adore thee
God of glory, Lord of love"
