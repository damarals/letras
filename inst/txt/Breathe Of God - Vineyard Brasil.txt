"1" "Breathe Of God
Vineyard Brasil

Breathe on me, breath of God
My spirit yearns for You
Hide me in Your fathering arms
Fill up my longing soul

Flood over me like a river, my God
Immerse me in Your living stream
Awaken the song
That You placed in my heart
Spirit, breathe on me
Spirit, breathe on me

Breathe on me, breath of God
Burn bright, eternal fire
Father, draw me near to Your heart
You are my one desire"
