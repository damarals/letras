"1" "Feels Like
Jeremy Camp

I fail in every single way
But everytime I hear You say
Faithful One come in to
This place of rest where You belong

I anticipate the final day
When I fall into Your warm embrace
Whit everything that I've been through
Nothing else compares

And it feels like
All these tears are coming through
When I think of You do
And it feels like
All this joy is bleeding through
When I think of seeing You

I complicate this very state
Of resting in what You create
Nothing goes out Your control
You've given me this very soul

You cared enough to take my place
And given me unending grace
I know that You know every need
That's my security

Bridge:
All Your ways are so mysterious
Never far Your ear to hear us
I'll never thirst from this drink that You give

Hallelujah
