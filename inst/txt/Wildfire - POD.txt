"1" "Wildfire
P.O.D.

Come and give that wildfire
The uncivilized sound that I love
The primitive ragga blaze style
Consciousness vibes I and I know
The untamed flame that I desire
Me want uncultivated jah glow
Foolish intensity, versatile
Fly the espirt high, take me higher

One leads with the passion
The righteous will burn again
One bleeds everlasting
Tribal fire will never end

I want to feel that wildfire
Irregular burning the sun
Shining through make you sipit fire
Savage combustion, let it go
Impetuous fervor testifier
Outlandish passions I know
Crucial rhythms no denial
Musical nation, empire"
