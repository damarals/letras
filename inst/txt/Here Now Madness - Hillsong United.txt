"1" "Here Now (Madness)
Hillsong United

Skies spin their dance within Your breath
Time runs its race within Your hand
My mind runs wild to comprehend
What no mind on earth Could understand

Your ways are higher
Your thoughts are wilder
Love came like madness
Poured out in blood - wash romance
It makes no sense but this is grace
And I know You're with me in this place

Here now
All I know is I know that You are
Here now
Still my heart
Let your voice be all I  Hear now
Spirit breathe
Like the wind come have Your way
Cause I know You're in this place

Faith makes a fool Of what makes sense
But grace found my heart where logic ends
When justice called for all my debts
The Friend of singres came instead

Your ways are higher
Your thoughts are wilder
Love came like madness
Poured out in blood - wash romance
It makes no sense but this is grace
And I know You're with me in this place


Here now
All I know is I know that You are
Here now
Still my heart
Let your voice be all I  Hear now
Spirit breathe
Like the wind come have Your way

Cause I know then You're
Here now
Heart and soul
God I know that You are here now
Fix my eyes
On the things that I can't see now
And all I see
Is the glory of Your name

Cause I know then You're
Here now
Still my heart
Let your voice be all I
Hear now
Fix my eyes
On the things that I can't see now
Spirit breathe
Like the wind come have Your way

Cause I know then You're
Here now
Still my heart
Let your voice be all I
Hear now
Fix my eyes
On the things that I can't see now
Spirit breathe
Like the wind come have Your way

Cause I know then You're
Here now
...
 ...

Ohh... Spirit breathe
Like the wind come...

Cause I know then You're
Here now
Still my heart
Let your voice be all I
Hear now
Fix my eyes
On the things that I can't see now
Spirit breathe
Like the wind come have Your way"
