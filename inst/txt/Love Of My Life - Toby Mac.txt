"1" "Love Of My Life
Toby Mac

I climbed this mountain just to tell you
This thing is movin' from my head down to my heart
And, oh, you know how much I need you (nee-need you-you)
Need you to be my flash of lightning in the dark (oh o-oh o-oh)
So lost without you (oh o-oh o-oh)

You are the fire that I feel inside (I feel inside)
You are the stars on my blackest night (blackest night)
You are the beat in this heart of mine (this heart of mine)
You are the love (love, love) of my life

You got me singin' like
Oh o-oh o-oh
You got me feelin' like
Oh o-oh o-oh
You keep me honest like
Oh o-oh o-oh
You are the love, you are the love of my life
Oh o-oh o-oh

You set the path that lies before me (-fore-fore me)
And then you make it straight, a beautiful mystery
Well, you make it well within my soul, oh (soul, oh)
Oh, so countless are my reasons to believe (oh o-oh o-oh)
So lost without you, yeah

You are the fire that I feel inside (I feel inside)
You are the stars on my blackest night (blackest night)
You are the beat in this heart of mine (this heart of mine)
You are the love (love, love) of my life

You got me singin' like
Oh o-oh o-oh
You got me feelin' like
Oh o-oh o-oh
You keep me honest like
Oh o-oh o-oh
You are the love, you are the love of my life

You-you got me singin' like
You-you got me singin' like
Hey!

L-l-l-looks like I'm done for
This heart is all yours
Nothing could be sweeter, swee-sweeter
There's a river to you
L-l-l-looks like I'm done for
This heart is all yours (hey!)
Nothing could be sweeter, swee-sweeter
There's a river to you

My life (my life) , this love (this love)
I'll never be the man that I was
I-I-I remember the first time I met you (met you)
My heart raged, jumped out my earth suit
A little punk (yeah) from dc (uh huh)
But then you wrapped your arms around me
Now mama gave me some good advice
Said go find the love of your life

You are the fire that I feel inside (I feel inside) (hey!)
You are the stars on my blackest night (blackest night)
You are the beat in this heart of mine (this heart of mine) (hey!)
You are the love (love, love) of my life

You got me singin' like (hey!)
Oh o-oh o-oh
You got me feelin' like (hey!)
Oh o-oh o-oh
You keep me honest like (hey!)
Oh o-oh o-oh
You are the love (hey!) , you are the love of my life
Oh o-oh o-oh"
