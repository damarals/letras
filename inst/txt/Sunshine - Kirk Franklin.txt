"x"
"1" "Sunshine
Kirk Franklin

You bring the sun out you make my love grow

Your the reason that I'm livin I was hurtin' but I'm happy again
You were there when i had nothing you've been with me from beginning to end

No clouds in the sky that's the reason why (I love you)

Question #1 What can I do?
Question #2 What can I say?

To try to let you know:
I appreciate all of the ways you get me through my day

Never would have thought:
I would be hear

A heart with no scars:
A face with no tears

How can I thank you:
How can I show you wish i could get the whole world to know you

If they only knew:
You are the one who gives me the air to breathe

And see I can't deny:
Your the reason why my life has a melody

And even when I stray:
Still you always pulling me close to you

So no matter where you are just no I'm not far:
Without you what would I do

You bring the sun out
Your the reason why I'm livin
I was hurtin now I'm happy again
You bring the sun out
You make my love grow
You bring the sun out
You were there when I had nothing
Now you're with me from beginning to end
You bring the sun out
You make my love grow
You bring the sun out

No clouds in the sky that's the reason why:
I love you

Question #3 Where would I be? How could you see?

My days and my nights the pains in my life but now it's alright 'cause:
You worked it out for me

You gave me a chance when:
I had no chance

And when I needed help you:
You gave me your hand

So now they need to see just what you mean to me and if you ever left me:
Where would I be

You are the one who gives me the air to breathe

And see I can't deny:

Your the reason why my life has a melody and

And even if I stray:

Still your always pulling me close to you

So no matter where you are just know I'm not far:

Without you what would I do

Bridge

I feel your sunlight on my life
reminding me that it is alright
and I see the wind blow and I know
my storm has finally passed away
There is a south wind that begins
to blow back the clouds so I can see
Your perfect plan now I can hurry to my destiny

ooh ha ha can you clap your hands
ooh ha ha can you calp your hands"
