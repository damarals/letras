"1" "Children Of The Light
Hillsong United

Children in the wilderness
Following the love You poured out for us
Covered by the Name that we confess
Jesus Saviour forever

Roaming through the dark of night
Clinging to the word that burns deep inside
Eyes fixed on Your Name and endless light
Jesus Saviour forever

Set a light to follow
In the shadow of Your Name
The world is Yours and I know
Everything will find its place
Under Your Name

Walking on through the fire
Knowing I will not be burned but refined
Fearless in Your Name ever by my side
Jesus Saviour forever

Taking on the raging storm
Anchored to Your kingdom unshakeable
Holding to the Name that outshines all
Jesus Saviour forever

Children of the light
Blazing through the night
Taking back what the devil had stolen
Calling on the Name
Breaking every chain
Jesus everlasting freedom

Running through the wild
Dancing in the fire
Taking back what the devil had stolen
Calling on the Name
Breaking every chain
Jesus everlasting freedom

All the power all the glory
All the praise be to Your Name forever
All the power all the glory
All the praise be to Your Name forever"
