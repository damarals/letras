Lecrae

R.I.P. to Medgar Evers, R.I.P. to Dr. King
I ain't tryna hate on my own kind
But Al and Jesse don't speak for me
I'm probably gon catch some flack mayne

But I'ma swallow this pill like Pacman
Some of these folks won't tell the truth
Too busy tryna get them racks mayne
Church tryna rob my paychecks
Choir members probably havin gay sex
Pastor manipulatin hurtin women
I wonder which he's gon slay next
Bookstore pimpin them hope books
Like God don't know how broke looks
And tellin me that I'm gon reap a mill

If I sow into these low crooks
Plus I know ol' girl a freak
Now how she singin a solo
I walked in the church wit a snapback
And they tellin me that that's a \"nono\"?
That's backwords, and I lack words
For these actors called pastors
All these folks is hypocrites

And that's why I ain't at church
Truthfully I'm just doin me
And I don't wanna face no scrutiny
As long as the church keep wildin' out
I can justify all my foolish deeds
Smokin weed, pourin up
Keep that 'lade up in my cup
Maybe I could change the world
But this porn on my laptop got me stuck

Yeah I know whats right from wrong
But that there ain't gon sell a song
I rather sell my soul than save it
If that's what make my money long
It better not be no real God
With real hope, that heals hearts
That shows me that I ain't livin up
To all the things that He put me here for
It better not be no real church

Real saints, who pray hard
And let me rock my snapback
With the 501s and the J's on
It better not be no real folk
Who don't think that they better than you
Straight or gay, drunk or high
They walk through the cold weather wit chu
Nah we don't wanna see that

Cause that might mean \"life change\"
That might mean I'm worth more
Than money, cars, sex, and pipe dreams
Better not be no real Jesus
Real forgiveness, for hurt folks
If God gon take me as I am
I guesss I already got on my Church Clothes"
