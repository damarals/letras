"1" "Help Is On The Way (Maybe Midnight)
Toby Mac

It may be midnight or mid-day
He's never early, never late
He will stand by what He claimed
I lived enough life to say

I heard your heart, I see your pain
Out in the dark, out in the rain
Feels so alone, feels so afraid
I heard you pray in Jesus' name

It may be midnight or mid-day
He's never early, never late
He will stand by what He claimed
I lived enough life to say (say, say, say)

Help is on the way
Roundin' the corner
Help is on the way
Comin' for ya
Help is on the way
Yea-ee-ayy
I lived enough life to say
Help is on the way

Sometimes it's days, sometimes it's years (Oh-oh)
Some face a lifetime of fallen tears (Oh-oh)
But He's in the darkness, He's in the cold
Just like the mornin', He always shows (He always shows)

It may be midnight or mid-day
He's never early, never late
He will stand by what He claimed
I lived enough life to say (say, say, say)

Help is on the way
Roundin' the corner
Help is on the way
Comin' for ya
Help is on the way
Yea-ee-ayy
I lived enough life to say
Help is on the way

(Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Well, I seen my share o' troubles
But the Lord ain't failed me yet
So I'm holdin' onto the promise, y'all
That He's rollin' up His sleeves again
Said, I seen my share of troubles (Rollin' up, rollin' up)
But the Lord ain't failed me yet (Rollin' up, rollin' up)
We'll keep holdin' onto the promise, y'all (Rollin' up, rollin' up)
That He's rollin' up His sleeves again

Rollin' up, rollin' up (Don't ya know it?)
Rollin' up His sleeves again (I can see Him rollin')
Rollin' up, rollin' up (Help is comin')
Rollin' up His sleeves again

Yeah, it may be midnight or mid-day (Yeah-eah)
He's never early, no, never late (Yeah-eah)
He will stand by what He claimed (Yeah-eah)
I lived enough life to say... (Say, say, say)

It may be midnight or mid-day (Yeah-eah)
He's never early, no, He's never late (Yeah-eah)
He will stand by what He claimed (Yeah-eah)
I lived enough life to say (say, say, say)

Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Roundin' the corner
Help is on the way"
