"1" "Shadows
Red

The sun is set, I close my eyes
I pretend everything is alright
Drowning in anger
For all these lies
I can't pretend everything is alright
Please don't let me fall forever
Can you tell me is over now?

There's a hate inside of me
Like some kind of master
I try to save you
But I can't find the answer
I'm holding onto you
I'll never let go
I need you with me
As I enter the shadows

Charter in darkness
I go blind
Can you help me find my way out?
Nobody hears me
I suffer the silence
Can you tell me is over now?

There's a hate inside of me
Like some kind of master
I try to save you
But I can't find the answer
I'm holding onto you
I'll never let go
I need you with me
As I enter the shadows

I'm holding on to you
I'm holding on to you

There's a hate inside of me
Like some kind of master
I try to save you
But I can't find the answer
I'm holding onto you
I'll never let go
I need you with me
As I enter the shadows"
