"1" "Take My Love
Dominic Balli

Take my lovin’ take all of me
Take my lovin’ take all of me
Take my lovin’ take all take all of me

Take my love take my love
Take my sweet sweet love
‘Till I got no love to give
All my love all my love
All my sweet sweet love
‘Till I got no love to give

I knew I was in trouble when I seen her ‘pon the dance floor
She captivate my heart with just a single glance her
Eyes of chocolate were holding me for ransom
A sweet surrender of my love and my romancin’
I knew she was the one when she stole all of my lovin’
And so I rolled up on the floor and I said

Well you could prolly guess what happened next I finally caught her
She took my heart and we departed to the altar
A love for sure need nothing more than what we started
Eternal bliss and Heaven’s blessing took us farther
She knew I was the one when I stole all of her lovin’
You better believe it rocked my world when she said

All my lovin’ all my lovin’ all my lovin’ all my love
Take my love take my love take my love"
