"1" "Jesus Come Quickly
MercyMe

(Verse)
Jesus come quickly
Jesus sing over us
Jesus look down on us
And smile at what you see
Jesus come quickly
Jesus please hold us tight
Jesus with all your might
For your love will set us free
(Chorus)
Come quickly Lord, oh please show your face
Revive us now from our lifeless state
We need your help oh this world can't wait
Show us your grace and your mercy
Jesus come quickly
