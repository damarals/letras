Casting Crowns

Here in this worn and weary land
Where many a dream has died
Like a tree planted by the water
We never will run dry

So living water flowing through
God we thirst for more of you
Fill our hearts and flood our souls
with one desire

Just to know you and to make you known
We lift your name on high
Shine like the sun make darkness run and hide
We know we were made for so much more
Than ordinary lives
It's time for us to more than just survive
We were made to thrive

Into your word we're digging deep
to know our father's heart
Into the world we're reaching out
To show them who you are
So living water flowing through
God we thirst for more of you
Fill our hearts and flood our souls
With one desire

Just to know you and to make you known
We lift your name on high
Shine like the sun make darkness run and hide
We know we were made for so much more
Than ordinary lives
It's time for us to more than just survive
We were made to thrive

Joy unspeakable
Faith unsinkable
Love unstoppable
Anything is possible

Just to know you and to make you known
We lift your name on high
Shine like the sun make darkness run and hide
We know we were made for so much more
Than ordinary lives
It's time for us to more than just survive
We were made to thrive

We were made to thrive"
