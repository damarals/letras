Hillsong United

You are righteous
You love justice
And those who honour You
Will see Your face
I will arise and lift my eyes
To see Your majesty
Your holiness, and all I am will bless You

My hope is in the Name of the Lord
Where my help comes from
Youâ€™re my strength, my song
My trust is in the Name of the Lord
I will sing Your praise
You are faithful"
