"1" "Bring Back My Best Friend
MÃºsicas Gospel

God, if I could have but just one wish,
And if your powers would make it true.
My wish would go something like this:

My one wish would be bring back my best friend,
And by you doin' this he'd have his smile again.
The devil took over, and he controls his soul.
But if he sees you're involved he'll let him go.

He will change, and quit cheatin' on his wife,
Then he'll go back to the man I used to like.
Please, Lord, won't you chase his demons away?
So once again my brother can have better days.

I'm on my knees as I'm askin' this of you,
Cause it's somethin' that only you can do.
Would you remove his pain, so he'll be okay?
Open up his eyes and send your love his way.

He will change, and quit cheatin' on his wife.
Then he'll go back to the man I used to like.
Please, Lord, won't you chase his demons away?
So once again my brother can have better days.

Please, Lord, won't you chase his demons away?
So once again my brother can have better days."
