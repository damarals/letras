Title: Donna
Autor: Kirk franklin
Album: One Nation Crew (1nc)

Donna was seventeen and
And she had some big dreams
She wanted to be a big star and
Move away out to LA

She's having a rough time now
'Cause she's pregnane with her second child
I'm calling out your name girl just to
Let you know before you go

The storm won't last always
It's gonna be a brighter day
Don't listen to what people might say
The storm won't last always

She's living back with mama now
And her so called friends have let her down
And every night before she sleeps
I can hear her pray
Take my pain away

What ever your going there is
Someone who really cares for you
Say Jesus can take your heart and
Make brand new if you let him in just let him in

The storm won't last always
It's gonna be a brighter day
Don't listen to what people might say
The storm won't last always

Lord I'm so tired of this
Pain and i know that you are the
Only one that i can depend
On right now so if you please help me
Just help

No matter what people say
You can make it anyway
You don't have to be afraid
I know the lord will make a way
All my burdan he will
Gods love will never change

The storm won't last always
It's gonna be a brighter day
Don't listen to what people might say
The storm won't last always"
