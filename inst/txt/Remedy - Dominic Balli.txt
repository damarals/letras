Refrão:
The voices inside keep you up all night
I got the remedy
The poison inside seems to drain all the life out your bones (I got the remedy remedy)

The youth of the world
we keep on dying dying
The children they cry
we keep on crying crying
What a mighty mighty conflict
What a mighty mighty conflict now
What a might mighty conflict
What a mighty conflict now
We agonize until dawn
We scrap but not by sight
Contend in prayer we be strong
Give it up now gots to fight
What a mighty mighty conflict
What a mighty mighty conflict now
What a mighty mighty conflict
What a mighty conflict now

(Refrão)

And so you’re crying out loud
We hear you calling
You try to find your wait out but it seams like nothing coming down
Look up you find your comfort and you’ll find your rest now
In him you’ll find your comfort and you’ll find your rest
The pain is poison inside, you cut to feel alive
No need to suffer the Christ already bled and died
What a mighty mighty conflict
What a mighty mighty conflict now
What a might mighty conflict
What a mighty conflict now

(Refrão)

Time to put it behind decline lies and the voices
Thick of the night if you bite its like poison laced with a little bit of sweet
Defeat creep neatly at your feet knees weak then repeat
You give in cause the feelin your feelin is authentic
Fake but it’s realer than the real presented
Never relents his demented intention
Convincin you the feelin's feelin better than the light of day
But it’s only for a limited time and then you find yourself crying in the still of the night
Not right the pain inside
If you search you find light but the blind sight hinder the light yeah but it ought to be taken for reality
We battle and fight the principalities and powers of a similar like
And now the devil been defeated less you give in the fight
So take it back what you've given cause he aint got the right and now look to the heavens where your help come from
Wait for the morning and the joy will come when the son come-end of the night
I got the remedy
