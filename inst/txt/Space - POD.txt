Verse 1
Here we come
Jah right
And the sight you mighta heard
If the word ain't feelin the streets beat the third
The fourth if ya ready
Ya make my belly get sick
The way you talkin so loud
Who you rollin with
Move coward/You sweet and sour
Let me introduce you to friend of ours
You better look bolth ways before you cross this road
You wanna tangle with the boys
What you watin for
What?

Chorus
If you got something to say
Haha
You better say it
Or don't even look my way (I wantcha to, I wantcha to)
And if you pull that card to play
Haha
You better play it
Cause if not get outa my face
And don't waste my time.

Verse 2
Street tested
Tangle through
Make your move
My crew we wanna prove
From the bottom to the top
Top to the bottom
We got em lock
And lock is how we got em
Gave birth to this game
Pay dues for his name
If your trains about to end
And I'm gonna send it away
I was built for this role
And I own it
I take the plane
Keep talkin real big and watch me do big things
What?

Chorus
If you got something to say
Haha
You better say it
Or don't even look my way (I wantcha to, I wantcha to)
And if you pull that card to play
Haha
You better play it
Cause if not get outa my face
And don't waste my time.

Bridge

Chorus
If you got something to say
Haha
You better say it
Or don't even look my way (I wantcha to, I wantcha to)
And if you pull that card to play
Haha
You better play it
Cause if not get outa my face
And don't waste my time.

(I wantcha to, I wantcha to,I wantcha to, I wantcha to,I wantcha to, I wantcha to)
