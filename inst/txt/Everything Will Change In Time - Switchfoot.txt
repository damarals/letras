"1" "Everything Will Change In Time
Switchfoot

Say hello to the ones and the zeros on the internet
Walk around, take a good stare down tomorrow
Here we are wide-eyed in the shadow of the infinite
The infinite

Well you've got your reasons and I've got mine
But I'm not believing the hype this time
We stop and go for the same old thing
Living for the old deadlines

Tomorrow knows what tomorrow will bring
Everything will change in time
And everything is changing
Say hello, we're the kids on the corner of the decadent
But I'm looking for a place that money can't buy me
Selling out that flash and pass for the prominent

For the prominent
Hey, what about nixon and his old crew?
We settle for one thing and everything's through
We stop and go for the same old thing
Living for the old deadlines
Tomorrow knows what tomorrow will bring

Everything will change in time
Everything is changing
Here we are wide-eyed in the shadow of the infinite, the infinite
Here we are wide-eyed in the shadow of the infinite
Here we are wide-eyed in the shadow of the infinite, the infinite
We stop and go for the same old thing

Living for the old deadlines
Tomorrow knows what tomorrow will bring
Everything will change in time
We stop and go for the same old thing
Living for the old deadlines
Tomorrow knows what tomorrow will bring
Everything will change in time
Everything is changing"
