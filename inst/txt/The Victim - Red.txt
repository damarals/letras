"1" "The Victim
Red

And this is what you get
When you compel the pain
And this is where you rest
Above a glowing flame

I'll see you for what you are
I'll free you, I'll watch you fall

And you take
Take

Need the needing
Want the wanting
Victim, the victim
Live for dying
Sanctified
The victim, victim

And this is who you are
A figment of yourself
And this is where you fall
Beneath the lowest hell

I see you, nowhere to hide
Rip out your heart, crawl back inside

And you take
Take

Need the needing
Want the wanting
Victim, the victim
Live for dying
Crucified
The victim, victim

Parade of martyrs
March to the slaughter
Invent a mission
Believe your fiction

You are the only one you're saving
There's nothin' left but still you're taking
Still you take, take
Take, take, take, take"
