"x"
"1" "Lifetime
Switchfoot

I wake up, put my poker face on
It’s roughly the same hand
I was dealt yesterday
I stand up and stare out at the skyline
It’s roughly the same town
That I saw yesterday

Living doesn’t come first try
It takes a lifetime getting it right
It takes a lifetime to learn how to sing
To find my place in the worlds symphony
To become the man today
The man I thought I could be

It takes a lifetime
It takes a lifetime

I wake up and bandage these scars
The scars of my heart
That prove that I’m still alive
That I’m still alive
Living doesn’t come first try
It takes a lifetime getting it right

Living doesn’t come first try
It takes a lifetime getting it right
It takes a lifetime to learn how to sing
To find my place in the worlds symphony
To become the man today
The man I thought I could be
The man I thought I could be

It takes a lifetime
It takes a lifetime"
