"1" "For Those Who Wait
Fireflight

Another day another waiting game
A little different but it's still the same
I am here but where's the one I'm longing for
I'm having troubles feeling all alone
When my heart find a home
I want to hope but sometimes I just don't know
I know I'm not the only one

(Chorus)
So you sing a lullaby
To the lonely hearts tonight
Let it set Your heart on fire
Let it set You free
When you're fighting to believe in a love that you
can't see
Just know there is a purpose
For those who wait

I want to open up my eyes
I know that I'm in need is time
I'm growing stronger every single day
God, I'm gonna lead them to You now
Letting go all of my fear and doubt
I can't do this on my own so I'll give You control
I know I'm not the only one

(Chorus)
So you sing a lullaby
To the lonely hearts tonight
Let it set Your heart on fire
Let it set You free
When you're fighting to believe in a love that you
can't see
Just know there is a purpose
For those who wait

The pressure makes us stronger
The struggle makes us hunger
The hard lessons make the difference
The pressure makes us stronger
The struggle makes us hunger
The hard lessons make the difference
And the difference makes it worth it

(Chrous)
So you sing a lullaby
To the lonely hearts tonight
Let it set Your heart on fire
Let it set You free
When you're fighting to believe in a love that you
can't see
Just know there is a purpose
For those who wait

Set your heart on fire
This is for those who wait"
