Hillsong United

Here's to the One who made the morning bright
Here's to the One who taught the stars to shine
Here's to the One who graced
the dead of nightpulled me
from the dark set my heart alight

Here's to the One who made my heart to sing
Opened up my eyes washed away my sin
Here's to the One who gave His life for mine
Broke all my chains and set me free alright

To the Way
To the Truth
To the life I live in the light You give
Jesus here's to Your Name over everything

Here's to all the things that Your love has done
Here's to the way You wiped away my past
Here's to the future and the things to come
Here's to my Saviour's everlasting love

To the Way
To the Truth
To the life I live in the light You give
Jesus here's to Your Name over everything

Here's to Your kindness
Here's to Your goodness
Here's to Your freedom
Here's to the day I see You Jesus

Here's to Your glory
Here's to Your greatness
Here's to Your kingdom
Here's to the Name of Jesus

To the Way
To the Truth
To the life I live in the light You give
Jesus here's to Your Name over everything

To the Way
To the Truth
To the life I live in the light You give
Jesus here's to Your Name over everything

Here's to our Saviour
Here's to the Name of Jesus"
