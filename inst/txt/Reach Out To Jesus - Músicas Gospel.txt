"1" "Reach Out To Jesus
MÃºsicas Gospel

He's always there hearing every prayer faithful and true
Walking by our side in his love we hide all the day through
When you get discouraged just remember what to do
Reach out to Jesus he's reaching out to you

Is the life you're living filled with sorrow and dispair?
Does the future press you with its worry and its scare?
Are you tired and jealous, have you almost your way?
Jesus will help you, just talk to him today"
