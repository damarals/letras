Oh! Happy day
Oh! Happy day

When Jesus wash
When Jesus wash
When Jesus wash

All my sins away
Oh! Happy day

He takes all my sins away
He taught me how to walk
Fight and pray, Fight and pray
And live rejoice everyday
Every day Everyday

Oh! Happy day
Oh! Happy day

When Jesus wash
When Jesus wash
When Jesus wash

All my sins away
Oh! Happy day"
