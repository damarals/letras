"1" "Mountain's High
Delirious

By TeteuCS

Sorrow came to visit us today
Was the longest day, was the loneliest day
Sorrow came to steal our hope away
Only tears can tell
Of this holy hour

This mountain’s high, too high for us
This mountain’s high, too high for us
Too high

Sorrow came quicker than a fire
Was the longest day, was the loneliest day
I feel your hand, the warmth, your sweetest smile
But you slipped away, through the great divide

This mountain’s high, too high for us
This mountain’s high, too high for us
This mountain’s high, too high for us
This mountain’s high, too high for us
Oh yeah
You know I'll make it

Your ways are high, too high for us
Your ways are too high, too high for us
Your ways are too high, too high for us
Your ways are too high, too high

Only you
only you
only you can pull me over it

Only you
only you
only you can pull me over it

Pull me, drag me, hold me, keep me, walk me while
you pull me over it
Take me, heal me, make me, break me, love me while
you pull me over it
Take me, heal me, make me, break me, love me while
you pull me over it"
