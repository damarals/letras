"1" "And The Wind Was Low
Love Song

And the wind was low
And He brought me to the water
I felt His hand and joy began
And there was meaning

And the sky was blue
And He gave me His assurance
I then began to understand
The blessed meaning
Oh Creator, your perfect wisdom

And the wind grew still
And he touched me with the power
Then came the fire, the strong desire
To really serve Him

And the tears were joy
And He listened as I sang to Him
I bowed my head, He gently said
I was forgiven

Oh Creator, your perfect promise"
