Lyrics by Mac Powell/Music by Third Day
From the recording: Come Together, Track #9.

Cannot find the words to say I'm sorry
Don't know how to show you I was wrong
Wasted all that you had given to me
Now I'm left with nothing and no one
And I find it's my fault
I'm the only one to blame
For the tears and the pain

I don't know what I can say
Or would it matter anyway
'Cause I don't know how you could still forgive me
For all that I have put you through
Is there anything that I can do
I would give my life to find your mercy

All my life has lead to this decision
To return and ask you this one thing
And if I had one chance or if a million
Would it ever be enough for me
To explain what I've done
Now I know that I was wrong
Will you hold me again

I don't know what I can say
Or would it matter anyway
'Cause I don't know how you could still forgive me
For all that I have put you through
Is there anything that I can do
I would give my life to find your mercy
What will it take until you forgive me
I don't know

And I find it's my fault
I'm the only one to blame
For the tears and the pain

I don't know what I can say
Or would it matter anyway
'Cause I don't know how you could still forgive me
For all that I have put you through
Is there anything that I can do
I would give my life to find your mercy
I don't know what I can say
Or would it matter anyway
'Cause I don't know how you could still forgive me
For all that I have put you through
Is there anything that I can do
I would give my life to find your mercy
What will it take until you forgive me
Oh Lord, will I find that you have already
