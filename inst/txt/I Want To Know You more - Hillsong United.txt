"1" "I Want To Know You (more)
Hillsong United

In the secret in the quite place
In the stillness you are there
In the secret in the quiet hour i wait only for you,
cause i want to know you more


I want to know you, I want to hear your voice,
I want to know you more
I want to touch you, I want to see your face
I want to know you more

I am reaching for the highest goal
That I might receive the prize
Pressing onward pushing every hindrance aside out of my way
Cause i want to know you more

I want to know you, I want to hear your voice,
I want to know you more
I want to touch you, I want to see your face
I want to know you more


I want to know you I want to hear your voice
I want to know you more
I want to touch you I want to see your face
I want to know you more


I want to know you, I want to hear your voice,
I want to know you more
I want to touch you, I want to see your face
I want to know you more"
