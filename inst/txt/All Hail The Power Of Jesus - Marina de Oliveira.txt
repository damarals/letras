\"How! Crown him Lord of all

All hail the power of Jesus name
Let angels prostrate fall,
Let angels prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal diadem

And crown him

Hail him who saves you by His grace
And crown him Lord of all
Well join the everlasting song
And crown him Lord of all

Were chosen generation here
Lets praise the allmighty God
And crown him Lord of all Glory
And crown him Lord of all Glory

Gloria\""
