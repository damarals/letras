"1" "To the Father's House
Comunidade Cat√≥lica Shalom

Come, let us rejoice singing to the Lord
Celebrating as we return to the Father's house
Come to the banquet of His great love
For the one who once was dead has come back to life

We adore you, Lord
All the honor, always
Be unto the Lamb, Conqueror
All nations will celebrate Your mercies
Singing glory to the Savior

Come, see the people so loved by God
Clothed in mercy and compassion, unending grace
A people redeemed by His Holy Cross
On the roads of the world altogether, singing a new song

We adore you, Lord
All the honor, always
Being to the land conqueror
All nations will celebrate Your mercy
Singing glory to the Savior

His mercy, His mercy
Endures forever
His mercy, His mercy
Endures forever
His mercy, His mercy
Endures forever
His mercy, His mercy
Endures forever

We adore you, Lord
All the honor, always
Be unto the Lamb, Conqueror
All nations will celebrate Your mercies
Singing glory to the Savior"
