Switchfoot

My words come out like an avalanche in silence
And you've got oceans strapped to your eyelids
They tell me that no man is an island
But it feels like it's a storm that I've been fighting

And I used to listen to the radio
But I've got an army of voices in my head
Voices in my head
And we used to live in stereo
But I've got an army of voices in my head
Voices in my head

How come the friends and the foes invisible
Are the ones that made my soul most miserable?
Head's reeling from the feeling
In my mind but I feel it in the physical
Why's the sunlight hiding?
Ain't letting any light in
It's the storm that I've been fighting

And I used to listen to the radio
But I've got an army of voices in my head
Voices in my head
And we used to live in stereo
But I've got an army of voices in my head
Voices in my head"
