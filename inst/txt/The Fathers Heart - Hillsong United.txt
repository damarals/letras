Hillsong United

(Verse 1:)
When the walls close in around me
Let your glory light the darkness of my night
When the suffering's all that I see
May I walk with you by faith and not by sight

(Verse 2:)
On the road of sweet surrender
I have nothing but to offer you my life
Greater love I have not found it
All by mercy You have eased this troubled mind

(Pre-chorus 1:)
Open hearted
I will search
And I will find

(Chorus:)
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oa
Sin is broken
The lost now chosen
The Father's Heart

(Verse 3:)
Humble King you go before me
By your grace I live for everything that's true
Through your son I am made wealthy
There's no other who will love me like you do

(Pre-chorus 2:)
And forever
I'll keep running
Back to you

(Bridge:)
You reign
You reign in all the earth
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oa"
