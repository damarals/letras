MercyMe

Come they told me
Pa rum pum pum pum
A newborn King to see
Pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the King
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
So to honor Him
Pa rum pum pum pum
When we come

Little Baby
Pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy too
Pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gift to bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
That's fit to give the King
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Shall I play for You?
Pa rum pum pum pum
On my drum

Shall I play for You?
Shall I play for You?
Mary looked at me and nodded
The ox and lamb kept time
I played my drum for Him
Oh I played my best for Christ"
