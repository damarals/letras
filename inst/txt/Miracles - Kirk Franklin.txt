Kirk Franklin

I've seen God do miracles today
I mean things that I can't explain
Like flooding me with grace
Standing before me
Blessing every step I take

I've seen God do miracles in me
Things that don't change easily
It was hard but You were
Patiently preparing me

I know there are some who doubt it
Life don't let them think about it
But us, we cannot live without it
He's everything I need
I've seen God do miracles

I've seen God do miracles today
They come in so many ways
Like the sunlight on my face
Or the debt of sin I
Could not pay that's been erased

I know there are some who doubt it
Life don't let them think about it
But us, we cannot live without it
He's everything I need

I've seen God do miracles today
I've seen God do miracles today

The next time life's winds and waves
Washes all your faith away
Know God can still do miracles today

(Kirk)
Everybody wants one
They would give money
and stand in line just to receive one
But while you're waiting on the miracle you want
Don't forget the miracle you are

(Chorus)
My Life is a miracle
Can't deny it, I'm a miracle
Oh the price for my miracle
Nails in his hands & his feet for me
To be free, that's a miracle
Can you believe it, I'm a miracle
I know waiting ain't easy for your miracle
Don't give up your seat, it's amazing

My whole life is a miracle
Can't deny it, I'm a miracle
Oh the price for my miracle
Nails in his hands & his feet for me
To be free, that's a miracle
Can you believe it, I'm a miracle
I know waiting ain't easy for your miracle
Don't give up your seat

The next time life's winds and waves
Washes all your faith away
Know God can still do miracles today"
