"1" "Hallelujah
Newsboys

walk into the sunlight so bright
illumination blocking out the night
she knows that the promises are airtight
there is no doubt; you can see it in her eyes

you'll hear her singing to heaven - even
without letting out a word to be heard
in every single situation (none too big - none too small)
she looks up and the world looks on

Chorus 1

she sings hallelujah
when all has become nothing
and her hope in the Saviour
has colored all she does
and taints the way she loves

she sings hallelujah
and falls to the ground again
with hands stretched up to the sky
she's waiting for the day
she'll hear the father say...

step into the spotlight - so bright
a character check in the dead of night
to cut the stays of reason, till death defy
all understanding in the neighbour's eye
to run the race like this day's the last celebrate
in all we do and all we say look up
'cause the world looks on

Chorus 1

Chorus 2

we sing hallelujah
when all has become nothing
and our hope in the Saviour
has colored all we do
let it be for You

we'll sing hallelujah
and fall to the ground again
with hands stretched up to the sky
we're waiting for the day
we'll hear the father say
yeah, we're gonna hear him say
\"well done, good and faithful one
enter in, come on, share with me
welcome home good and faithful one
on and on through eternityâ€¦\""
