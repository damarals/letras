Hillsong United

Grace that flows like a river
Washing over me
Fount of heaven, love of christ
Overflow in me

Thank you, Jesus
You set me free
Christ, my saviour
You rescued me

Take this life delivered
A vessel of your love
Wholly now devoted
To see your kingdom come

You've given me life
You've opened my eyes
I love you, lord
I love you, lord

You've entered my heart
You've set my apart
I love you, lord
I love you, lord"
