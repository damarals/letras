"1" "Lamb Of God
Gaither Vocal Band

Your only son
No sin to hide
But you have sent him
From your side
To walk upon this guilty sod
And to become the lamb of god

Your gift of love
They crucified
They laughed and scorned him as he died
The humble king
They named a fraud
And sacrificed the lamb of god

Chorus:
Oh lamb of god, sweet lamb of god
I love the holy lamb of god
Oh wash me in his precious blood
My jesus christ the lamb of god

I was so lost I should have died
But you have brought me to your side
To be led by your staff and rod
And to be call a lamb of god

((chorus))

Oh wash me in his precious blood
My jesus chris the lamb of god"
