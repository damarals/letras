"1" "My King, My Friend
Diante do Trono

I humbly draw near to your throne
Your mercy covers me
Restore me and make me whole
And all my sin forgives

A broken heart you will never deny
A broken heart you will never deny

My King, you are my friend
Youâ€™ll be with me until the end
My joy and peace
My help in times of need
My wounded heart
Was healed because you love me

You have chosen the humbled
The rejected, the me
You heal the sick,
Give strength to the weak"
