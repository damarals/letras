"1" "There Will Be A Day
Jeremy Camp

I try to hold on to this world
With everything I have
But I feel the weight of what it brings
And the hurt that tries to grab
The many trials that seem to never end
His word declares this truth
That we will enter in this rest with wonders anew

But I hold on to this hope
And the promise that he brings
That there will be a place with no more suffering

There will be a day with no more tears, no more pain
And no more fears
There will be a day when the burdens of this place
Will be no more, we'll see jesus face to face
But until that day, we'll hold on to you always

I know the journey seems so long
You feel you're walking on your own
But there has never been a step
Where you've walked out all alone

Troubled soul don't lose your heart
Cause joy and peace he brings
And the beauty that's in store
Outweighs the hurt of life's sting

(chorus)
I can't wait until that day
Where the very one I've lived for
Always will wipe away the sorrow
That I've faced
To touch the scars that rescued me
From a life of shame and misery
This is why
This is why I sing"
