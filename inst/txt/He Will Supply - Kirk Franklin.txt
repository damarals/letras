"1" "He Will Supply
Kirk Franklin

Though your vessel be empty
He will supply
For His yoke is easy
He will supply
He will supply
He will supply
Oh Jesus said that He will supply

Though your dreams feel like memories
He will supply
And some relationships are now ending
He will supply
He will supply
He will supply
Oh Jesus said that he will supply

So my friend don't you worry
He will supply
This is just temporary
He will supply

He will supply
He will supply

Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus
My Jesus
Sweet Jesus
Yes Jesus
Oh Jesus said that He will supply

Oh supply (6x)

He said He will (2x)
Supply
I know He will (2x)
Supply
He told me He will (2x)
Supply
He said He will (2x)
Supply"
