"1" "Here With You
Hillsong United

When sunlight breaks and day has just begun
In the still wait for you voice to lead me on

Eternity residing in my soul
I'll follow you til' the day you call me home

Here now with you
I have heaven in me
Everything's changed
And I will never be without you

From the dust I'm made with your calling on my life
And your plan weaved into the fabric of my heart

Eternity residing in my soul
I lift my eyes to the one who gave it all
I lift my eyes to the one who gave it all

Here now with you
I have heaven in me
Everything's changed
And I will never be without you
Always with you trough your spirit in me
Everything's changed
And I will never be without you, without you

You see me in the fire
Reaching out with open hands
You find me on my knees
And fill me with your peace again
Forever I am loved
Your freedom reings in me
Forever you are lord me everything"
