Yesterday
I heard Your voice
Whispering through
All the noise
I pretended
I couldn't hear You
But You kept
On pursuing me
And You began
To move in me
And I just
Couldn't hide any more
I won't fight You

Go ahead
Take what You want to
Take what You need to
Don't let me hold You back
Go ahead
Do what You have to
Cuz I want to know You
Don't let me hold You back

I'll my wear heart
Out on my sleeve
If it brings You close to me
Help me leave the life
I knew before You
Come inside, erase the shame
Call me by different name
I won't be the same anymore
God, I trust You

God, I was so wrong
To stay away so long
Oh, how I need You"
