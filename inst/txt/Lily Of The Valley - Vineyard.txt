Vineyard

Lily of the valley
Bright and morning star
Fairest of ten thousand
You are

How can I perceive Your beauty?
I long to see Your face
Jesus

Holy lamb of heaven
Perfect son of man
Acquainted with our suffering
Broken for us all

How can I perceive Your mercy?
Help me find Your grace
Jesus

Desire of the nations
The risen coming King
Holding the sceptre of justice
You reign You reign

How can I perceive Your coming?
May You find faith on the earth
Jesus

More of You and less of me
Jesus"
