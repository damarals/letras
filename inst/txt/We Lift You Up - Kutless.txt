"1" "We Lift You Up
Kutless

Come all you heavy hearted
Come all you weary ones
Hear what the grace of god has done
Come cast your cares upon him
Come lay your burdens down
Here in the place where peace is found

We lift you up, we lift you up
For your great love
We lift you up, we lift you up
For your great love

We were the heavy hearted, we were the weary ones
Until the grace of god's own son
We cast our cares upon you
We lay our burdens down
Here in the place where peace is found

We lift you up, we lift you up
For your great love
We lift you up, we lift you up
For your great love

Every knee will bow before your throne
Every tongue will confess that you are lord
Every knee will bow before your throne
Every tongue will confess that you are lord

We lift you up, we lift you up
For your great love
We lift you up, we lift you up
For your great love"
