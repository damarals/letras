"1" "Brand New Song
Love Song

Sing unto the heavens with a brand new song
The one that we've been hearing's been a hit too long
The lyrics sound confused as if they don't belong
So sing unto the Lord and sing with feeling

And sing a song of love
And sing a song of gladness
Much too long our music
Has been filled, filled with sadness

Sing unto the heavens with a brand new song
Sing unto the Lamb with voices clear and strong
Tell a world that's waited now for much too long
All the truths that God has been revealing

And sing a song of praise
And sing a song of gladness
Much too long our music
Has been filled, filled with sadness.(Sadness)

Ahhh-ah-ah ah ah ah...ah ...ah....ah"
