"1" "Love So Holy
Kari Jobe

God of all existence, Sovereign with no end
An architect of wonder, from dust You made a man
Speaking light from nothing, the universe aglow
Shining just to show me

You love me, You love me, You love me
This I know, this I know
You love me, You love me, You love me
This I know, this I know

Eyes as wild as fire, hair as white as wool
A voice with strength like thunder
You reign in humble rule
You left Your crown for suffering, for death upon a cross
You gave Your life to tell me

I've never known a love so holy
I've never known a heart so kind
I just want to bring You worship, I just want to yield my life
I don't want to miss one moment
I don't want to turn away
I just want to bring You reverence
I just want to love You the same

This I know"
