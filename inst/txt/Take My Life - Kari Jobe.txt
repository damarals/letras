"1" "Take My Life
Kari Jobe

Take my life and let it be consecrated Lord to Thee
Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of Thy love
At the impulse of Thy love

Take my feet and let them be swift and beautiful for Thee
Take my voice and let me sing always only for my King
Always only for my King

Take my silver and my gold not a mite would I withhold
Take my moments and my days let them flow in ceaseless praise
Let them flow in ceaseless praise

Take my will it is Thine own it shall be Thy royal throne
Take my heart it is Thine own it shall be Thy royal throne
It shall be Thy royal throne

Take my life and let it be consecrated Lord to Thee
Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of Thy love
At the impulse of Thy love"
