Verse 1:
When I come into His presence
I humble myself,
lift up both my hands,
and I begin to worship Him, I worship Him.

Chorus:
For all He's done for me,
redeemed and set me free,
and because, just because He's God.

Verse 2:
When I come into His presence,
I humble myself,
remembering what He's done,
the victories He's won,
so I'll praise Him, I'll praise Him.
