"1" "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God
Vineyard

A mighty fortress is our God.
A bulwark never failing
Our helper, He, amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing
for still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe
His craft and power are great
And armed with cruel hate
On earth is not His equal

And though this world with devils filled
Should threaten to undo us
We will not fear for God has willed
His truth to triumph through us
The prince of darkness grim
We tremble not for him
His rage we can endure
For lo, his doom is sure
One little word shall fell Him

That word above all earthly powers
No thanks to them abideth
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through Him who with us sideth
Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also
The body they may kill
God's truth abideth still
His kingdom is forever!"
