"1" "For All You've Done
Hillsong United

My savior, redeemer lift me from the miry clay
Almighty, forever, I'll never be the same
'Cause you came near from the everlasting
to the world we live
The Father's only Son.

For you lived and you died and you rose again on high
And you opened the way for the world to live again
Hallelujah, for all you've done."
