Praise Him you heavens
And all thatâ€™s above
Praise Him you angels
And heavenly hosts
Let the whole earth praise Him

Praise Him the sun moon
And bright shining stars
Praise Him you heavens
And waters and skies
Let the whole earth praise Him

Great in power
Great in glory
Great in mercy
King of heaven
Great in battle
Great in wonder
Great in Zion
King over all the earth"
