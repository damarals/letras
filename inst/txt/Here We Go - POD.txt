P.O.D.

And he never knew the meaning of love until he'd seen her.
Ah man she really drives him crazy,
and she knows what she's doing
Heart aches, He can't fight this feeling,
And won't stop until he tells her
She is his one and only lady, and you got to believe me.

Is what he said, what he said.
And this is what he said.

If you take my hand, and we can run away.
Stay close to my love, cause here we go again.
Don't let go of my hand, so we can fly away.
If you trust in my love, this will never end.

She never did believe in love until she'd seen him.
He's got to be pretty amazing, for her to share what she's feeling.
She takes the chance, time for living, if she wants to get with him.
She said \"Your gonna think I'm crazy,
but you got to believe me\"

Is what she said, what she said.
And this is what she said.

If you take my hand, and we can run away.
Stay close to my love, cause here we go again
Don't let go of my hand, so we can fly away.
If you trust in my love, then this will never end.

Seems like we spend so much time driving this to it's knees.
I guess I won't really mind,
if we're living for you and me.

And this is what we said.

If you take my hand, and we can run away.
Stay close to my love, cause here we go again.
Don't let go of my hand, so we can fly away.
If you trust in my love, this will never end.

If you take my hand, and we can run away.
Stay close to my love, cause here we go again.
Don't let go of my hand, so we can fly away.
If you trust in my love, then this will never end."
