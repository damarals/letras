"1" "Broken Together
Casting Crowns

What do you think about when you look at me
I know we're not the fairy tale
You dreamed we'd be
You wore the veil, you walked the aisle
You took my hand
And we dove into a mystery

How I wish we could go back to simpler times
Before all our scars
And all our secrets were in the light
Now on this hallowed ground
We've drawn the battle line
Will we make it through the night?

It's gonna take much more
Than promises this time
Only god can change our minds

Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete
Could we just be broken together
If you can bring your shattered dreams
And I'll bring mine
Could healing still be spoken and save us
The only way we'll last forever
Is broken together

How it must have been so lonely by myself
We were building kingdoms
And chasing dreams and left love behind
I'm praying god will help our broken hearts alive
And we won't give up the fight

It's gonna take much more
Than promises this time
Only god can change our minds

Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete
Could we just be broken together
If you can bring your shattered dreams
And I'll bring mine
Could healing still be spoken and save us
The only way we'll last forever
Is broken together

Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete
Could we just be broken together
If you can bring your shattered dreams
And I'll bring mine
Could healing still be spoken and save us
The only way we'll last forever
Is broken together"
