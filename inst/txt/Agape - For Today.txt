For Today

Can we payback more than can be measured?
If we could love[6x]

There is an amount of love
An amount of grace
Beyond all meaning
Beyond all measure
If we could even grasp it
There would be more pleasure
There is no greater love than
laying your life down for a friend
If we loved God to a teaspoon
of his overflowing cup

What would this world then see?[2x]
Our land of sorrow and turmoil
would swirl to a community of joy
Open our eyes to glisten
Open our hearts to receive
Open our mouths to smile
This is a love that none can fathom

How can we repay[2x]

Love the Lord your God
With all your heart
All your soul
All your mind
All your strength
