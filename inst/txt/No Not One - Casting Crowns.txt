Casting Crowns

No better word than from your lips
No perfect life than what you lived
No greater gift, no not one

No brighter star has ever shined
No better hope for all mankind
No higher mind, no not one

And no one has ever known this kind of love
You've shown

There has never been a greater love than your son
No not one
And there will never be a name above, no not one
With his life you have forgiven us
Hope has come, hope has come
And there will never be a greater love, no not one

No image true or sweeter frame
No simple word can match your name
No greater fame, no not one
And no one has ever seen the depth of your majesty

There has never been a greater love than your son
No not one
And there will never be a name above, no not one
And with his life you have forgiven us
Hope has come, hope has come

And there will never be a greater love, no not one
No greater call, you gave us all a reason to live
No greater love, you gave us all a reason to give
No greater life, you gave us all a reason to shine

No greater love, forever mine
There has never been a greater love than your son
No not one
And there will never be a name above, no not one
There has never been a greater love than your son
No not one

And there will never be a name above, no not one
And with his life you have forgiven us, hope has come
Hope has come
And there will never be a greater love, no not one
No, no, no not one"
