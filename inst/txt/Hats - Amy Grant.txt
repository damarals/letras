The sun comes up
The breakfast show
Can't you see me running
It's crazy don't you know?
(Don't you know? Don't you know?)

The moon is high
I'm working through the night
Will somebody tell me
Where do all the hours go?
(I don't know.)

Well it don't stop
No, it's never gonna stop
Why do I have to wear so many things on my head?
HATS!

One day I'm a mother
One day I'm a lover
What am I supposed to do?
HATS!
Working for a livin'
(Working for a livin')
All because I'm driven
(All because I'm driven)
To be the very best for you.

The water is hot
(So hot)
The phone don't stop
(Hello, good-bye)
So how do I manage
To hold on to my sanity
(I don't know, baby, I don't know)

The red dress on
Time for having fun
(Time for having fun)
But can I really be
The girl you see in me?

The spirit is willing
But the flesh is weak
Why do I have to wear so many things on my head?
HATS!

One day I'm a mother
(One day I'm a mother)
One day I'm a lover
(One day I'm a lover)
What am I supposed to do?
HATS!
Working for a livin'
(Working for a livin')
All because I'm driven
(All because I'm driven)
To be the very best for you.

HATS!
One day I'm a mother
(One day I'm a mother)
One day I'm a lover
(One day I'm a lover)
What am I supposed to do?
HATS!
Working for a livin'
All because I'm driven
To be the very best for you.

This may be a dream come true
This may be poetry in motion
This may be a dream come true
But when it all come down
It's an awful lot to do.

HATS!
It don't stop
Why do I have to wear thing on my head?
HATS!

One day I'm a mother
(One day I'm a mother)
One day I'm a lover
(One day I'm a lover)
What am I supposed to do?
HATS!
Working for a livin'
(Working for a livin')
All because I'm driven
(All because I'm driven)
To be the very best for you.
HATS!

One day I'm a mother
(One day I'm a mother)
One day I'm a lover
(One day I'm a lover)
What am I supposed to do?
HATS!
Working for a livin'
All because I'm driven
To be the very best,
Very best (Nah, Nah, Nah).

HATS!
What am I supposed to do?
HATS!
Working for a livin'
(Working for a livin')
All because I'm driven
(All because I'm driven)
To be the very best

It don't stop
No, it's never gonna stop
Why do I have to wear
Why to I have to wear
HATS!

One day I'm a mother
One day I'm a lover
What am I supposed to do?
HATS!
Working for a livin'
All because I'm driven
To be the very best for you.
