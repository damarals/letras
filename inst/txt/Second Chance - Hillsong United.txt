"1" "Second Chance
Hillsong United

You called my name
Reached out Your hand
Restored my life
And I was redeemed
The moment you entered my life

Amazing grace
Christ gave that day
My life was changed
When from my shoulders
Fell the weight of my sin

So it's with everything I am
I reach out for Your hand
The hope that changed the second chance I’ve gained
On You I throw my life
Casting all my fears aside
How could greater love than this
Ever possibly exist?

Consume my thoughts
As I rest in You
I’m now in love
With the Savior
Carrying the marks of His love

So I wait upon You now
With my hands released to You
Where a little faith is enough
To see mountains lift and move
And I wait upon You now
Dedicated to Your will
To this love that will remain
A love that never fails"
