"1" "When I Speak Your Name
Diante do Trono

Jesus, the most beautiful name of all names
Jesus, the only name that brings healing and strength
When I speak Your Name, mountains move, chains are loosed
When I speak Your Name, darkness flees, it has no hold on me

Jesus, the most beautiful name that I know
You're the exalted One
Jesus, You have the power alone
You lift the lonely one, Jesus

Jesus, the most wonderful name of all names
Jesus, the only name that brings freedom and hope
When I speak Your Name, mountains move, chains are loosed
When I speak Your Name, darkness flees, it has no hold on me

Jesus, the most beautiful name that I know
You're the exalted One
Jesus, You have the power alone
You lift the lonely one
You lift the lonely one, Jesus

Be exalted, be exalted, be exalted higher and higher
Be exalted, be exalted, be exalted higher and higher
Be exalted, be exalted, be exalted higher and higher
Be exalted, be exalted, be exalted higher and higher"
