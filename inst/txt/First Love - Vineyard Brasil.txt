Vineyard Brasil

Be my first love
Be my first love
Light a way for my feet
And wash me in your words of life

Be my first love
Be my first love
Fill my heart with desire
For holy fire to burn within

Holy spirit give me a passion
For the son of God
Holy spirit give me a passion
For the son of God

My heart cries
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus lord
My heart cries
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, lord of my life"
