"1" "Ten Hours
Warren Barfield

There's ten hours between us tonight
And I feel like my heart will break
' Cause it's been way too long
Since I've last seen your face
What I'd give if you were here with me now
And I was lost in your touch
If I know my heart
There's nothing I've ever wanted so much
But to love you
Just to love you
It's all I wanna do
There's ten hours between us tonight
And I feel like I could die
But all the pain would just
Go away if I could look in your eyes

And love you
Just love you
It's all I wanna do
\" Cause I know you're the one
That I've been praying for
I could love you for a thousand years
And wish for a thousand more
There's ten hours between us tonight
But tonight can only last so long
By twelve o'clock tomorrow baby
You'll be here in my arms
And I'll hold you close to my heart
And I pray you feel my love
Until that day when time or space
Will never again separate us
And I'll love you
Oh, I'll love you
It's all I ever do
' Cause I know you're the one
It just feels so right
Would it be ok with you
If I loved you for the rest of my life"
