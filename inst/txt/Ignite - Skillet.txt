It's past time, it's past time
I take control, I'm cutting, cutting wires
Fight or flight, dynamite
With just a spark, I come, I come alight
I don't wanna live in fear, no
I won't waste another year, oh
It's past time, the last time
Never go back and cross the, cross the line

I defy it, I deny it, striking, lighting

I ignite all of the I pain take
'Cause I refuse to break, woah
Get back when I ignite
Forsaking not for me
I know what I believe, woah
Get back when I ignite
Setting the world on fire
Sitting and burning brightеr
Setting the world on fire
Gеt back when I ignite
All of the pain I take
'Cause I refuse to break, woah
Get back when I ignite

Ignite
Ignite
Ignite

A hostage, exhausted
I'm riding on a razor, razor's edge
The countdown begins now
This fire inside is burning, burning out
I don't wanna live in fear, no
Detonating, stand clear, oh

I defy it, I deny it, striking, lighting

I ignite all of the I pain take
'Cause I refuse to break, woah
Get back when I ignite
Forsaking not for me
I know what I believe, woah
Get back when I ignite
Setting the world on fire
Sitting and burning brighter
Setting the world on fire
Get back when I ignite
All of the pain I take
'Cause I refuse to break, woah
Get back when I ignite

Detonating, stand clear
Detonating, stand clear

I ignite all of the I pain take
'Cause I refuse to break, woah
Get back when I ignite
Forsaking not for me
I know what I believe, woah
Get back when I ignite
Setting the world on fire
Sitting and burning brighter
Setting the world on fire
Get back when I ignite
All of the pain I take
'Cause I refuse to break, woah
Get back when I ignite

Ignite
Ignite
Ignite
Get back when I ignite"
