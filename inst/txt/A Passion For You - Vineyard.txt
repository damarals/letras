"1" "A Passion For You
Vineyard

Give me a passion for you, Lord
Come light the fire of my heart
Oh may I burn with your holy love
Come let your Spirit impart
Passion for you

A passion for you
Come break my heart
A passion for you

Give me a heart for all you do
Don't let me turn away
Give me your eyes that I may see
Children the way that you do
Passion for you

A passion for you
Come break my heart
I give it to you
I open the door
For you to do more
I need passion for you"
