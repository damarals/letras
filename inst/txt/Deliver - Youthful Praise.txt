Verse
I know a man who understands
All of the problems that we've come against
He holds in His hands all of the powere
It will take to deliver us from all of them

He is the word of God
Wrapped Himself in flesh like ours
Healed the sick, saved the lost
Gave His life upon a cross

Chorus
His name is Jesus, Christ the Lord
The omnipotent Son of God
And He's able to deliver us from harm

Bridge
He delivered Daniel from the lion
And the Hebrew boys from the fire
Delivered Lazarus from the grave
So I know He can handle my cares

Chorus

Vamp
(tenors)
He'll deliver, He'll deliver
He'll deliver, He'll deliver, I know

(altos)
I know He will, He can do it
Yes I know He will, Jesus can do it

(sopranos)
I know He can do it
Yes I know that He's able to do it

Deliver, deliver"
