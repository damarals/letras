"1" "What A Great Love
Alessandra Samadello

In the quiet hour of the morning
I get up and think about you
What a great love, what a great love
My imagination goes to heaven
Where your presence I can see
What a great love, what a great love

You are my God
You are the only one to be praised
You are my God
Holy, holy, is your name
You are my God
You are the only one to be praised
You are my God
Holy, holy, is your name

When I see your beauty and splendor
I desire holiness
Cause you are holy, you are holy
I will never, never leave your presence
My heart is full of you
Cause you are holy, you are holy

You are my God
You are the only one to be praised
You are my God
Holy, holy, is your name
You are my God
You are the only one to be praised
You are my God
Holy, holy, is your name."
