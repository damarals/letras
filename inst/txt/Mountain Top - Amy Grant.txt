"1" "Mountain Top
Amy Grant

I love to sing and I love to pray,
Worship the Lord most every day.
I go to the temple, and I just want to stay
To hide from the hustle of the world and its ways.

And I'd
Love to live on a mountain top,
Fellowshipping with the Lord.
I'd love to stand on a mountain top,
'Cause I love to feel my spirit
Soar....

But I've got to come down
>From the mountain top
To the people in the valley below;
They'll never know
That they can go
To the mountain of the Lord.

Now praising the Father is a good thing to do,
To worship the Trinity in spirit and truth.
But if we worshipped all of the time,
Well, there would be no one to lead the blind.

But I'd
Love to live on a mountain top,
Just fellowshipping with the Lord.
And I'd love to stand on a mountain top,
'Cause I love to feel my spirit
Soar.... (Soar....)

But I've got to come down
>From the mountain top
To the people in the valley below;
They'll never know
That they can go
To the mountain of the Lord.

I am not saying that worship is wrong,
But worship is more than just singin' some songs,
'Cause it's all that we say and everything that we do;
It's letting God's Spirit live through you.

Still, I'd
Love to live on a mountain top
Fellowshipping with the Lord.
I'd love to stand on a mountain top,
'Cause I love to feel my spirit
Soar.... (Soar....)
