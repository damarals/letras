"1" "With Us
Hillsong United

Before the world
You knew the plans for me
Before my heart believed
You came to my rescue

And now I'm found in love
There's no other else to run
You keep my life within Your mighty hand
Oh God

There's no end to Your love
There's no end to Your love
You're with us
You're with us

There's nothing in this world
That could take You away
You're with us
You're with us

Before I call
I know You'll answer me
You'll make a way
Beyond what I could imagine

What could separate
From the love You give
I put hope in everything
That You are
Oh God
You reign in our hearts
You reign above all
Be lifted on high"
