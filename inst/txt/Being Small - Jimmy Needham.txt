"1" "Being Small
Jimmy Needham

Yeah yeah yes, oh
Why i wanna be a hurr-i-cane
When i’m barely a breeze?
Cause i’ve already seen Your strom
Bring me down to my knees
Just when we think we made it high enough
You knock us back to the ground
We’re all trying to move up fast
Can’t see the contrast
To how King came down

Cause i can’t build my towers higher
And live inside Your fire
No no no no no

Chorus
Whenever i climb too high
Keep my feet on the ground
And when i get full of me
Turn me upside down
You know pride and not just summer
Come before the fall
So if it’s You that’s getting bigger
i don’t mind
Being small
Being small

Maybe if i shout real loud
Maybe than i’ll draw a crowd
And they’ll finally cheer
Or maybe i should tone down
Never make a sound now
Anything to draw them near
Or maybe there’s more to life
Than trying to make a name
Even though they say it ain’t so
So maybe i should step on down
Hand off the King’s crown
To the guy on the phone

Cause i can’t build my towers higher
And live inside Your fire
No no no no oh no

Chorus
Whenever i climb too high
Keep my feet on the ground
And if i get full of me
Turn me upside down
You know pride and not just summer
Come before the fall
So if it’s You that’s getting bigger
i don’t mind
Being small

These people won’t miss me
i’ll be out of their memories
The ground will forget me for sure
Only One is remembered
One Name to be treasured
Is Yours

Chorus
So now when i climb too high
Keep my feet on the ground
And if i get full of me
Turn me upside down
You know pride and not just summer
Come before the fall

Oh oh oh, so maybe hopefully
I’ll see less of me, more of You
And it’s true, i’ll be finally free yeah
That’s what i want after all, yeah

Chorus
Whenever i climb too high
Keep my feet on the ground
And when i get full of me
Turn me upside down
You know pride and not just summer
Come before the fall
So if it’s You that’s getting bigger
I don’t mind
Being small
Being small
Being small
Being small oh, yeah
Being small, oh"
