Michael W. Smith

I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the one who gave it all
I'll stand my soul, Lord, to you surrender
All I am is yours

I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the one who gave it all
I'll stand my soul, Lord, to you surrendered
All I am is yours

I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the one who gave it all
I'll stand my soul, Lord, to you surrendered
All I am is yours

I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the one who gave it all
I'll stand my soul, Lord, to you surrendered
All I am is yours

I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the one who gave it all
I'll stand my soul, Lord, to you surrendered
All I am is yours

I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the one who gave it all
I'll stand my soul, Lord, to you surrendered
All I am is yours"
