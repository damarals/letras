"1" "Beautiful To Me
Vineyard

You're beautiful, so beautiful,
Lord You are my bright and morning star.
You're beautiful, so beautiful,
Oh shining light I lift your name up on high.

Lord You're beautiful to me, and Your
Kingdom is all I wanna see. (repeat)

You're powerful, so powerful,
Risen Lord exalted evermore.
You're powerful, so powerful, exalted King,
I lift my voice and sing.

Lord You're powerful to me and Your
Kingdom is all I wanna see. (repeat)

You're glorious, so glorious,
Holy one, the only perfect Son.
Glorious, You're glorious,
Your Kingdom reign will never ever end.

Lord You're glorious to me, and Your praises
Are all I wanna sing. (repeat)"
