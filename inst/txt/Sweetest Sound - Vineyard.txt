Vineyard

There's never been a love like this before
When Heaven calls
There's a hope that's here to free us all
There's never been such pure affection
The day You called
Then I knew I was worth fighting for
When Heaven calls you by name...

It's the sweetest sound
The sweetest sound
This love we've found
Has the sweetest sound

Now I can rest here in Your open arms
Your love came down
And You washed away my brokenness
When Heaven calls you by name...

What a chance we have been given
Even though we don't deserve a thing
Let's fix our eyes on the road to Heaven
For when You call..."
