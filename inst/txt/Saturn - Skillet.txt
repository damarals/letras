I ask him
When will I
Be free he
Said I am Asking him
When will I Change he said
No matter now No matter now

Saturn has a ring around it
You can never see it with your eyes
Saturn has a ring around it
Many moons know this to be true

You ask him
How can you
Be real he
Said you'll be
Knowing him
How you do
Now he says
Rest in this
Rest in this

Saturn has a ring around it
You can never see it with your eyes
Saturn has a ring around it
Many moons know this to be true
Heaven has a ring around it
The angels sing a song over you
Heaven has a ring around you
If you don't see it know that it's true
