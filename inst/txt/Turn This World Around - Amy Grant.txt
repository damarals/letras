"1" "Turn This World Around
Amy Grant

We are all the same it seems
Behind the eyes
Broken promises and dreams
Our good disguise

All we're really looking for is some place
Safe and warm
The shelter of each other in the storm
Maybe one day
We can turn and face our fears
Maybe one day
We can reach out through the tears
After all it's really not that far
To where hope can be found
Maybe one day
We can turn this world around

Who can trace the path of time
Not you or me
The twisting road we call our lives
We cannot see
The hunger and the longing everyone of us
Knows inside
Could be the bridge between us if we try
(Chorus)

Maybe one day
We can turn and face our fears
Maybe one day
We can reach out through the tears
