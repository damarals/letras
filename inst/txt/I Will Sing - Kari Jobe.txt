"1" "I Will Sing
Kari Jobe

I need to see You here, I need to know You're in control
Though my heart is torn wide open I will trust
I will remember

I need to hear Your voice speaking to silence all my doubts
Your word won't return empty
You will break through ev'ry darkness

Even when my breath is weak I will sing, I will sing
Even in my suffering
I will sing, I will sing

I need to see Your hope rising above my greatest fears
Even death has been defeated, I will trust, I will remember

Even when the shadows fall I will sing, I will sing
Even when the night is long I will sing, I will sing

Hallelujah, I surrender all to You
Hallelujah, You are God
you won't be shaken

I need to see You here, I need to know You're in control
Though my heart is torn wide open
I will trust, I will remember"
