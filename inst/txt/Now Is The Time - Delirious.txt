"1" "Now Is The Time
Delirious

The Winds are blowing through again
So we must follow
People daring to believe
We can change tomorrow
Be the miracle of Light
And we won't give up the fight

Now is the Time for us to shine
Shine with the face of Christ divine
No Compromise
For all heaven cries
Now is the time

The rivers running through again
Rejuvenating
For everything you touch you change
And we've all been changing
We're a city shinning on a hill
Tell this world your shinning still
Tell the world you always will

Now is the Time for us to shine
Shine with the face of Christ divine
No Compromise
For all heaven cries
Now is the time

Jesus, Jesus Precious Jesus
King of Light
Jesus, Jesus
Raise a torch that's shinning bright

I want to follow but what does it mean?
To live in this world and keep everything clean
Nothing i own here is every my own
When i live in the mercy and blessing you've shown
I lay down my life, see the world through your eyes
And fight for the hungry who pay for our lives
I want to help you in all of you will
So Jesus consume me, fill through me
Because now is the time

Now is the Time for us to shine
Shine with the face of Christ divine
No Compromise
For all heaven cries
Now is the time"
