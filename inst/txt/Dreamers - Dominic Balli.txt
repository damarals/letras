Dominic Balli

I met her in the fall but her name was spring
A mud hut no fluff in reality
South of the border south of the corridor
That leads to the unknown
We saw one shooting star
I closed my eyes and I prayed to god
When I asked what her wish was
She couldn't find one
It's a world she's never known
But somewhere we all deserve to go

It's our time
We are we are the dreamers
You could touch the sky
Calling all who are believers
Impossible is possible
Imagination drops the wall
There's an endless world outside
We are we are the dreamers

Why dream she said
What do you know
I define my life by the status quo
Here wishing and wonder
Are hidden by hunger
And the will just to survive
I know, well no I don't
But maybe I could show you the ropes
The mind is weapon wanting and waiting
For a place to let it go
You're free to fly and free to fall

Calling all our future is waiting
Geronimo step on the air
Tomorrow it is what we make it
Leave it or change it now
Ok"
