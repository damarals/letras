"1" "The Kingdom Is In Place - Let It Come!
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

Jehovah, you always have been
And always you will be
You've given the throne to your Son
He rules by your decree
The Kingdom has been brought to birth
His rulership will fill the earth

For now have come to pass
Salvation and kingdom and might
The Kingdom is in place
We pray: Let it come, Let it come!

The time for the Devil is short
We know what this will mean
Though living in times of distress
We see the things unseen
The Kingdom has been brought to birth
His rulership will fill the earth

For now have come to pass
Salvation and kingdom and might
The Kingdom is in place
We pray: Let it come, Let it come!

The angels in heaven rejoice
And sing with joyful cries
The heavens above are relieved
Of Satan and his lies
The Kingdom has been brought to birth
His rulership will fill the earth

For now have come to pass
Salvation and kingdom and might
The Kingdom is in place
We pray: Let it come, Let it come!"
