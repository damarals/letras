"1" "I Have Returned
Gaither Vocal Band

I have returned to the God of my childhood,
To the same simple faith as a child I once knew;
Like the prodigal son I have longed for my loved ones,
For the comforts of home and the God I outgrew.

I have returned to the God of my childhood,
Bethlehem's Babe, the prophet's Messiah;
He's Jesus to me, Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, I have returned.

I have returned to the God of my mother,
With unfailing faith for the child of her heart;
She said bring them up the way that you want them,
Thank God when they're grown, they'll never depart.

I have returned to the God of my mother,
I learned at her knee He's the lily of the valley;
He's Jesus to me, Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, I have returned.

I have returned to the God of my father,
The most God-like man a child could know;
I just heard a shout from the angels in glory,
Praising the Lord a child has come home.

I have returned to the God of my father,
Creator of heaven and earth, God of the universe;
He's Jesus to me, Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, I have returned.

I have returned to the Yahweh of Judah,
On my knees I did fall where the wall now stands;
This lesson I learned as I've worked my way homeward,
The Saviour of all is a comfort to man.

I have returned to the Father of Abraham,
The shepherd of Moses who called Him the great I am;
He's Jesus to me, Eternal Deity;
Praise His name, I have returned."
