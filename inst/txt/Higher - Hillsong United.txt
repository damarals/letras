For unto us a Saviour came
Amazing grace that takes the weight

His name is hope for all the earth
His name now and beyond this life
God with us

And You shall be called Almighty God
And we shall declare

Your name is higher, higher
Jesus Christ Your name is glorious
Your name is greater, sweeter
In all the earth, higher, higher

Now unto me, the Christ revealed
For you so loved and love me still

So great and greatly to be praised are You
So great and greatly to be praised

I owe you my life
I will worship You Forever
I owe You my life
I will live to bring You praises"
