MercyMe

If you had a dime for every time it rained
On this parade you’re marching in called life

You’d start to wonder if someone out there’s got your number
Well, hold your head up, breathe in deep, remember

Chorus
Ooh ooh you know it’s gonna be alright
Ooh ooh you know it’s gonna be alright

We’re gonna have those days when it all comes crashing in
Wondering if the sun will ever shine

Before you go and convince yourself you cannot make it
Hold your head up, breathe in deep, remember

Chorus
Ooh ooh you know it’s gonna be alright
Ooh ooh you know it’s gonna be alright
There’s a love much stronger than everything that holds you down right now
Sayin’ Ooh ooh you know it’s gonna be alright

So next time when you tell yourself this isn’t worth it
Hold your head up, breathe in deep, remember

Chorus

[Tag]
Count it pure joy when the world comes crashin’
Hold your head up and keep on dancin’"
