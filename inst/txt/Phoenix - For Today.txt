For Today

Now is the time for those who have died to rise and lift the sound of our voices high Kingdom come, Kingdom come!

There is a fire in the atmosphere
Can you feel it? You have been called to relinquish fear
Can you hear it? You were made to stand before the throne
Can you see it? Tell me, where are the ones with the heart for warfare
The ones that died to say : This is the price you pay ?
Step up! There is no glory without death
Step up, who will answer the call? Death is glory

I will rise from the ashes of my own death to abundant life under the cross
And I will not be turned back
But I will come with an army for He will raise up a generation to seek His face

Now is the time for those who have died to rise and lift the sound of our voices high; Kingdom come, Kingdom come!"
