"1" "High Praise
Youthful Praise

Let’s lift the high praise
To the lord

We all want the spirit of the lord to come in
But we must worship to invite him in
So enter his gates with thanksgiving and praise
With hands lifted up and your voices raised

Hallelujah, he’s worthy
Let’s give him the highest praise
Hallelujah, he’s worthy
Let’s lift up a high praise
To the lord (repeat)

We praise your name
We praise… your name

Halle…lujah"
