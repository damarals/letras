Vineyard

Calling everyone on earth
A new day has dawned on us
God has died with all our sins
But He's risen from the dead

New day brand new creation
New life new life this is salvation
Your death Your life Your resurrection
Has made a way for us to see the new day

All who choose to die with Him
Daily taking up the cross
Will be raised to life again
This is what our God has done

The old has gone the new has come
There is hope for everyone for everyone"
