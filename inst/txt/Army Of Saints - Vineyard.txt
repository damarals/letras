Vineyard

O Lord, we rejoice in Your love
Lead us on to Your high and holy place
In the heavens above

O Lord, we give praise to Your name
We will sing of Your great deliverance
In the army of saints

You are the Father, You are the life
We are Your people, the children of light
Blessed forever, Savior and King
Of Your great love we will sing"
