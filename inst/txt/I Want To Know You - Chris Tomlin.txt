"1" "I Want To Know You
Chris Tomlin

In the secret, in my quiet place
In the stillness you are there.
In the secret in my quiet hour,
Only for you.
Cause I want to know you more.

I want to know you
I want to hear your voice.
I want to know you more.
I want to touch you.
I want to see your face
I want to know you more.

I am reaching for the highest goal
And I might reseed the grass.
Nowhere pushing every anger to side,
Out of my way,
Cause I want to know you more.

I want to know you
I want to hear your voice.
I want to know you more.
I want to touch you.
I want to see your face
I want to know you more.

I want to know you
I want to hear your voice.
I want to know you more.
I want to touch you.
I want to see your face
I want to know you more.

In the secret, in my quiet place
In the stillness you are there."
