"1" "On The Lord's Day
Hillsong United

Make a way for the love of God
Let the world know
That he is near

Valleys rise and
Mountains will be moved
As our praise rises up to you

I will pray, I will pray

Let your kingdom come
Pray your will be done
Nations will see your fame
On the lord´s day

I will pray, I will pray"
