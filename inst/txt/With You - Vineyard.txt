"1" "With You
Vineyard

So pure, so right
This love I feel inside

So good just to be with You
No shame to hide

You put my fears to flight
I know that I am safe when I’m with You

So warm inside
You open up so wide

You let me walk right into You
No dark, just light

Your love is undisguised
I know where I belong when I’m with You

This is who I’m meant to be
I know You have chosen me

I can never turn away from this truth
Let the storms rage on outside

Let the day fade into night
There is nothing else that I would rather do

Jesus, I was born to spend this life with You
Jesus, I was born to spend this life with You

Jesus, I was born to spend this life with You"
