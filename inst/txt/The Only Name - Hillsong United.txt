"1" "The Only Name
Hillsong United

Your name is higher and exalted
far above everything that has name
Your name's the only name Jesus
by which all men can be saved

Your name is a strong tower
I run to you when I'm safe
my greatest on the Lord is to speak Your name

Jesus, My Lord Jesus Emannuel
You are with us
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Christ is the Lord
I come and behold You

Your name is a strong tower
I run to you when I'm safe
my greatest on the Lord is to speak Your name

Jesus, My Lord Jesus Emannuel
You are with us
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Christ is the Lord
I come and behold You

You've coverd me, delivered me
Lord I have set my love on You
i dwell within Your secret place
under shadows mighty God"
