"1" "Army Of God
Vineyard

We are the army of God,
Sons of Abraham
We are a chosen generation
Under a covenant,
Washed by His precious blood
Filled with the mighty Holy ghost

And I hear the sound of the coming rain
As we sing the praise to the Great I Am
And the sick are healed
And the dead will rise
And your church is the army
That was prophesied

Your church is the army"
