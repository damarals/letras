Lecrae

I been messed up (Yeah)
Stressed out with no luck (Yeah)
But every time I wake up (Yeah)
I get a chance to wake up (Yeah)
Thank God I got a chance to wake up
Wake up, another day to get my cake up, cake up (Yeah)
'Cause every time I wake up (Yeah)
I get a chance to wake up (Yeah)
Wake up, wake up

Wake up lil' slick, get up outta bed
You was like a couple steps away from being out of here
Thank you from my Granny prayers
Thank you for my potna 'n 'dem
I thought I was finished here
Jesus told me, \"Start again\"
I would party sundown 'til days end
Makin' money that I can't spend
I had a failing marriage and some fake friends
I had to doubt my doubts and let faith in
I was broken, God done brought me out like I was Moses
I'm chosen, woke up Sunday morning feeling focused
Funny actin', swipe left, that's on momma's
Always cappin', swipe left, yeah, no more drama
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm, boy, you know you blessed
Last night was a mess, God just hit refresh

I been messed up (Yeah)
Stressed out with no luck (Yeah)
But every time I wake up (Yeah)
I get a chance to wake up (Yeah)
Thank God I got a chance to wake up
Wake up, another day to get my cake up, cake up (Yeah)
'Cause every time I wake up (Yeah)
I get a chance to wake up (Yeah)
Wake up, wake up

Woke up in the new diablo
Father stretch me like I'm Pablo (Preach)
Sunday service on the front stoop
With a cup of tea in the condo
Tony Evans kicking convo'
Walking me through my storm
And I ain't grow up hearin' gospel
But I got it playing this morn'
I done been through this a time or two
I keep going back but now I'm finally through
I'm like \"If I was God, I'd be tired of you\"
But He be open arms like He desire you
I'm like wow, smokin', sippin', slippin', thought I lost my grip in, wow
Pulled me back and told me I'm forgiven

I woke up Sunday morning weight up on my chest (Yeah)
Had to remind myself that every day I'm blessed (Yeah)
'Cause every time I wake up (Yeah)
I get a chance to wake up (Yeah)
Thank God I got a chance to wake up
Wake up, another day to get my cake up, cake up (Yeah)
'Cause every time I wake up (Yeah)
I get a chance to wake up (Yeah)
Wake up, wake up (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Seasons change the colors so quickly
It's hard to keep up with the leaves
'Cause everybody leaves
On my birthday, Kobe, Gigi and seven souls remind me
That the tree of life is so uncertain
And tomorrow has unpredictabilities as colorful as the smiles that took off that day
May that Sunday morning resonate past trophies and trinkets and the ongoing pursuit of more
To sober us but the humbling truth
My life and your life, is just a vapor
And if what you see is all you see
Then you do not see all there is to be seen
Quickly
We leave"
