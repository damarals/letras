Hmm, hmm, hmm
(Novawav)
Hmm, hmm, hmm

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'ma ride for you, right or wrong, baby
Oh woah (Oh woah)
And I don't wanna let you go (Go, oh no)
Even though I know you ain't always good for me (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna let you go (Go, oh no)

I been on the road for a minute, rackin' up the miles
I been, dodgin' women, tryna hold you down
Listen, I'll be honest it get kinda wild
Throwin' parties in my section when I'm out of town
I know, I know I used to run the streets, baby
I was out there tryna hustle, makin' sure that we can eat, baby
I did my dirt but now I'm clean, lady
We fit together like a puzzle, ain't nobody else for me, baby

Let me come through, I can do what nobody else do for ya
Let me prove everything I gotta prove
Gone make a move, you know I'ma act a fool for you

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'ma ride for you, right or wrong, baby
Oh woah (Oh woah)
And I don't wanna let you go (Go, oh no)
Even though I know you ain't always good for me (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna let you go (Go, oh no)

I'm still
Still willing to love you
I'm still
Still willing to trust you
I'm still (Still)
Still rockin' with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna let you go (Go, oh no)

Twenty-five lighters on the dresser, got it blazin'
Burnin' all these bridges, misbehavin', goin' crazy
I been really out here prayin', thinkin' lately
I ain't actin' right, I know the way my momma raised me
I ain't mean no disrespect, I did you bad mami
But now I really need you bad mami
Lay you down in Puerto Rico, on the beach off in the sand, mami
And you the only one can handle me (Listen)

Let me come through, I can do what nobody else do for you
Let me prove everything I gotta prove
Go and make a move, you know I'ma act a fool for you

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'ma ride for you, right or wrong, babe
Oh woah (Oh woah)
And I don't wanna let you go (Go, oh no)
Even though I know you ain't always good for me (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna let you go (Go, oh no)

I'm still
Still willing to love you
I'm still
Still willing to trust you
I'm still (Still)
Still rockin' with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna let you go (Go, oh no)"
