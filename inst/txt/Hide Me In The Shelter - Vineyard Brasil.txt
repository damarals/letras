"1" "Hide Me In The Shelter
Vineyard Brasil

Under the shadow of your wings
Here in the secret place of your holiness
I will wait on you, oh Lord, my God and King
Here in the Holiest of All
You draw me near with love to abandon all
For the sake of knowing you, my God and King

Hide me in the shelter of your love
Deep in the center of your heart, my Lord
How I want to know you more
And keep me in the shadow of your wings
Safe in the secret place of holiness
How I need you more and more
(And more and more)

Hide me, and keep me, oh Lord
Safe in the secret place, safe in the secret place"
