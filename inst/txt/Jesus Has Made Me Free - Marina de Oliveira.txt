"1" "Jesus Has Made Me Free
Marina de Oliveira

Oh! No He didnt lie the day He died on calvary
There where He gave himself in love for you and me
Now on His name upon that cross We find our victory
No, I wont forget the way my Jesus loved so
And doesnt matter in this world Where I should go
I will follow the footsteps of Jesus my saviour
I wont look back, neither turn back
This world has made me nothing but put chains on me
But Jesus He has made me free

Jesus Christ has made me free
Jesus Christ has made me free

You see, maybe theres still some hope for you
And for this world of yours thats dying soon
As a victim of its sins it simply can go on
You see, for this world my Jesus didnt died in vain
It was for you He died in greatest pain
And He is faithfull even to do it all again"
