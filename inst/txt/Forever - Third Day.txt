Third Day

Lyrics & Music by Mac Powell

From the recording: Third Day, Track #2.

I see a hand reaching out to help me
But I don't understand all of Your ways
You are still the potter and I am just the clay
And though I know at times I am too proud
To reach for You, to help me out
But if I waited on myself to get it right
I would be waiting here forever

Chorus:
Your grace is never going to change
Your faith always will remain
Your love is the same yesterday, today, and forever

I see a world looking for an answer
but I don't know what for
When will we realize that we're sinners
in the hands of a loving God who came
and died and wants to set us free
How He longs to be with you and me
But if we waited on the truth to change
"
