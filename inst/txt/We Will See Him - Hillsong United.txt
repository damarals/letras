WE WILL SEE HIM
Words and Music by Reuben Morgan and Robert Fergusson

VERSE 1
I will lift my eyes
Only to God alone
I will set my heart
Trust in the holy One

VERSE 2
I will live in faith
Knowing His word is sure
Shout aloud to earth
Harvest is here and now

PRE CHORUS
Great is our God in all the earth
Great is our God in all the earth

CHORUS
We will see Him
Coming on the clouds of heaven
Exalted
We will see Him
High and lifted up He reigns
In majesty
In holiness
Almighty One

VERSE 3
I will live in hope
Jesus is coming soon
Let the nations sing
Glory to Christ our king

PRE CHORUS 2
We'll see the fullness of His word
All of His promises revealed

BRIDGE
See His glory
Shine forever
The light of all
Hallelujah
Lift Him higher
For our God reigns"
