"1" "Waiting On The Night To Fall
Casting Crowns

Theres an old man living
in the back of your woods tonight
You forgot he was even there
but you've never slipped his mind
Hes living off of scraps of you
you never knew you left behind
And as the sun goes down, he rises with a smile

Hes waiting on the night to fall
The old mans coming to call
You dont see the writing on the wall
Hell never step out in the light
No, he's just biding time
And while you slumber, hes gonna come and take it all
Hes waiting on the night to fall
Hes waiting on the night to fall

He knows you have the answers
but truth lies dusty on your shelf
And the sword that you could slay him
with has become an ornament and nothing else
You could put him back down in his hole in the ground
but he knows you never will
He's been around so long
you got used to the smell

He knows hell never have your soul
But he will gladly rob you blind
While youre feasting at his table
hell tie your hands and numb your mind
Hell take you farther than you wanna go
Hell keep you longer than you wanna stay
And it will cost you more
than you ever thought youd pay

He's waiting on the night
He's waiting on the night to fall
The old mans coming to call
But you dont see, you dont see the writing on the wall
He's waiting on the night
He's waiting on the night to fall
He's waiting on the night to fall"
