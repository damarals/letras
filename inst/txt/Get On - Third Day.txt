Lyrics by Mac Powell/Music by Third Day
From the recording: Come Together, Track #4.

So you think you had me
Had me in your sights
I've got news for you
I'm working over time
To get away from slander
To stay away from lies
I won't listen to you criticize

Get on, get on, get on away from me
If you're trying to bring me down
If you're trying to bring me down
Get on, get on, get on away from me
If you're trying to bring me down
If you're trying to bring me down

I've been doing some thinking
And I think you're wrong
For trying to put down
What I've been working on
So if you want to break me
You better stay away
I won't listen, no
I won't listen to you today

Excuse me if I still question
Carefully all of your intentions
I've decided that I won't listen
"
