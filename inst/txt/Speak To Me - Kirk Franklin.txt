"x"
"1" "Speak To Me
Kirk Franklin

Chorus:

Speak to me Lord, jesus
We need to hear from you
If you don't speak Lord, Jesus
We don't know what to do.

Repeat chorus 2x's

Me wake up in the mornin', and me see bright sunshine
Living without you jesus, I would have no peace of mind.

Your name I keep a callin', like a melody so sweet
If I could touch the hem of your garment, my life would be complete
Everybody say!

Chorus

Repeat chorus

Speak to me Oh, speak to me

Talk to me Oh, talkto me

shout with me Oh, shout with me

walk with me Oh, walk with me."
