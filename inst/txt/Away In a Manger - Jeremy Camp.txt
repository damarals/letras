"1" "Away In a Manger
Jeremy Camp

Away in a manger
No crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head
The stars in bright sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing
The poor baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying he makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
and stay by my side till morning is night

Be near me Lord
Be near me Lord
Be near me Lord
Be near me Lord

Be near me Lord Jesus
I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me, I pray
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And take us to heaven to live with You there

Will be with You, Lord Jesus
Will be with You, Lord
Will be with You"
