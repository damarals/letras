"1" "Bridge To Burn
P.O.D.

A chance given is an opportunity
Taken to prove the ones we're showing
All that we are made of and more
A moment to shine,
Not only fly, but soar.
Not only fly, but soar.
Not only fly...

Build me a bridge, so I can burn it down.
Shallow deep, come and watch me drown.
Take everything we have, and throw it all away.
I just want to, because I do.

You take it all in before you make up your mind
Accidents occur, a life changing time
Risk taking paid off, and look what we made
Luck or destiny, we're holding onto fate
Holding onto fate, Hold onto fate

Build me a bridge, so I can burn it down.
Shallow deep, come and watch me drown.
Take everything we have, and throw it all away.
I just want to, because I do.

Build me a bridge, so I can burn it down.
Shallow deep, come and watch me drown.
Take everything we have, and throw it all away.
I just want to, because I do.

Build me a bridge, so I can burn it down.
Shallow deep, come and watch me drown.
Take everything we have, and throw it all away.
I just want to, because I do.

Build me a bridge, so I can burn it down.
Shallow deep, come and watch me drown.
Take everything we have, and throw it all away.
I just want to, because I do."
