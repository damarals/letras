Hillsong United

Say the word and there is light
Say the word and dead bones rise
Every start and end hangs on Your voice
For Your word never return void

Written in a billion skies
Speaking to this heart of mine
All that I am with all creation
Hanging on every word that You've spoken
And it will not be shaken
Clinging for life to all Your promise
Hanging on every word that You say
It will remain
And my soul will hang on every word You say

Word made flash You wrote in grace
Promise kept through cross and grave
Over words of stone You spelled out love
And when You say: \"it is done\", it is done

Written in a billion skies
Speaking to this heart of mine
All that I am with all creation
Hanging on every word that You've spoken
And it will not be shaken
Clinging for life to all Your promise
Hanging on every word that You...
Written in a billion skies
Speaking to this heart of mine
All that I am with all creation
Hanging on every word that You've spoken
And it will not be shaken
Clinging for life to all Your promise
Hanging on every word that You say

It will remain
And my soul will hang on every word You say
Cause I know your word will never ever fail
And my soul will hang on every word You say"
