"1" "I've Got A Friend
Vineyard

I will wash the desert sand
I will breathe My life
I'll speak and break the fear
I will be

Will You be the rain
To wash the desert from me
Will You be the wind
When the calm steals my breath away
Will You be the quiet
When the voices won't stop
Will You be the provision
When my hands are not

Will You heal the scars
Too painful to touch
Will You wrestle my thoughts
Back from the dark
Will you make my walls
Salvation and peace
And let me in
Through the gates of praise

I will hold the broken reed
I will shine My light
My song will be your peace
I will be

(ENDING)
I've got a friend"
