"1" "Follow The Son
Hillsong United

You are the light
That guides my way through fear
I know my path
Will lead me to the King
And all the world
Will bow to worship You

You are the God
Who changed the world through one Holy Son
You gave everything
So all the world
Will bow in awe of You

You came down through grace
To show a better way

I follow the Son
He's the only One
Let his kingdom come
I'm giving it all
To the One I love
I follow the Son
Jesus holy One
Let Your will be done
I give it all to You
You are everything to me (4x)"
