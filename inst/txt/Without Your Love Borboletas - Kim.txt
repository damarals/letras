"1" "Without Your Love (Borboletas)
Kim

The reason why you left me
in the morning for another
makes me wonder
all day long
for all the things I've done for you
I thought this was a dream come true
it's over now for me and you

my life is a mess now
and I don't know what the future will hold from here
but I have to move on
even in pain my life will never be the same
without your love I will go on
a new love will come again
the feeling that I live for
it's a simple thing called love

without your love I will go on
a new love will come again
the feeling that I live for
it's a simple thing called love
I saw you last winter on a stormy night
a sparkle in your eyes, cold and bright

you spoke some words to me
I really tried to see
but then a gust of wind
blew those words away
my life is a mess now
and I don't now what
the future will hold from here
but I have to move on
even in pain my life will never be the same

without your love I will go on
a new love will come again
the feeling that I live for
it's a simple thing called love
without your love I will go on
a new love will come again

the feeling that I live for
it's a simple thing called love
I got your love, love again
I feel that I can fly
the feeling that I live for
it's a simple thing called love"
