"1" "The God I Know
Chris Tomlin

I've seen Your goodness
I've known Your mercy, countless times before
I've felt the thunder, I've heard the whisper
The voice that calms the storm
When the world is shaking, You're my firm foundtion, be still, be still my soul

The God I know will make a way, whatever comes, whatever I face
The God I know is strong to save, He is the Lord, He conquered the grave
And this is the God I know, and this is the God I know

I remember when the waters parted, how You lead me through
All I've needed, You have provideed, Your promises are true
When the world is shaking, You're my firm foundtion, be still, be still my soul

And I know You're working all things for my good
And I know You're working all things for my good

And this is the God I know, and this is the God I know

And I know You're working all things for my good
And I know You're working all things for my good

The God I know will make a way, whatever comes, whatever I face
The God I know is strong to save, He is the Lord, He conquered the grave"
