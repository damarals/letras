Third Day

Super Star Billy Brown
Whatcha’ doing to this town
Don’tcha know that everybody here
Wants to be like you

All of your adoring fans
Sitting in the seats and stands
Listening to every word you say
And watching every move
Once I saw a sign that said
“ Billy Brown for President”
It ain’t easy being a star
It ain’t easy to be who you are
It ain’t easy but you’re going far
Well, you say there’s nothing to it
But somebody’s gotta do it, boy

Super Star Billy Brown
Stop and listen to the crowd
Everywhere you go
Everybody’s screaming out your name

Do they know the reason why
You point your finger to the sky

We all are watching and expect
That whatever you are doing next
Well, it is gonna be the greatest thing
That we have ever seen"
