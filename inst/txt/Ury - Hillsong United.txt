I live for you, all that I am, all that I do...
My heart beats with u, and each day i wake...
i'll think of you...

*Chrous:
you are why I sing, you are why I live,
everything of me, I'll place it at your feet
you are why I love... you are why I give...
everything of me belongs to you...

I live for you... you are my God...
you are the truth...
you're all that I need, my soul in longs more of you
