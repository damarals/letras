Hillsong United

From the highest throne
To the earth below
You laid down your life
For the likes of us
Great is the love of the saviour

Lord of endless light
Let your glory shine forever
All the earth
All the earth
Sing your praise

Hope of every heart
Let your name be lifted higher
All our hearts
All our hearts
Sing your praise

God be exalted
God be exalted
In everything
We live for your glory
Live for your glory"
