"1" "In The Hands Of The Potter
Casting Crowns

I still remember when I heard You call me by name
I'd follow You anywhere, knew I could trust You with anything
But now sorrow beats down on me
waiting for You to come through
I'm all alone with my questions, I'm dry and cracked open
I thirst for You

And as I fall apart
Come flood this desert heart
Fall like the rain, living water
And I know Your way is best
Lord, help me find my rest
And I'll be the clay in the hands of the Potter

My world is spinning, my life seems so out of control
Nailed scarred hands tell the story of love
that will never let go of me
Through the sunshine or rain
I know where my hope is found
What You started in me
I know You will complete from the inside out

And as I fall apart
Come flood this desert heart
Fall like the rain, living water
And I know Your way is best
Lord, help me find my rest
And I'll be the clay in the hands of the Potter

My world is breaking me
Your love is shaping me
And now the enemy is afraid of what You're making me

And as I fall apart
Come flood this desert heart
Fall like the rain, living water
And I know Your way is best
Lord, help me find my rest
And I'll be the clay in the hands of the Potter
And I'll be the clay in the hands of the Potter"
