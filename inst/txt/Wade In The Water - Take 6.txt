"1" "Wade In The Water
Take 6

Wade in the water
Wade in the water children
Wade in the water
God's gonna trouble the water

Wade in the water
Wade in the water children
Wade in the water
God's gonna trouble the water

I woke up this morning
The sky was mighty gray
So I went to the river
Hopin the clouds would roll away
When I got down there
Looked up at the sky
A voice from up in heaven
Said \"You don't have to cry\"

Just wade in the water
Wade in the water
Wade in the water
God's gonna trouble the water

With everything I do
I stride for number one
If I put my mind to it
Lord I know it can be done
(I believe I can fly)
And with everything I've got
(I believe I can touch the sky)
With god's help I know
Dreams become reality
And I will reach my goal"
