"1" "Amen
Vineyard

Who was and is
And is to come
Here on the earth
Let His will be done

He never changes
He never sleeps
He rules with justice
And He reigns in peace

And we say Amen, amen
Amen, amen

He took on flesh
To bear our sin
Embraced the cross
And He rose again

So we are watching
And we wait
For the day approaching
When He comes again"
