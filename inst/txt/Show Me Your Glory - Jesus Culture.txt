"1" "Show Me Your Glory
Jesus Culture

I see the cloud, I step in
I want to see Your glory like Moses did
Flashes of light, rolls of thunder

Pre-Chorus:
Im not afraid
Im not afraid

Chorus:
Show me your glory
Show me your glory
Show me your glory

Show me your glory

Verse 2:

Im awed by your beauty, lost in your eyes
I want to walk in your presence, like Jesus did
Your glory surrounds me, and Im overwhelmed

Bridge:

I long to look on the face of the one that I love
Long to stay in your presence its where I belong"
