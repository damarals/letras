"1" "There Is None Like You
Vineyard

There is none like You.
No one else can touch my heart like you do.
And I can search throgh all eternity long
And find, there is none like You.

You mercy flows like river so wind
And healer comes from your hands.
Suffering children are safe in your arms,
There is none like You."
