"1" "One Desire
Jeremy Camp

I've been feelin'
Like I'm buried underneath
All the things that don't bring peace, oh
It's been stealin'
All the joy inside my soul
I've been tryin' to control, but the truth
Is nothing else will make me feel alive the way you do
Nothing else will bring the dark to light

Be my one desire
Burn up inside my heart just like a fire
Anything else that tries to satisfy's a liar
Help me lift you higher

Be my one desire (desire, dеsire)
Be my one dеsire (desire, desire, desire)

Break me
Down to whatever it takes
Just strip it all away, mm
Only one thing
That lasts through every age
Fingerprints on every page, it's you
Nothing else will ever take the place of who you are
Nothing else will ever take your place

Be my one desire (desire, desire)
Burn up inside my heart just like a fire (a fire, a fire)
Anything else that tries to satisfy's a liar
Help me lift you higher
Be my one desire (desire, desire)
The only thing my heart is chasing after (after, after)
Anything else that tries to satisfy's a liar
Help me lift you higher

Be my one desire

Your love is my home
And your peace is my hope
And I know that everything I need is found in you
Your love is my home
And your peace is my hope
And I know that everything I need is found in you

Be my one desire
Be my one desire

Be my one desire (desire, desire)
Burn up inside my heart just like a fire (a fire, a fire)
Anything else that tries to satisfy's a liar
Help me lift you higher
Be my one desire (desire, desire)
The only thing my heart is chasing after (after, after)
Anything else that tries to satisfy's a liar
Help me lift you higher

Be my one desire"
