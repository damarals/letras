Jesus Culture

Verse 1:
Found love beyond all reason
You gave Your life Your all for me
And called me Yours forever
Caught in the mercy fallout
I found hope found life
Found all I need
You're all I need

PreChorus:
The time has come
To stand for all we believe in
So I for one am gonna
Give my praise to You (Jesus)

Chorus:
Today, Today it's all or nothing
All the way
The praise goes out to You
Yeah all the praise goes out to You
Today, today I live for one thing
To give You praise
in everything I do

Bridge:
All we are is Yours
And all we're living for
Is all You are
Is all that You are Lord

Coda:
in everything I do;
yeah, all the praise goes out to You
