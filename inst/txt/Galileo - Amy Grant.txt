In the year of fourteen ninety-two
When Columbus sailed the ocean blue
Had he landed on India's shore
You might never have come to knock on my door.

Who needs a rhyme or a reason
Some dreams were made to find
So I know that I must follow
Ask me just how much I love you
You are starlight, I'm Galileo
Even on the darkest night oh
I will find the shining light of our love.

Through the rain clouds thundering nights
Mr. Franklin stood there holding his kite
He was crazy always pressing his luck
But he got what he wanted when lightning struck, yeah.

Who needs a rhyme or a reason
Some dreams were made to find
So I know that I must follow
Ask me just how much I love you
You are starlight, I'm Galileo
Even on the darkest night oh
I will find the shining light.

Ask me just how much I love you
You are starlight, I'm Galileo
Even on the darkest night oh
I will find the shining light of our love.

I believe in you and the special love we could share
And maybe one day darling you'll turn around
And all I really know is I will be there.

Who needs a rhyme or a reason
This dream was made to find
So I know that I will follow
Ask me just how much I love you
You are starlight, I'm Galileo
Even on the darkest night oh
I will find the shining light
I will find the shining light of our love.

Ask me just how much I love you
I'm Galileo
Even on the darkest night oh
I will find the shining light of our love
Ask me just how much I love you
I'm Galileo.
