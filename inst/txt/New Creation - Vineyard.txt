"1" "New Creation
Vineyard

I choose to sacrifice my life to You
I no longer live, but Christ lives in me
I have been crucified with Christ
I no longer live, but Christ lives in me
The life I live, I live by faith
In the Son of God
Who loved me and gave Himself for me

Therefore, if anyone is in Christ
He is a new creation
The old things have passed away
Everything is new"
