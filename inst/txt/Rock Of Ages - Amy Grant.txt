"1" "Rock Of Ages
Amy Grant

Rock Of ages cleft for me
Let me hide myself in thee
Rock of Ages, cleft for me
Let me hide myself in thee

Let the water and the blood
From thy riven side which flowed
Be of sin the double cure
Cleanse me from it's guilt and power

Nothing in my hand I bring
Simply to thy cross I cling
Nothing In my hand I bring
Simply to thy cross I cling

Naked, come to thee for dress
Helpless, look to thee for grace
Vile, I to the fountain fly
Wash me Savior, or I die

Rock of ages cleft for me
Let me hide myself in thee
Rock of Ages, cleft for me
Let me hide myself in thee"
