"1" "Stir In Me
Vineyard

Stir in me a fire that the world cannot explain
I come to worship you
Stir in me a passion that my heart cannot contain
I come to worship you

Hold me, break me
Mold me and make me more and more like you
I come to worship you
To Love you, to fear you, draw ever near you as I worship you
I come to worship you"
