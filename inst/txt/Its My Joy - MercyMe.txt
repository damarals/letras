"1" "It's My Joy
MercyMe

(Verse)
It's my joy to worship You
It's my joy to speak your name
It's my joy to be in your presence
It's my joy
It's my joy
(Verse)
It's my joy to please you Lord
It's my joy to honor you
It's my joy to give you glory
It's my joy
It's my joy
(Chorus)
I will sing hallelujah to my King
And I lay my heart down at your feet
And I pray that what you hear and what you see
Brings joy to Thee
Brings joy to Thee
