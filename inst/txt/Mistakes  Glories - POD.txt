P.O.D.

Handicap yourself by choice
and keep the mind confined to the chair with no voice
So speak up (move your lips too slow)
And make way to the center stage
And pretty up that face, cause your servants await.
(It's time to play your role)
So sing and dance just the way we like it!

Sweep The Leg!
If you don't stand for something
Sweep The Leg!
Then you don't stand for nothin
Sweep The Leg!
You must suffer the repercussions
Sweep The Leg!

A coward dies a thousand times
Death before dishonor, cross the thin red line
So stay alive, (No other place to go)
Silence the facts, delusions are corroded
clench the fist in truth and shove it down your throats
(Don't act like you don't know)
I'm on the wrong path walkin the tight rope

Sweep The Leg!
If you don't stand for something
Sweep The Leg!
Then you don't stand for nothin
Sweep The Leg!
You must suffer the repercussions
Sweep The Leg!

Mistakes & Glories!
They're in the ground, but they were cut down
Mistakes & Glories!
Death doesn't lie and it won't be denied
Mistakes & Glories!
We answer the call but some heroes must fall
Mistakes & Glories!
Giving all you can give when your dying to live

You work for us, You work for us
You work for us, You work for us
You work for us, You work for us
You work for us, You work for.....us!

Sweep The Leg!
If you don't stand for something
Sweep The Leg!
Then you don't stand for nothin
Sweep The Leg!
Gotta suffer the repercussions
Sweep The Leg!

Mistakes & Glories!
They're in the ground, but they were cut down
Mistakes & Glories!
Death doesn't lie and it won't be denied
Mistakes & Glories!
We answer the call but some heroes must fall
Mistakes & Glories!
Giving all you can give when your dying to live
Mistakes & Glories!
They're in the ground, but they were cut down
Mistakes & Glories!
Death doesn't lie and it won't be denied
Mistakes & Glories!
We answer the call but some heroes must fall
Mistakes & Glories!
Giving all you can give when your dying to live"
