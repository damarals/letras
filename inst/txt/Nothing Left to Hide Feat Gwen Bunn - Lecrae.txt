"1" "Nothing Left to Hide (Feat. Gwen Bunn)
Lecrae

Woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo

Uh, I got too much to say but haven't said enough
I called the music business bluff, I ain't famous enough
Huh, who cares if they think I'm saved enough
Grace is sufficient, my Blood Donor gave enough
And they be trippin' when they see a Christian
Like we over-religious and trying to bring conviction
They be waking up without a hope in sight
I turned to Christ on my darkest night
I ain't homophobic or anti-semitic
So give me lil' credit 'fore you give me edits
People see my faith in the cross as a loss
But I can't see me dying, bein' superstitious, yeah
And I ain't the picture of perfection
I lost my direction, I was smokin' and drinkin'
But I ain't forgot the resurrection
Only source of hope for a man in my position

I've been up all night
No runnin' from it, tryna make it right
'Cause I've been up too high
I'm, tryna make it alright, alright now
I just need some time
No runnin' from it, tryna make it right
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to hide

Uh, imagine you don't got nowhere to place faith
You just livin' life takin' up space
I can't see me livin' for nothin' at all
If ain't no God, what's the point of each day? Huh
What's the purpose of us wakin' up?
We just some cells on a cellphone?
Just a bunch of atoms hangin' in the attic?
Just some molecules in the mailroom?
Nah, I know I got purpose, I know I got passion
He purposed the package, I'm on a home team
Never good enough to get the love of Christ
But He good enough to get the love of me
I tried runnin' from 'em but His love track me down
Like a hound, ain't no other way around it
You either choose love or you choose death
I chose to let the love of God drown me

I've been up all night
No runnin' from it, tryna make it right
'Cause I've been up too high
I'm, tryna make it alright, alright now
I just need some time
No runnin' from it, tryna make it right
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to hide

Yeah, uh, now maybe this the end of a long run
Can't believe they let us make it this far
If you ask me how I did it, I'd be lyin' to you if I gave you any other answer but God
And I ain't deserve a day, ha
Matter of fact I missed a lot of plays
Matter of fact I dropped the ball way too many times and they still wonderin' how we won the game
Offense, drugs, divorce, addiction
Those the things you mention and you come up missin'
Tell me what's the mission if it ain't forgiveness?
Only two responses to sin: forgive and repentance
But we love to beat each other up
Instead of prayin' and workin' to heal each other, huh?
And I ain't finger pointin' at anybody but
If the shoe fits, go ahead and wear it, bruh

I've been up all night
No runnin' from it, tryna make it right
'Cause I've been up too high
I'm, tryna make it alright, alright now
I just need some time
No runnin' from it, tryna make it right
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to hide"
