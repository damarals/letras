Jesus Culture

We will run to Your arms
Give everything to You
We will run to You

Your, Your heart is full of love and mercy
Your, Your blood poured out
You were broken for us
We remember the price that You paid on the cross
Your love is calling, love is calling

We will run to Your arms
Give everything to You
We will run to You
Leave our past at the cross
Surrendered before You
We will run to You

Your, Your eyes they blaze
They are all consuming
Now our hearts are Yours, they burn for You only
We remember the price that you paid on the cross
Your love is calling, love is calling

We will run to Your arms
Give everything to You
We will run to You
Leave our past at the cross
Surrendered before You
We will run to You

With every heart
With all we are
We give You praise
You are our Saviour

With every heart
With all we are
We give You praise
You are our Saviour

With every heart
With all we are
We give You praise
You are our Saviour

With every heart
With all we are
We give You praise

We will run to Your arms
Give everything to You
We will run to You
Leave our past at the cross
Surrendered before You
We will run to You

We will run to Your arms
Give everything to You
We will run to You
Leave our past at the cross
Surrendered before You
We will run to You

We will run to You"
