"1" "Fall In Love With You
NÃ­vea Soares

Hold my hand
Lead me beyond the river
Your blood has made me pure
Lead me to your presence

I come running to you
I wanna take hold of you
Pour out my love over you, Jesus
I wanna capture your gaze
Give you all of my praise
I worship you with all of my strength
More and more and more

I want to fall in love with you, Jesus
And throw myself into your arms, Jesus
Beloved Jesus"
