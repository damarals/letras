Casting Crowns

Shes on her own, two girls at home
Thirteen years just up and walked away
And left her all alone
With bills to pay and mouths to feed
And every day shes taking care of everybody elses needs

But she's finding her strength
in the one love that wont ever leave her
So she works and she prays
and she loves and she stays cause they need her

These are the heroes, just ordinary people
Laying down their lives like angels in disguise
Theyre weak but always willing
They dare to do the hard things
And in the dark and desperate places no one else goes
Youll find the heroes
Youll find the heroes

He walks the halls, against the flow
He sees his high school as his mission field
Hes broken cause he knows
The hopeless road that they are taking
The empty feelings they are chasing
only lead to futures wasted
So hes willing to stand alone

He lives what he believes
when they all say its not worth believing
Every night on his knees
he prays god, wont you please help me reach them?

You may never know their names
But theyre moving mountains just the same
Instead of searching for the spotlight
Theyll follow Jesus into the darkest night

Heroes, these are the heroes

In the board room with a bible
In the classroom praying for revival
In third world countries, in downtown missions"
