Jesus Culture

The Lord is my Shepherd
He leads me on
Beside the still waters,
He restores my soul though
I walk through the valleys
I will not fear I know are you with me
I feel you here

I am in Safe in Your arms, Your arms
The Lord is my Shepherd
Through the darkest night
Though evil surrounds me
You defend my life

Goodness and mercy for all my days
In the house of my God
My heart will stay

I am in Safe in Your arms, Your arms
I am in Safe in Your arms, Your arms
I am in Safe in Your arms, Your arms
I am in Safe in Your arms, Your arms

Ooh, ooh, Hallelujah.. hallelujah
Ooh, ooh, Hallelujah.. hallelujah
Ooh, ooh, Hallelujah.. hallelujah
Ooh, ooh, Hallelujah.. hallelujah
Ooh, ooh, Hallelujah.. hallelujah

And my heart overflows
Forever I love you
I love you

I am in Safe in Your arms, Your arms"
