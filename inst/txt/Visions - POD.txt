P.O.D.

Prove to me, what I see
What I hear, my God
Prove to me, what I see
What I hear, my God

Take my pride, capture my flesh
Take my flesh, capture my pride
Take my pride, capture my flesh
Take my flesh, capture my pride

With the righteous wisdom
Spiritual insight
Check the knowledge

And it shall come to pass
Afterword
That I will pour out my spirit on all flesh
And your sons and your daughters shall prophesied
Your old men shall dream dreams
And your young men shall see visions

Jesus Christ is what I see
<Visions>
Jesus Christ is what I see
<Visions>
Jesus Christ is what I see
<Visions>
Jesus Christ is what I see
<Visions>

Prove to me, who I see
Who I hear, my God
Prove to me, who I see
Who I hear, my God
