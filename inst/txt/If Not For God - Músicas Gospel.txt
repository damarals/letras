"1" "If Not For God
MÃºsicas Gospel

If it wasn't for God,
There'd be no you and me.
The world wouldn't be here,
No one would have a destiny.

No stream would ever flow,
And the sun wouldn't shine.
The flowers wouldn't grow,
There'd be nothing to find.

Love, as we know it, Just might not exist,
If not for God, So much would be missed.

If it wasn't for God,
There'd be nothing to see.
No child would ever smile,
His love would be no mystery

No stream would ever flow,
And the sun wouldn't shine.
The flowers wouldn't grow,
There'd be nothing to find.

Love, as we know it, Just might not exist,
If not for God, So much would be missed."
