"1" "You Reign
Hillsong United

What could stand before you,
As you chose to embrace,
A cross so undeserved you took for me,
The weight of sin upon you,
When you offered your life,
As you walked the streets of men, with fading strength,

How could we live,
But not see, your sacrifice, your glory

Chorus

You reign, You reign,
Over everything Lord you reign,
With power and justice divine,
Over everything Lord you reign

What was your last thought,
As you drew your last breath,
Where the victory was yours for us to see,
And all will know the truth,
As we live by our grace, every praise to you alone,

How could we live,
But not see, your sacrifice, your glory

Chorus

Bridge

You reign, you reign,

See now the King of glory,
Love of God, become my calling,
Father I surrender,
All I am, to you forever
