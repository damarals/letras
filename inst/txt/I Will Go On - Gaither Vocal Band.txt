"1" "I Will Go On
Gaither Vocal Band

I repent for moments I have spent
Recalling all the pain and failures of my path
I repent for dwelling on the things
Beyond my power to change the chains that hold me fast

I will go on my past I leave behind me
I gladly take His mercy and His love
He is joy and He is peace
He strengthen and sweet relieves
I know He is and I am His
I will go on

I give up the bitterness and hate
The blaming man in fade
For all my discontent
The guilty and pain I am emptying from my cup
So God can fill it all with peace and sweet content

I will go on my past I leave behind me
I gladly take His mercy and His love
He is joy and He is peace
He strengthen and sweet relieves
I know He is and I am His

I will go on my past I leave behind me
I gladly take His mercy and His love
He is joy and he is peace
He strengthen and sweet relieves
I know He is and I am His

I will go on

Go on..."
