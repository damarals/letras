"x"
"1" "Forgiveness
Toby Mac

'Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we've all stepped across that line
But nothing's sweeter than the day we find
We find

It's hanging over him like the clouds of seattle
And raining' on his swag falling' deeper in the saddle
It's written on his face he don't have to speak a sound
Somebody call a 5 0 we gotta man down

You can go and play it like you're all rock and roll
But guilt does a job on each and every man's soul
And when your head hits the pillow at the nightfall
You can bet your life that it's gonna be a fight ya'll

Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we've all stepped across that line
But nothing's sweeter than the day we find
Forgiveness

And we all stumble and we fall
Bridges burn in the heat of it all
But nothing's sweeter than the day
Sweeter than the day we call
Out for forgiveness
We all need, we all need
We all need forgiveness
We all need, we all need

My momma told me what I would be in for
If I kept all this anger inside of me pent up
My heart been broken, my wounds been open
And I don't know if I can hear \"I'm sorry\" being spoken
But those forgiven much
Should be quicker to give it
And god forgave me for it all jesus bled forgiveness
So when the stones fly and they aimed at you
Just say, \"forgive them father, the know not what they do.\"

You can go and play it like you're all rock and roll
But guilt does a job on each and every man's soul
And when your head hits the pillow at the nightfall
You can bet your life that it's gonna be a fight ya'll

Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we've all stepped across that line
But nothing's sweeter than the day we find
Forgiveness

And we all stumble and we fall
Bridges burn in the heat of it all
But nothing's sweeter than the day
Sweeter than the day we call
Out for forgiveness
You know we need that, that, that
You know we need that, that, that
You know we need that, that, that
Let's talk to 'em

No matter how lost you are
You're not that far, you're not too far
No matter how hurt you are
You're not that far, you're not too far
No matter how wrong you are
You're not that far, you're not too far
No matter who you are
You're not that far, you're not too far
From forgiveness
Ask for forgiveness

Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we've all stepped across that line
But nothing's sweeter than the day we find
Forgiveness

And we all stumble and we fall
Bridges burn in the heat of it all
But nothing's sweeter than the day
Sweeter than the day we call
Out for forgiveness
We all need, we all need
We all need forgiveness
We all need, we all need

No matter how lost you are
We all need
No matter how hurt you are
We all need
No matter how wrong you are
You're not that far, you're not too far
No matter who you are
You're not too far, you're not too far

We all need forgiveness"
