"1" "God Gave The Song
Gaither Vocal Band

You ask me why my heart keeps singing
why I can sing when things go wrong.
But since I've found the source of music
I just can't help it. God gave the song.

Come walk with me thru fields and forests.
We'll climb the hills and still hear that song.
For even hills resound with music.
They just can't help it. God gave the song.

What's that I hear - I still hear that music
day after day. that song goes on.
For once you know the source of music
you'll always hear it. God gave the song.

Come on and join - It's the song of Jesus
day after day that song goes on
For once you know the source of music
you'll always hear it. God gave the song.
For since I've found the source of music
I just can't help it. God gave the song."
