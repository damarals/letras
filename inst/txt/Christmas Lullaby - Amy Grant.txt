"1" "Christmas Lullaby
Amy Grant

Are you far away from home
This dark and lonely night
Tell me what best would help
To ease your mind
Someone to give
Direction for this unfamiliar road
Or one who says, \"Follow me and I
will lead you home.\"

How beautiful
How precious
The Savior of all
To love so
Completely
The loneliest soul
how gently
how tenderly
He says to one and all,
\"Child you can follow Me an
I will lead you home
Trust Me and follow Me
And I will lead you home.\"

Be near me, Lord Jesus
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care
And take us to Heaven
To live with Thee there
Take us to Heaven
To live with Thee there
