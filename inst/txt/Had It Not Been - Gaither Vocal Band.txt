"1" "Had It Not Been
Gaither Vocal Band

Just suppose God searched through Heaven,
And couldn't find one willing to be,
The supreme sacrifice that was needed,
That would buy eternal life for you and me


Had it not been for a place called Mount Calvary,
Had it not been for the old rugged cross,
Had it not been for a man called Jesus,
Then forever my soul would be lost


Well I'm so glad He was willing to drink His bittercup,
Although He prayed \"Father let it pass from me\",
And I'm so glad He never called Heaven's angels,
From these hands, Pulled the nails that torment me


Then forever my soul would be lost"
