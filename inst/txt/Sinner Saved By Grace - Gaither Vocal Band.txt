"1" "Sinner Saved By Grace
Gaither Vocal Band

If you could see what I once was
If you could go with me
Back to where I started from
Then I know you would see
A miracle of love that took me
In its sweet embrace
And made me what I am today
Just an old sinner saved by grace.

I'm just a sinner saved by grace
When I stood condemned to death
He took my place
Now I live and breathe in freedom
With each breath of life I take
Loved and forgiven
Back with the living
I'm just a sinner saved by grace

How could I boast of anything
I've ever seen or done?
How could I dare to claim as mine
The vict'ries God has won?
Where would I be had God
Not brought me gently to this place?
I'm here to say I'm nothing
But a sinner saved by grace

I'm just a sinner saved by grace
When I stood condemned to death
He took my place
Now I live and breathe in freedom
With each breath of life I take
Loved and forgiven
Back with the living
I'm just a sinner saved by grace"
