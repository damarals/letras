Stryper

In a land of freedom
God has sent His grace
We're proud to live in such a place

With the right to sing
Song after song
This song's for you to sing along!

Whoa-o-o-o Whoa ooo La, La
Whoa-o-o-o Whoa ooo La, La

Lift your voices higher
We want to hear you sing
Let's lift our voices to the King of King's
