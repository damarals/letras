Third Day

I am a thief, I am a murderer
Walking up this lonely hill
What have I done? I don't remember
No one knows just how I feel
And I know that my time is coming soon.
It's been so long. Oh, such a long time
Since i've lived with peace and rest

Now I am here, my destination
Guess things work out for the best.
And I know that my time is coming soon.

Who is this man? This man beside me
They call the king of the jews
They don't believe that he's the messiah
But, somehow I know it's true.

And they laugh at him in mockery,
And beat him till he bleeds
They nail him to the rugged cross,
And raise him, they raise him up next to me

My time has come, I'm slowly fading
I deserve what I receive
Jesus when you are in your kingdom
Could you please remember me

And he looks at me still holding on
The tears fall from his eyes
He says I tell the truth
Today, you will live with me in paradise

And I know that my time is coming soon
And I know that my time is coming soon
And I know paradise is coming soon."
