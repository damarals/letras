"1" "Never Going Back
Skillet

Can you hear me?
Never
Can you hear me?
Never
Can you hear me?

I used to be caged
Never stood my ground
I lived like your slave
Those days are over now

Oh no
You will never know me
Let go
You will never own me
No more
Like before
Never gonna be
Never gonna be yours

All my life
I'm never going back
I never say die
And I ain't starting yet
Tell no lies
I'm never going back
My back's against the wall
But I know who I am
Never go
Never goin' back

Never
Can you hear me?
Never

Like an angel of light
You pull me close again
Devil in a disguise
The teeth are sinking in

Oh no
You will never know me
Let go
You will never own me
No more
Like before
Never gonna be
Never gonna be yours

All my life
I'm never going back
I never say die
And I ain't starting yet
Tell no lies
I'm never going back
My back's against the wall
But I know who I am
Never go
Never goin' back

Oh no
You will never know me
Let go
You will never own me
No more
Like before
Never gonna be
Never gonna be yours

All my life
I'm never going back
I never say die
And I ain't starting yet
Tell no lies
I'm never going back
My back's against the wall
But I know who I am

All my life (Never gonna be, never gonna be yours)
I'm never going back
I never say die (Never gonna be, never gonna be yours)
And I ain't starting yet
Tell no lies (Never gonna be, never gonna be yours)
I'm never going back
My back's against the wall (Never gonna be, never gonna be yours)
But I know who I am
Never go
Never goin' back

Never go
Never goin' back

Never
Can you hear me?
Never
Can you hear me?"
