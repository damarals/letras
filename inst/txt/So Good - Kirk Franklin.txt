So Good

When I lift my hands i'm telling you thank You
Every time I shed tears of joy, I'm saying I love You
Because I realize, You didn't have to do what You
did But You did anyhow You been, so good, oh
yeah so good

God has been, been so good, God has been,
He's been so good

God has been so good, so good, So good....
