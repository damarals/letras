"1" "Find A Way
Amy Grant

You tell me your friends are distant,
You tell me your man's untrue,
You tell me that you've been walked on,
And how you feel abused.

So you stand here an angry young woman,
Taking all the pain to heart.
I hear you saying that you want to see changes,
But you don't know how to start.

Chorus:
Love will find a way, (How do you know?)
Love will find a way, (How can you see?)
I know it's hard to see the past and still believe
Love is gonna find a way.
I know that
Love will find a way, (A way to go.)
Love can make a way, (Only love can know.)
Leave behind the doubt;
Love's the only out;
Love will surely find a way.

I know this life is a strange thing.
I can't answer all the why's.
Tragedy always finds me,
Taken again by surprise.

I could stand here an angry young woman,
Taking all the pain to heart.
But I know that love can bring changes,
And so we've got to move on.

(Repeat Chorus)

If our God His Son not sparing
Came to rescue you,
Is there any circumstance
That He can't see you through?

(Repeat Chorus Twice)
