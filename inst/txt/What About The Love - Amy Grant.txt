"1" "What About The Love
Amy Grant

I went to see my sister.
She was staying with a friend
Who had turned into a preacher
To save the world from sin.
He said, \"First deny your body,
And then learn to submit.
Pray to be made worthy,
And tithe your ten percent.\"
I said, \"Is this all there is,
Just the letter of the law?\"
Something's wrong.

I went to see my brother
On the 32nd floor
Of a building down on Wall Street;
You could hear the future's roar.
He said, \"Here we make decisions,
And we trade commodities;
If you tell me where there's famine,
I can make you guarantees.\"
I said, \"Is this all there is,
Power to the strong?\"
Something's wrong.

Something's wrong in heaven tonight.
You can almost hear them cry.
Angels to the left and the right,
Saying, \"What about the love?
What about the love?
What about the love?\"

I went to see my neighbor.
He'd been taken to a home
For the weak and the discarded
Who have no place to go.
He said, \"Here I lack for nothing;
I am fed and I am clothed.
But at times I miss the freedom
I used to know.\"
I said, \"Is this all there is,
When your usefulness is gone?\"
Something's wrong.

Something's wrong in heaven tonight. (Something's wrong.)
You can almost hear them cry. (Cry.)
Angels to the left and the right,
Saying, \"What about the love?
What about the love?
What about the love?\"

(Yeah, yeah, yeah....)

(Yeah.)

(Yeah.)

I looked into the mirror, (Yeah.)
Proud as I could be, (Yeah.)
And I saw my pointing finger (Yeah.)
Pointing back at me,
Saying, \"Who named you accuser? (Yeah.)
Who gave you the scales?\" (Yeah.)
I hung my head in sorrow; (Yeah.)
I could almost feel the nails.
I said, \"This is how it is
To be crucified and judged
Without love.\"

Something's wrong in heaven tonight. (Something's wrong.)
You can almost hear them cry. (Cry.)
Angels to the left and the right,
Saying, \"What about the love?
What about the love?
What about the love of God?\"

Something's wrong in heaven tonight. (Something's wrong.)
You can almost hear them cry. (Cry.)
Angels to the left and the right,
Saying, \"What about the love?\"
What about the love?
What about the love of God?\"

Something's wrong in heaven tonight. (Something's wrong.)
You can almost hear them cry. (Cry.)
Angels to the left and the right,
Saying, \"What about the love?
What about the love?
What about the love...?\"
