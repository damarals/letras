Third Day

I wanna be a rock star
But, I ain’t got what it takes
The drive and the determination
And the lucky breaks
I wanna be a rock star
But, I ain’t got the face
I wanna be a rock star
But, I ain’t got what it takes

Seeing my face up on the TV
Hearing my songs on the radio
People waiting all day in line to see me
Doing my pose for Rolling Stone

Well, it’s alright, yeah it’s alright

Living lifestyles of the rich and famous
Turning all heads in the music scene
Flying in my own jet plane to Vegas
Riding in a big black limousine

Well, it’s alright, yeah it’s alright

No, I ain’t got nothing
But, to you I’m something
Something so much more"
