"1" "Open The Eyes of My Heart
Michael W. Smith

Open the eyes of my heart Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You

Open the eyes of my heart Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You
Open the eyes of my heart Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You

Open the eyes of my heart Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You

To see you high and lifted up
Shining in the light of your glory
Pour out your power and love
As we sing holy, holy, holy

High and lifted up
Shining in the light of your glory
Pour out your power and love
As we sing holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy

High and lifted up
Shining in the light of your glory
Pour out your power and love
As we sing holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy

Holy, holy, holy
I want To See You
holy, holy Holy,
holy, holy Holy

I want To See You
You Are Holy
Holy Holy Holy

I want To See You
Holy Holy Holy
I want See You"
