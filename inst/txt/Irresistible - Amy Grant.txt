"x"
"1" "Irresistible
Amy Grant

Out on the edge I've been drifting in darkness lately
Carrying our hearts so confused
Standing on the ledge you still hold me when life gets crazy
Where would I be without you

CHORUS /CORO:
And your irresistable love that is saving me
I've been running on your
oh oh yeah
Irrisistbale love is amazing me
You touched my soul
Only you make me whole

VERSE2/VERSO 2:
Can't run away from a love that is all around me
Melting the hardest of hearts
So overwhelmed with the mercy that sort and found me
I should have known from the start

CHORUS/CORO:
It's your irresistable love that is saving me
I've been running on your
oh oh yeah
Irrisistbale love is amazing me
You touched my soul
Only you make me whole

BRIDGE/PUENTE:
And I'm captivated
By the way
You reach for me
So faithfully

do-do-do, do do do, do, do do do do do :||

CHORUS/CORO:
It's your irresistable love that is saving me
I've been running on your
oh oh yeah
Irrisistbale love is amazing me
You touched my soul
Only you make me whole"
