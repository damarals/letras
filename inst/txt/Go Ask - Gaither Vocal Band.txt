"1" "Go Ask
Gaither Vocal Band

Don't ask me to explain to you
How one could start again
Or hardened hearts
Could soften like a child

Don't ask me how to reason out
The mysteries of life
Or how to face it's problems
With a smile

Go ask the man who's found a way
To take a rose to stay
When all communications were destroyed

Go ask the child who's walking now
Who once was crippled
And then somehow her useless legs
Were made to jump for joy

Go ask the one who's burned out mind
Has been restored
I think you'll find the questions
Not as important as before

Don't ask me if He's good or bad
I only know the guilt I had is gone
And I can't tell you any more

And don't ask me how to prove to you
Why I know God is there or how I know
That He would care for you

And don't ask me why someone so great
Would chose to walk with me
And trade my broken life for one that's new

Go ask the child whose got a dad
To love away the hurt he had
Before this man called Jesus
Touched their lives

Go ask the one whose fears have fled
Whose churning heart was quieted
When someone whispered peace
To all her strive

Go ask the man to tell you more
Whose life was just a raging war
In spite of self until the savior came

I don't pretend to be so wise
I only know He touched my eyes
And nothing else will ever be the same

I don't pretend to be so wise
I only know He touched my eyes
And nothing else will ever be the same

And nothing else will ever be the same"
