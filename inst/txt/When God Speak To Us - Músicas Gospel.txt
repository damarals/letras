"1" "When God Speak To Us
MÃºsicas Gospel

Anytime we're feeling down,
The Devil tempts our mind.
But If we read Gods words,
We will leave him behind.

If we call out for help,
We'll never have to wait.
The words in the bible,
Will bring us some faith.

When God speaks to us,
We hear him with our heart.
Anytime that we are happy,
That's where the feelings start.

Be aware of things you feel,
And listen to what you hear.
When the lord has a message,
You will receive it clear.

He watches what you do,
He hears all that you say.
So if you're needing help,
Let the Lord guide your way.

When God speaks to us,
We hear him with our heart.
Anytime that we are happy,
That's where the feelings start"
