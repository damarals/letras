Lord I'm amazed at everything you've done for me (unison),
For every battle you have given victory (unison),

You are so awesome (x4),
Oh Lord we give you praise,

Let all the earth rejoice and proclaim,
That there is no other name that is above your name,
You are the King,
Forever you shall reign,
