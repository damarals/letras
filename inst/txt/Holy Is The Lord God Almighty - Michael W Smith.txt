Michael W. Smith

\"we stand and lift up our hands
For the joy of the lord is our strength
We bow down and worship him now
How great, how awesome is he

And together we sing
Everyone sing

Holy is the lord god almighty
The earth is filled with his glory
Holy is the lord god almighty
The earth is filled with his glory
The earth is filled with his glory

We stand and lift up our hands
For the joy of the lord is our strength
We bow down and worship him now
How great, how awesome is he

And together we sing
Everyone sing

Holy is the lord god almighty
The earth is filled with his glory
Holy is the lord god almighty
The earth is filled with his glory
The earth is filled with his glory

It's rising up all around
It's the anthem of the lord's renown
It's rising up all around
It's the anthem of the lord's renown

And together we sing
Everyone sing

The earth is filled with his glory
The earth is filled with his glory
