"1" "Don't Want To Grieve You
Vineyard

I don't want to grieve You
You are my precious lover
I don't want to wound You
Outside You there is no other

Who longs to be close to me
Who longs to be close to me

So ƒOll me with light again
The darkness will ƒPee at Your name
You're so full of love
And it's You that I want
So come take Your place once again"
