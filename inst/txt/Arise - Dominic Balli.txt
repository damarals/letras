It's time we get up from this grave we been digging
Bury the old man, let the new one start livin
Move on to something better
Live on for something better
It's time we stop clinging to the world like it's home, stop lying with the enemy and return to the fold
Live on for something better
Look up for something better
The son is on his way
So carefully walk and seize the day

Refrão:
We must arise
We must arise
We must arise
We must arise
Arising for the better day

It's time to arise from the plague of the fall
To abandon fear and step up to the call
Move on to something better
Live on for something better
It's time we stop clinging to the world like it's home, stop lying with the enemy and return to the fold
Live on for something better
Look up for something better
Wake up from your dreaming
And march on like you got some reason to believe in

(Refrão)

We got to take up our bed and arise
We got to take up our bed and arise
We got to take up our bed and arise
We got to take up our bed and arise
Rise up from the grave
Move on seize the day
Rise up from the grave
Move on seize the day
We must arise
