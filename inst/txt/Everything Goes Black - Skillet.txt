Skillet

Chasing these shadows around this darken room
I' ve laid here so long I don' t even want to move
I need a minute now to heal
I need a minute now to remember how to feel

Whenever you' re gone away
The darkness hides the day
Whenever you' re gone the bleeding won' t stop
It hurts till you come back
Everything goes black
Everything goes black

I reached out for yousentir and I needed you to be here
All alone chasing these shadows
I don't want the pain but I'd rather hurt than not care
It's so long, you've been away from here
I need a reason now to heal
I need something to believe in
I need a reason now to remember to feel

Whenever you' re gone away
The darkness hides the day
Whenever you' re gone the bleeding won' t stop
It hurts till you come back
Everything goes black
Everything goes black

Give me something to believe in
I still believe in you
But if you' re never here and I' m left all alone
Tell me what am I supposed to do

Whenever you' re gone away
The darkness hides the day
Whenever you' re gone the bleeding won' t stop
It hurts till you come back
Everything goes black

Everything goes black
Everything goes black"
