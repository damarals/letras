"x"
"1" "First Love
Kirk Franklin

I know they hurt you
They saw you stumble but didn't help you
And now they left you
They were quick to pray but slow to move

And now you're empty
Too tired to run, you walk away
In the night there's a voice
If you listen He sweetly says

Come back to your first love [first love 2x]
Come back home, come back where you belong
Come [to your 2x] first love

You didn't make it
You thought your love would last forever
Ain't it funny how a chapter can make the story change
Cold and lonely, you never knew hurt could feel this way
Understand there's a plan if you're patient
Hear the savior say

God is able to heal if you listen
And He'll show you His will is you listen
But you gotta be still and just listen, listen
Home... Home... Home... I'm Home [repeat]
