"1" "I've Seached For Gold
Delirious

I've searched for gold and I've longed for the silver
I've climbed the mountain for one glance of a jewel
I won't be satisfied 'til I've found what I've come for
I won't be satisfied 'til I meet with you

I felt the coal it burned on my lips
Then there were diamonds you brought to my side
And I'll be poor if it means I can find
More of a passion for the secrets you hide

Is there hope enough these days to forgive
someone like me
Is there grace enough these days to forgive
someone like me"
