"1" "Keeper Of My Heart
Kari Jobe

From the first to the last breath I breathe
The Lord watches over me
You hear my cry and you know every need
The Lord watches over me
You never fail me God

I lift my eyes, I lift my eyes up
Maker of the heaven
Keeper of my heart
I lift my hands, I lift my hands up
Standing in your presence
You are never far

I look to You where my help comes from
The Lord watches over me
Your mercies are new with the morning sun
The Lord watches over me
You never fail me God

I lift my eyes, I lift my eyes up
Maker of the heaven
Keeper of my heart
I lift my hands, I lift my hands up
Standing in your presence
You are never far
You are never far
Keeper of my heart

Keeper of my heart
Jesus you are
My strength
Never ending love
I know You have overcome
I'll sing when all is said and done
My hope, my only hope
My strength, never ending love
I know you have overcome
I'll sing when all is said and done
You're my hope, my only hope

I lift my eyes, I lift my eyes up
Maker of the heaven
Keeper of my heart
I lift my hands, I lift my hands up
Standing in your presence
You are never far
You are never far

Keeper of my heart
Keeper of my heart
Jesus you are
Keeper of my heart"
