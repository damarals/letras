"1" "Peace
Britt Nicole

(La, la, la-la-la) oo-yeahh-yeahh. (la, la, la-la-la)
Your giving eye again; drowning in my sorrow and pain
Looking for the right direction standing all alone in the rain
I can't seem to find that open door, it's a battle every day
My heart is torn and my will is gone and nothing seems to go my way

Rent me peace, rent me joy, these are things the world destroys; but if I call on you, you will comfort me and I will have these things eternally- eternally

(La, la, la-la-la)
When my dreams are shattered and ruined and there are no places to run
When the storm keeps getting stronger and I cannot see the sun, all I have to do, is call on his name when I'm feeling lost and confused (yeahh)
He will grant me peace and he'll grant me joy, I know that his promise is true!

Rent me peace, rent me joy, these are things the world destroys; but if I call on you, you will comfort me and I will have this peace eternally- eternally

(La, la, la-la-la)

Rent me peace, rent me joy, these are things the world destroys; but if I call on you, you will comfort me and I will have these things eternally, eternally"
