"1" "Remember (isaiah 44:21-22)
Vineyard

I have made you, you are my servant
I will not forget you
I have swept away your offenses like a cloud
Your sins like the morning mist

Remember these things
Remember these things
Remember these things
And know you are loved, you are loved

I have called you, my favor is upon you
I will not forget you
I will walk with you every moment of your life
My presence surrounding you"
