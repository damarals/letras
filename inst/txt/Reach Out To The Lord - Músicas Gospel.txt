"1" "Reach Out To The Lord
MÃºsicas Gospel

If the road is empty and you walk alone,
And there's no love in an unhappy home.
Should you grow weary of fighting it all,
Reach out to the Lord he will hear your call.

He hears every prayer that's faithful and true,
He will walk by our side in all that we do.
At the time we lose faith he'll pull us through,
Reach out to the Lord he's waiting for you.

Chorus:
Reach out to the Lord
Show him your faith,
Whenever he's needed,
You won't have to wait.

If your life is filled with sorrow and full of fears,
You have a lot of worries and there's no one to care.
If you are tired and beaten and you've lost your way,
Reach out to the Lord and talk to him today.
Chorus:
Reach out to the Lord
Show him your faith,
Whenever he's needed,
You won't have to wait."
