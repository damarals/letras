"1" "Were You There
Selah

Were you there when they crucified my LordWere you there when they crucified my LordSometimes it causes me to tremble, trembleWere you there when they crucified my Lord

And were you there when they laid Him in the tombWere you there when they laid His precious body in the tombSometimes it causes me to tremble, I cry and I trembleWere you there when they laid Him in the tomb

Were you there when He rose from the graveWere you there when my Jesus rose from the graveSometimes it makes me want to shoutAnd I cry and I begin to tremble, I trembleWere you there when He rose from the grave
