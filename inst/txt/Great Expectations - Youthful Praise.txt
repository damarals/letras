"1" "Great Expectations
Youthful Praise

For I know the plans that I have for you saith the lord
And I know the thoughts that I think towards you declares the lord
For I know the plans that I have for you saith the lord
And I know the thoughts that I think towards you declares the lord

Thoughts of peace, not of evil
Plans to prosper, not to harm you
Give you hope and a future
Now you can have great expectations

Oh, oh, oh, oh...

Inside of me, I do believe
I have, great expectations

Great expectations, great expectations..."
