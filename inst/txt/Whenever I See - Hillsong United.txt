"1" "Whenever I See
Hillsong United

Verse 1:
Whenever I see Your face
Then all of my fears can fly
Whenever I clearly hear
The times when I ask You why
Whenever I feel Your arms
Whenever You hold me close
For then I will see Your face
As I am found in You


Verse 2:
Lead me to know You more
And help me to understand
You cause me to see in faith
All of Your dreams and plans
For faith is perfected now
In living and loving You
In hope never wavering
Completely found in You


Chorus:
Now the heavens can be home
For my spirit has been freed
And my soul it rests in You,
Your life is found in me.
And this death it ends in life
With this faith in love fulfilled
And my eyes will finally see Your face
