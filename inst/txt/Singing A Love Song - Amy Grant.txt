"1" "Singing A Love Song
Amy Grant

Well, I may not get applause every night when I sing,
And I may not hear the cheers of a crowd.
And my voice can't always rise to make the mountains ring,
And at times I can't even sing out aloud.

But you've got me singing a love song,
Melody and rhyme;
It moves me every time.
You've got me singing a love song,
And it keeps you on my mind, ooooh, on my mind.
Feelin' fine all the time.
It keeps you on my mind.

Sometimes my voice is strained and the strings won't hold a tune.
My back is sore, and I'm just too tired to try,
And I don't want to work or rest or think of you,
Or face the world or even close my eyes.

But you've got me singing a love song,
Melody and rhyme;
It moves me every time; I know that,
You've got me singing a love song,
And it keeps you on my mind, ooooh, on my mind.
Feelin' fine all the time.
It keeps you on my mind.

My broken dreams, they don't bother me,
And hard times in life I don't mind.
I think of things that I'd rather see,
And you give me piece of mind.

Hard times will come and sometimes I won't wanna sing,
But I'll sing with all the love that I can find.
And I'm happy there to hear me in the silence of my song.
I'm gonna sing for you until the end of time.

'Cause you've got me singin' a love song,
Melody and rhyme;
It moves me every time.
You've got me singing a love song,
And it keeps you on my mind, ooooh, on my mind.
Feelin' fine all the time.
It keeps you on my mind.

And it keeps you on my mind.
You've got me singin' a love song.
And it keeps you on my mind.
You've got me singin' a love song...."
