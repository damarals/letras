"1" "Chance Of A Lifetime
Take 6

Sometimes the heart can lead you
Where few have ever been
Cant take you to the limit
Time and time again
Something moves the spirit
Like something moves the wind
I felt it and I followed
Now the road's about to end

Chorus:
This is the chance of a lifetime
Can't let it slip away
This is the moment I've dreamed of
It all comes down today
Whatever it takes
I'm willing to give
I know I was born to live
For the chance
The chance of a lifetime

We find our own direction
We make our own mistakes
Some take the road that's easy
Some play for higher stakes
It's been a long time coming
But it's been worth the wait
'Cause now I know I'm ready
To touch the hand of fate

Chorus
