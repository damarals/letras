"1" "Stealing Time
Delirious

I need a lonely day with you, sometime.
I need to get away with you, sometime.
I've got a crowd of things going on, in my mind.
I need a lonely day with you, sometime.
Sometimes, I never get there, sometimes.

Stealing time, Am I forever.
Stealing time to be with you.

I remember love's first days,
Precious moments, we had all the time in the world.
Still You thrill me, still You heal me.
Still need a lonely day with you, sometime.
Sometimes, I never get there.
Sometimes, can I ever get there?

This time, will I ever really get there?"
