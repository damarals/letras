Cook that **** up, Quay

Woo, ooh
We been too lit, we been too true, ain't no fraud (Ain't no fraud)
I go too lit, I got too turnt on these bars (Turnt on these bars)
I can't quit, I'm too legit, I gotta keep goin' (I keep goin')
I gotta get it, I keep scorin', gotta keep goin', yeah

Quaterbackin' (Uh)
Pitchin' them packs, they tryna sack me
If they catch me lackin' (Woo)
Lock me up inside a dragon, yeah, yeah
Belly of the beast, swallowed my cousin, I got the keys, yeah, yeah
We never had no daddy, daddy was runnin' the streets
Still we made it out the pit, thirty clips, get you hit
My whole clique still' 116, in your hood like it's '06 (Ooh)
Keep my hand up on my hip (Brrt)
Pray to God nobody trip
Hit you with that truth, it turn a sinner saint inside a minute

Woo, ooh
We been too lit, we been too true, ain't no fraud (Ain't no fraud)
I go too lit, I got too turnt on these bars (Turnt on these bars)
I can't quit, I'm too legit, I gotta keep goin' (I keep goin')
I gotta get it, I keep scorin', gotta keep goin', yeah

I was down, at the bottom, got it out the mud (Hmm, hmm, yeah)
Kept it goin', even when they never showed me love (Hmm, hmm, yeah)
Momma said it would come a time I would struggle (Hmm, hmm, yeah)
Keep your hands to the ceiling when you see the troubles (Hmm, hmm, yeah)

Woo, ooh
Run that, run that, we just runnin' up the score
Woo, ooh
Come back, come back, this my season, hit my goals (Carvello)
I can't quit, I've come too far to let it go
Woo, ooh
Told all my partners, hold your head until we home
We never quit, we just do it 'til death
I ain't gon' go 'til no life in my breath
After they carry and burry me, tell 'em don't worry
I'll be back to finish my reps
I don't care what all them critics are sayin'
I been to Hell and back, I know the plan
When you survive what we been through you
You come back on ten and you ain't never gon' see it the same

Woo, ooh
We been too lit, we been too true, ain't no fraud (Ain't no fraud)
I go too lit, I got too turnt on these bars (Too turnt on these bars)
I can't quit, I'm too legit, I gotta keep goin' (I keep goin')
I gotta get it, I keep scorin', gotta keep goin', yeah

I was down, at the bottom, got it out the mud (Hmm, hmm, yeah)
Kept it goin', even when they never showed me love (Hmm, hmm, yeah)
Momma said it would come a time I would struggle (Hmm, hmm, yeah)
Keep your hands to the ceiling when you see the troubles (Hmm, hmm, yeah)
