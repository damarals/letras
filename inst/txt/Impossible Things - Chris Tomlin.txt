"1" "Impossible Things
Chris Tomlin

You heal the broken hearted
You set the captive free
You lift the heavy burden
And even now, you are lifting me

There is no healer like the lord our maker
There is no equal to the king of kings, oh
Our god is with us, we will fear no evil
'cause you do, impossible things

'cause you do, impossible things

Though I walk through the valley
Darkness surrounding me
There you prepare a table
In the presence of my enemies

You do, the impossible, possible

One word, and the walls start falling
One word, and the blind will see
One word, and the sinner's forgiven
'cause you do impossible things

You do more than I could ask
Or even imagine
You are more than I could ask
You're more than enough

Yes, even now, you are lifting me
Oh, even now, you are lifting me
'cause you do impossible things"
