For Today

What have we done? What have we become?
A broken mirror reflecting only darkness
Disrupted visions and closed off hearts
We've turned our face away
From those we're sent to love

But now I hear your voice
Calling me back home
It isn't over yet
Bringing hope into our hopelessness
Turning hearts from stone to flesh

In a world headed for self destruction
The answer is here
Are we too blind to see it?
In a world headed for self destruction, t
He answer is here
Are we too blind to see it?"
