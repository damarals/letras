Father, blessed Father,
It's morning again.
I give you, Father, myself, Father,
Continue Your plan.

I know together we can climb mountains in the sky.
No one can stop us when I'm standing by your side.

Trouble's knocking here again;
I'll tell him Jesus has me by His hand.
He'll walk me through.

Father, loving Father,
Create in me
A pure love, Father, your love, Father,
Instill it in me.

I remember the nights I've cried for you;
Now I only have to die for you;
Thank you, Lord, you've made it clear just for me.

I see the light;
It's burning out the night.

Oh, Father,
It's morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
