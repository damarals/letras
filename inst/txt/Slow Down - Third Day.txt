"1" "Slow Down
Third Day

Tell me to slow down
If you think that the road that I'm on is going
nowhere
Tell me to slow down
If you know that I'm going too fast for my own good
Tell me to slow down
If the way is leading to a dead end
Tell me to slow down
Turn around, let me change the way I'm going

Oh, I don't want to let go
Of all the things that I know
Are keeping me away from my life
Oh, I don't want to slow down
No, I don't want to look around
But I can't seem to work it out
So help me, God

Tell me to slow down
If you see that I'm running too fast in the wrong
race
Tell me to slow down
If you think that I can't keep up with my own pace
Tell me to slow down
?Cause you know if there's ever any question
Tell me slow down
Turn around, and I'm changing my direction"
