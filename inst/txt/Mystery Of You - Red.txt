"1" "Mystery Of You
Red

You always said we'd meet again
You always said you'd be here

You touch the deepest part of me
The places I could not save
Just tell me why I?m so dark inside

Somewhere, I will find
All the pieces torn apart, you just left behind
In your mystery

Somewhere I will see
All you taken from me
All you kept deep inside

In the mystery of you!
The mystery of you!

It?s obvious you understand the blood that on my
hands
I?m paralyzed, I can?t escape
Until I see your face
You?re all I know

Somewhere, I will find
All the pieces torn apart, you just left behind
In your mystery

Somewhere I will see
All you taken from me
All you kept deep inside

In the mystery of you!
The mystery of you!

You?re all I know
You?re all I know oh, oh, oh

Don?t go oh, oh, oh
Don?t go oh, oh, oh

Somewhere, I will find
All the pieces torn apart, you filled me deep inside
The mystery of you

Somewhere
Somewhere
They mysteries of you
Somewhere"
