"1" "Hit Me Like a Bomb
Third Day

You hit me like a bomb
And everything i'm use to
Is suddenly gone
Sorry to acuse you

Do you know what you've done
When you hit me like a boombb

Hear the sound of the sirens ringing
See the world of life that's changing
Well ya hit me like a bomb
I was scared and I started running
Can't say I ever saw it coming
When ya hit me like a bomb

You hit me like a bomb
Everything's changing
It didn't take long
For you to start rearranging

Everything that I've known
When you hit me like a bomb

Hear the sound of the sirens ringing
See the world of life that's changing
Well ya hit me like a bomb
I was scared and I started running
Can't say I ever saw it coming
When ya hit me like a bomb

You hit me like a bomb
And I saw it coming
Hit me like a bomb
And it's all my fault
You hit me like a bomb
And I saw it coming
Hit me like a bomb
And it's all my fault

Hear the sound of the sirens ringing
See the world of life that's changing
Well ya hit me like a bomb
I was scared and I started running
Can't say I ever saw it coming
When ya hit me like a bomb"
