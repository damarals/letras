"1" "We Serve A Mighty God
The Edwin Hawkins Singers

Chorus:
We serve a mighty God,
there’s nothing He can’t solve.
He’s done so much for me,
I cannot tell it all.

If you have tried the rest,,
come on and try the best;
we serve a mighty God, a mighty God.

Verse:
When I look all around me,
confusion is every where,
this world is in a terrible state,
oh they need a Savior.

One day I met a man named Jesus,
He calms even the roughest sea,
what’s He’s done for me, I know He’ll do for you,
‘cause He’s a mighty, mighty, awesome God,
we serve…

Chorus

Verse

Vamp:
We serve a Mighty God.
We serve a Mighty God.
We serve a Mighty God.

What a Mighty God we serve.

We serve a Mighty God, a Mighty God
(repeat as directed)

We serve a Mighty God

What a mighty God we serve."
