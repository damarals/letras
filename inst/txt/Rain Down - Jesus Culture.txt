Jesus Culture

Looks like tonight
The sky is heavy
Feels like the winds
Are gonna change
Beneath my feet
The earth is ready
I know it's time
For heaven's rain
It's gonna rain, yeah

'Cause it's living water we desire
To flood our hearts with holy fire

Rain down
All around the world we're singing
Rain down
Can you hear the earth is singing
Rain down
Some are dry but I'm still singing
Rain down
Rain it down on me

Looks like tonight
(...)

'Cause it's living water we desire
To flood our hearts with holy fire

Rain down
(...)

Back to the start
My heart is heavy
Feels like it's time
To dream again
And I see the clouds
And yes I'm ready
To dance upon
This barren land
Open my hands, yeah

'Cause it's living water we desire
To flood our hearts with holy fire

Rain down
(...)

Do not shut (3x)
The heavens
But open up (3x)
My heart

Rain down
(...)
(2x)"
