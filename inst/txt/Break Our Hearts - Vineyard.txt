"1" "Break Our Hearts
Vineyard

Teach us oh Lord what it really means,
To rend our hearts instead of outer things
And teach us oh God what we do not see
About our hearts and of your ways

And Father deal with our carnal desires
To move in your power but not live the life
And to love our neighbor
With all that we have
And keep our tongues from saying things
We have not seen

Oh break our hearts with the things that break yours
If we sow in tears we will reap in joy
That we might pass through your refining fire
Where brokeness awaits on the other side

But there will be a day
When the nations will bow
And our Lord will be King over all the earth
And He will be the only one
And also His name will be the only one

Raise up an army like Joel saw
Your church that is stronger
Than ever before
They do not break ranks
As they plunge through defenses
But the fear of the Lord will be their wisdom

That they might weep as Jesus wept
A fountain of tears for the wounded and lost
Who ever heard of an army of God
That conquered the earth
By weeping and mourning and brokeness?"
