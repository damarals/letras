"1" "I'm With You
Amy Grant

Love is a hurricane in a blue sky
I didn't see it coming, never knew why
All the laughter and the dreams
All the memories in between
Washed away in a steady stream

Love is a hunger; a famine in your soul
I thought i planted beauty, but it would never grow.
Now i'm on my hands and knees
Trying to gather up my dreams
Trying to hold on to anything

And we could shake a fist in times like this
When we don't understand
Or we could just hold hands

You and me, me and you
Where you go i'll go too
I'm with you, i'm with you
Until your heart, finds a home
I won't let you feel alone
I'm with you, i'm with you, with you

You do your best to build a higher wall
To keep love safe from any wrecking ball
When the dust has cleared, we will
See the house that love rebuilds
Guarding beauty that lives here still

It's you and me, me and you
Where you go i'll go too
I'm with you, i'm with you
Until your heart, finds a home
I won't let you feel alone
I'm with you, i'm with you

Who can say i'm left with nothing
When i have all of you, all of you, yeah
In the way you've always loved me
I remember. he does too

You and me, me and you
Where you go i'll go too
I'm with you, i'm with you
Until your heart, finds a home
I won't let you feel alone
I'm with you, i'm with you
(we're gonna make it through)

You and me, me and you
Where you go i'll go too
I'm with you, i'm with you
Until your heart, finds a home
I won't let you feel alone
I'm with you, i'm with you

With you"
