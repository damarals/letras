"1" "Let It Start In Me
Gaither Vocal Band

There's a dawn arising on a brand new day
There's a strong wind stirring 'cross the ancient graves
There's a voice that's calling 'will you be set free? '
There's a change a coming
Let it start in me

Let it start in me
Let it start in me
There's a change a coming
Let it start in me
There's a fire that's burning sweeping 'cross this land
There's a heat consuming every evil plan
There is gold emerging from refining flame
There's a diamond sparkling
Where there once was shame

There's a revolution cavaliering o'er the sea
We all know it's coming people must be free
Feel the tides feel the tides a changing
Hear the waves roll in
Let this revolution wash away our sin
Let it start in me
Let it start in me
There's a change a coming
Let it start in me

There's a storm a brewing
There's the sound of rain
When the thunder's rumbling 'cross the thirsty plain
Let the drought be over
If we just believe that the rains are coming
Let it rain on me
Let it start, let it start in me
Amen"
