"x"
"1" "Silence Me
Jeremy Camp

the many worlds i speak i turn around them all
(i turn them all)
talking about myself and all the things i need
i need to be pacient and listen to your voice
help me to know you, help me to hear.

silence me so i can hear you
open up my ears so i can hear you

help my actions speak louder than my words
to live my life out loud about the love between you and me
(between you and me)
i need to be ? and i konw that you are guide
help me to know you, help me to hear.

silence me so i can hear you
open up my ears so i can hear you.

silence me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
