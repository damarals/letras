Who will I be
When trouble comes callin' for me?
While I live the way I believe
When I'm backed up against the wall?

What kind of heart do I have in my chest?
Does it beat for my Savior, or just for my flesh?
What will I do in the moment that everything falls?

I'm gonna stand in a world that's breaking
Stand for a truth unchangin'
I'm not ashamed, I've considered the cost
I'll stand right here at the foot of the cross
And stand

They can call me a fool
Or stubborn for following You
For trusting without any proof
But I've seen You here through it all

So what kind of person do I wanna be?
Am I committed to You or committеd to me?
What will I choose the sеcond that everything falls?

I'm gonna stand in a world that's breaking
Stand for a truth unchangin'
I'm not ashamed, I've considered the cost
I'll stand right here at the foot of the cross
And stand (Stand)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Stand (Stand)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm not ashamed, I've considered the cost
I'll stand right here at the foot of the cross

And stand up for the One who gave everything
Stand up because You deserve all of me
I won't give up, I won't give in
And if it takes all I am

I'm gonna stand in a world that's breaking (Oh)
Stand for a truth unchangin'
I'm not ashamed, I've considered the cost
I'll stand right here at the foot of the cross (Oh-oh)
And stand (Stand)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Jesus, help me
Stand (Stand)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm not ashamed, I've considered the cost (Not ashamed)
I'll stand right here at the foot of the cross (Oh, oh)
And stand"
