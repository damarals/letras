"1" "Harmony
Take 6

In a symphony there's unity all the sounds agree
From the violin to the timpani all the parts play the same melody
Chords of sound timbres resound all arround there's harmony

Chorus:
Join the band sing in harmony
Take a stand fight for unity
Strike a chord hear the harmony
One accord one family

From a different place background or race various styles and tastes
But when I love you and you love me
Hand in hand that's the way it should be
Can't we see we could be free why can't the world live in harmony

Chorus

I'll hold you up never let you down
If we can work together that's harmony
So let's get along everyone sing the same song
No need to fight no right or wrong

Alt. Chorus:
(Come on) join the band and sing in harmony
Take a stand fight for unity
Black and white together we can face all kinds of weather
No storm can sever when we're one family

Alt. Chorus

Rap:
There's so many flavors in the world
Then you gotta let'em flow, and spread
A little love so they have a chance to grow
And spread more love to the brother
Who's adjacent to another brother of another color, yo!
Don't ya know there's nothin' we can't do
If you stand for me and I stand for you
Cease the perpetuation of hatred in our nation
And star improving our relations
Latifah in the mix with Take 6
Extending the lease on peace, with patience
Hailing the harmony, you arm in arm with me
Showing unity from Kansas to Carnesie
I believe I believe it can be done
But it can't be done unless we can be one
So let the sun shine in friend
Before you reach your end-ing

Alt. Chorus
