Take 6

I can’t imagine life without ever meeting you.

And I’m often wondering what would I ever do.

I may have fallen into some ordinary love

With an ordinary life

That was never quite enough.



So let the river of our time take us away

And beyond, let our love guide us all the way

For without you, there’d be no color in my life

Don’t let go now, your love’s what I believe

Through it all I'll understand

Hold on, I’m here for you

I’d give my life to loving you

You are all I see



Now if you ever choose to take you love away

I can’t imagine how I could see another day

Now, I know I can’t exist on the empty promises

And I know I can not live on a few good memories

(chorus)"
