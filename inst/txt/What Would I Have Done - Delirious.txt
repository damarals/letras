"1" "What Would I Have Done?
Delirious

What can you do with a heavy soul?
When you can dance but there's no rock 'n' roll
Where can you go, if the sun doesn't shine?
You sing the words, but none of them rhyme
What would I have done if it wasn't for Jesus?
Where do you go when you've lost the keys
When all is dark and you're on your knees?
And in a world where its love betrays
There is a light that will save the day
Don't go away
What would I have done if it wasn't for Jesus?
What would I have done if it wasn't for Jesus?
What would I have become if it wasn't for Jesus?
What would I have done?
What would I have done?

What would I have done if it wasn't for you"
