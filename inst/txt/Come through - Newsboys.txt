Newsboys

You're like the storm on a desert plain
When the rivers dried up and no one's calling for rain
And I'm standing arms held high as the water hits my face

You're like a storm on a desert plain
You always come through
You have not forsaken me
You are working all things for my good even when I cannot see
I know You always come through for me

You're like the break of the morning light
Every day I wake to the promise that hope is alive
You give me what I need to know everything's alright
You're like the break of the morning light I know

Cause I know You always come through
You have not forsaken me
You are working all things for my good even when I cannot see
I know You always come through for me
I can't wait just to see what You're gonna do
God I know You're the King of the breakthrough

In every trial every fire I can trust You
You're the hope, You're the promise I cling to
I know You always come through
You have not forsaken me
You are working all things for my good even when I cannot see
I know You always come through for me

Come on, come on, come on
God I know You're gonna come through
Come on, come on, come on
God I know You're gonna come through
Come on, come on, come on
God I know You're gonna come through
Come on, come on, come on
God I know You're gonna come through"
