"1" "Daylight To Break
Switchfoot

I've seen the darkest things
Crawling inside of me
I've seen the monsters come alive
I've seen the enemy
The nightmare follows me
Searching the darkness for a light

Waiting for daylight to break up this room
Waiting for daylight to break
I've been alone in the dark
I've been dreaming now
Waking up without you
I've been waking up without you for too long

Back in the tragedy
I've made a mess of me
My bitter means, my bitter ends, yeaa
I've seen the irony
It gets the best of me
Dying to be made new again, again

Waiting for daylight to break up this room
Waiting for daylight to break
I've been alone in the dark
I've been dreaming the day
when dreamers are awake

The sun hits my eyes and everything is right
I've been waking up without you
I've been waking up without you
*I've been warring alarms 'til you were in my arms
I've been waking up without you
I've been waking up without you for too long

Waiting for daylight to break up this room
Waiting, waiting
I've been alone in the dark
I've been dreaming the day
when dreamers are awake

The sun hits my eyes and everything is right
I've been waking up without you
I've been waking up without you
I've been warring alarms til you were in my arms
I've been waking up without you
I've been waking up without you for too long"
