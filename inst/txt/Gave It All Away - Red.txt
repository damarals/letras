"1" "Gave It All Away
Red

You're here
Trembling with fear
You've made it clear
You turned your back
And now you've gone astray
Nothing left to say
What's standing in your way
You had the chance to
Never walk alone

But you gave it all away
When I needed you to stay
Just open up your arms
I need you here
I can't do this on my own
I've got nothing left to show
Open up your arms
I need you here

Again
Lying in your bed
Nightmares in your head
Facing all that you just threw away
At the edge again
It's coming to an end
You had the chance to
Never walk alone

Here, here
I need you
Here, here

But you gave it all away
When I needed you to stay
Just open up your arms
I need you here
I can't do this on my own
I've got nothing left to show
Open up your arms
I need you here"
