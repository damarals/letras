Catedral

Thats the meaning of my tenderless
thats the feeling of my success
you're my incomparable love
theres no limit of my hopeness
that’s my silence and I confess
you’re my incomparable love”


Love will be carry you
And this is the way I do
My heart will fly and follow you
In deepest loneliness

Love can move everything
Collors in everywhere
My dream blow up when I saw you
I Know that you care me too"
