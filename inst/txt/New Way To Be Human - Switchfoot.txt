"1" "New Way To Be Human
Switchfoot

Everyday it’s the same thing
Another trend has begun
Hey kids, this might be the one
It’s a race to be noticed
And it’s leaving us numb
Hey kids, we can’t be the ones
With all of our fashion
We’re still incomplete
The God of redemption
Could break our routine

There’s a new way to be human
It’s nothing we’ve ever been
There’s a new way to be human
New way to be human

And where is our inspiration?
When all the heroes are gone
Hey kids, could we be the ones?
‘Cause nobody’s famous
And nobody’s fine
We all need forgiveness
We’re longing inside

There’s a new way to be human
It’s nothing we’ve ever been
There’s a new way to be human
It’s spreadin’ under my skin
There’s a new way to be human
Where divinity blends
With a new way to be human
New way to be human

You’re throwing your love across
My impossible space
You’ve created me
Take me out of me into...

A new way to be human
To a new way to be human
You’re a new way to be human
Where my humanity blends
To a new way to be human
Redemption begins
You’re a new way to be human
You’re a new way to be human
You’re the only way to be human
You’re a new way to be human
