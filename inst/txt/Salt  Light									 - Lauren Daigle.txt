"1" "Salt & Light									
Lauren Daigle

Oh the beauty of the king
You make righteous those who seek
You have written and redeemed my story

Let my eyes see your kingdom shine all around
Let my heart overflow with passion for your name
Let my life be a song, revealing who you are
For you are salt & light

Oh the love that set me free
You bring hope to those in need
You have written and redeemed my story

For you are salt & light
You are loves great height
You are deep and wide
A consuming fire"
