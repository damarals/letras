"1" "The Crucible For Silver
Delirious

The crucible for silver
And the furnace for gold,
But the Lord tests the heart of this child,
Standing in all purity
God, our passion is for holiness,
Lead us to the secret place of praise.

Jesus, holy one
You are my hearts desire,
King of kings, my everything
You've set this heart on fire. x2

Father take our offering,
With our song we humbly praise you,
You have brought your holy fire to our lips.
Standing in your beauty Lord
Your gift to us is holiness,
Lead us to the place where we can sing."
