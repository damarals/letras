"1" "More Than Anything
Hillsong United

VERSE 1:
You were with us from the start, our every moment
Though we fell apart, You chose to love us
Never let it go, You sent Your son for us

VERSE 2:
You Came into the world, with one desire
to lead us from our sin, remove our failures
So we could meet with You, and know ourselves as Yours

PRE CHORUS:
In the world that tries to find a way in itself
searching high and low, and looking for meaning
we will hold to what we know as truth, know as love
Life is found
when we give ourselves up to You, Lord

CHORUS:
Give it all, Give it all
To the one whose life (3x)
Saved my life ..

VERSE 3:
Future in Your hands, our lives have purpose
Sins now erased, and now I can't hide it
Never lookin' back, we know ourselves as Yours

PRE CHORUS:
In the world that tries to find a way in itself
searching high and low, and looking for meaning
we will hold to what we know as truth, know as love
Life is found
when we give ourselves up to You, Lord

CHORUS:
Give it all, Give it all
To the one whose life (3x)
Saved my life ..

BRIDGE:
This we know, we have a new life
We are Yours now and forever, in this life all that we seek
To be with You, more than anything (5x)"
