chorus:
Reign, Most High
Almighty Reign, Most High
Almighty I, Most High
What good is for a man to gain the whole world
Yet lose of forfeit his very self?
He must deny himself and
Take up his cross daily and follow me
If anyone is ashamed of me and my words,
Then I will be ashamed of him
When the time comes, in his glory, we will rise

chorus

I tell you the truth, some of you who are standing here
Will not taste death before they see jah
Creation come with his power
What can a man give in exchange for his own
Soul he cannot save?
When the time comes, in his Glory, we will rise

chorus

When the time comes, in his Glory, we will rise
