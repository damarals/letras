"x"
"1" "Spirit Thing
Newsboys

It's not a family trait,
it's nothing that I ate,
and it didn't come from skating with Holy Rollers,

It's an early warning sign,
it keeps my life in line,
but it's so hard to define,
Nevermind...

(Chorus)
It's just a spirit thing,
it's just a holy nudge,
it's like a circuit judge in the brain.
It's just a spirit thing,
it's here to guard my heart,
it's just a little hard to explain.

It pushes when i quit,
it smells a counterfit,
Sometimes it works a bit like a teleprompter...

When it's telepromting you,
I pray you'll let it through,
And I'll help you with the how,
But for now...

(Chorus)

I took the long way,
bent back down again,
Some things will never
ever be explained.
no they can not be explained...
yeah

(Chorus) x3
