"1" "Lights Shine Bright
Toby Mac

Lights shine bright, everywhere we go
Music for the people, making music for the people
Lights shine bright, everywhere we go
Lights shine bright, everywhere we go
Everywhere we go, music for the people
Making music for the people

I wanna magnify your light
I wanna reflect the son
Cut like precious diamonds
With colors by the million

This is the only world we know
And for now this rental's our home
If we gon' be a reflection
Gotta make this stand rock glow
Just so you know

Light shine bright, everywhere we go
Music for the people to illuminate the soul
Lights shine bright, everywhere we go
Music for the people, making music for the people
Light shine bright, everywhere we go
Music for the people to illuminate the soul
Lights shine bright, everywhere we go
Music for the people, Jesus music for the people
Everywhere go
Light shine bright, light shine bright
Everywhere we go
Light shine bright, light shine bright

Lights in the city might be more than pretty, pretty
That freaky shine might be more than meets the eye
Anytime you see that sparkle in the dark you might look deeper, deeper
It might be more than simply theatre

Yo, that smile might be joy that's connected to the spirit
The spirit might be contagious if you dare, you dare come near it
I remember, can't forget, peace that you can't second guess
Sparkle as the light reflects we writin' pay it forward checks

The lights in the city shine bright
The lights in the city shine bright
So let your heart light shine tonight"
