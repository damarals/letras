Verse 1
Look what we can do
When we get together
And give support
To those on the lines

Verse 2
It's our sons and daughters
Our sisters and brothers
Let's show them we cared
If they lived or died

Chorus
In this land of freedom
There's riots in the streets
All in the name of peace
If we stand in unity
We'll win with dignity
Our strength has said it all
Pray and believe

Verse 3
The wars through the ages
Have taken so many lives
I think of their faces
And the fear in their eyes

Verse 4
With hearts made of courage
And souls filled with fire
Those who fight for their freedom
Let's lift their names higher

Repeat Chorus
"
