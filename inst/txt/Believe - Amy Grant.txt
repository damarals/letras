Amy Grant

Would you think that I was crazy
If I said to you
I know a way that love can make
your wildest dreams come true
And all you have to do
Is

Believe
Miracles can happen
Just imagine
And believe
Open up your heart
The journey starts
When you believe

When you had enough
And givin' up has all but got you down
You sure could stand a helpin' hand
Get your feet back on the ground
Turn your world around
And

Believe
Miracles can happen
Just imagine
And believe
Open up your heart
The journey starts
When you believe

When your pride is tryin' to tell you
To do it by yourself
And you're running out of answers
And you need a little help

Believe
Miracles can happen
Just imagine
And believe
Open up your heart
The journey starts
When you believe

(If only you)
Just believe"
