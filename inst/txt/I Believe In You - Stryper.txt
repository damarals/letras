"1" "I Believe In You
Stryper

Time seems to pass me by
I found myself alone, wondering why
You came into my life
And gave your love to me
You are the one
To show me the way
In my heart, you'll stay

And I believe in you
Whoa through and through
Always and forever, it will be
You and me, together

I want your love, forever
I need your love
You're the only one that fills my heart
And I love you, more and more every day

I believe in you
Whoa, through and through
Always and forever, it will be
You and me

I will sing to you
And all you do
Always and forever, it will be
You and me, together
