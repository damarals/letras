"1" "Step Inside, the Violence
Red

[Verse 1]
Separation (breaking, breaking)
Splitting me inside
Masquerading (masquerade)
I see the monster behind
Suffocate (it chokes) the life away
I choke on your lies
I'll descend, I'll burn the embers
Now I can rise
The war is just beginning

[Chorus]
Step inside, step inside
(Step inside, the violence)
Step inside, step inside
(Step inside, the violence)

[Verse 2]
Complicated lost inside a maze
Fatal friend I say goodbye again
Abdicate abdicate another throne
I ascend, I, I ascend, I

[Chorus]
Step inside, step inside
(Step inside, the violence)
Step inside, step inside
(Step inside, the violence)
(Step inside, the violence)
(Step inside, the violence)

[Bridge]
Step inside, the violence
Step inside, the violence
I'll never let go
Give you control now
Obey
You are alone now

[Chorus]
Step inside, step inside
(Step inside, the violence)
Step inside, step inside
(Step inside, the violence)"
