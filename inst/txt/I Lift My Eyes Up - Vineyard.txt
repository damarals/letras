"1" "I Lift My Eyes Up
Vineyard

I lift my eyes up to the mountains
Where does my help come from
My help comes from You
Maker of heaven, creator of the earth

Chorus:
Oh how I need You Lord
You are my only hope
Youâ€™re my only prayer
So I will wait for You
To come and rescue me
Come and give me life"
