"1" "The Altar
Kirk Franklin

At the altar
You can tell
Jesus
All about it

At the altar
you can tell
what you heart has to say

You can tell Him
How need Him
How thank Him
And how you love Him

At the altar
When you kneel
To pray

So if your journey through life has been bittersweet
And the courage to dream has turned incomplete
At the altar your brokenness He will meet
There's joy in knowing He's near
[Repeat]

At the altar
You can tell
Jesus
All about it

At the altar
you can tell
what you heart has to say

You can tell Him
How need Him
How thank Him
And how you love Him

At the altar
When you kneel
To pray

Down down down
At the altar
Down down down
At the altar"
