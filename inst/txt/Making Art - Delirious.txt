"1" "Making Art
Delirious

Just like a tambourine,
I am making art.
Just like a beauty queen,
I am making art.

All around the world,
All around the world.
I can't fake it,
I just make it.
All around the world.

Just like Johnny Cash,
I am making art.
Just like balderdash,
I am making art.

All around the world,
All around the world.
I can't make it,
I just fake it.
All around the world."
