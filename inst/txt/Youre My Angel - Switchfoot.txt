"1" "You're My Angel
Switchfoot

Looking into to your eyes I see all I want to be
And i don't want it to end
If i could only put two words in the way I see you
I only know i have an angel with me now

When i fall asleep you´re all that i see
You read my thoughts and all of my prayers
I wish i could meant all that you meant to me

I wish you could see all that you meant to me
But I can never find the words to tell you

When I fall asleep you´re all that i see
You read my thoughts and all of my prayers
I wish I could meant all that you meant to me
My angel without wings"
