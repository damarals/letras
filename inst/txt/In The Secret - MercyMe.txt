"1" "In The Secret
MercyMe

In the secret,
In the quiet place
in the stillness you are there
In the secret in the quite hour I wait
Only for you
'Cause I want to know you more

Chorus
I want to know you
I want to hear your voice
I want to know you more
I want to touch you
I want to see you face
I want to know you more

I am reaching for the highest goal
That I might recive the prize
Pressing onward
Pushing every hinderance aside
Out of my way
Cause i want to know you more

Chorus x2

in the secret in the quite place
in the stillness you are there

Chorus x2"
