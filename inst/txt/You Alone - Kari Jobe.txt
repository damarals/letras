"1" "You Alone
Kari Jobe

You alone, oh god, are gracious
Gave your life to freely save us
You alone are god, we fear your name
You alone are full of mercy
Grace and truth you've given freely
You alone are god, and you are good

You came and died, were bruised and tried
And left to die upon the cross
You gave it all to give us life
And grace untold to make us whole"
