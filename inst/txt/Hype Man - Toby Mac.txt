Tru D-O-G make it hot for we,
Tru D-O-G make it hot...

[Tru Dog]
Like this? Tru D-O-G that's who I am,
With the sun in my eyes and the mic in my hand,
I'm gonna rock this party like an old school jam,
Tru D-O-G, that's what I got Pops

[tobyMac]
Nice, Tru D-O-G what you got for me,
Tru D-O-G what you got boy,
Tru D-O-G make it hot for we,
Tru D-O-G make it hot boy,

[Tru Dog]
I got to get this off my chest I like recess,
And I like it the best when I'm ballin',
Shot-calling, bouncing off the walls,

[tobyMac]
What you know about shot-calling man,
Cause everybody gonna move when I rock the mic,
I ke...

[Tru Dog]
Yo hold up dad,
Don't you have 11 otha joints on this record?

[tobyMac]

[Tru Dog]
What's the name of this track anyway,

[tobyMac]
Tru Dog...

[Tru Dog]
Cause everybody gonna move when I rock the mic,
I keep it lyrically smooth like I'm riding a bike,
And everyonce in awhile just to see if they feel me,
I'm gonna pop a wheelie!
Uh
I'm gonna pop a wheelie!

[tobyMac]
Man what you talkin' about?
You can't pop no wheelie.

[Tru Dog]
Yes I can!
Ask momma.

[tobyMac]
Hold on, you said something about old school,
whatcha know about old school.

[Tru Dog]
Check this,
Shake it, don't break it,
It took your momma nine months to make it.

[tobyMac]
This tracks getting out of control.

[Tru Dog]
But Dad!
