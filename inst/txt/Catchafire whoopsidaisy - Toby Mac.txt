Toby Mac

Slackin’ off like a bum, I’m feelin’ ho hum
I’m feelin’ luke warm like the water in my tub
Started out and we was hot, looked up and now we’re not
We had that fire like we was boilin’ in a pot

Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

Fire, I’m feenin’ for a flicker
Then we’ll fan the flame up into something bigger
Started out and we was hot, looked up and now we’re not
We gonna catch a fire, catch a fire for God

Whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that
Whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

Fire, takin’ it from warm to hot
Fire, gotta give it all we got
Fire, whoopsi-daisy, call me crazy, whoopsi-daisy
Come, we gonna catch that

Spark to a flame, I’m flippin’ up my game
I caught the fire and I’ll never be the same
So unexplainable I can’t contain it, son
And my retaining it would only be a shame
So let me hear you say

Heat, like the Kingston concrete
There ain’t no stoppin’ the fire
We’re straight breakin’ ground
There ain’t no cooling this thing down
We burnin’ up and keep’n it krunk as we know how
Hear me now people

Catch a fire let it burn within
Catch a fire let it burn for him"
