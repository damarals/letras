"1" "After You
Britt Nicole

I've been honest with all
That I've been through
I've been running after everything but you
And I'll be honest: nothing satisfies
Like the love I find inside your eyes

There's nothing sweeter than your love
It's all I want, it's all I need
There's nothing sweeter than your love
You gave it all, poured out for me

So I'm not after the world
I'm after you
So I'm not after the world
I'm after you

You were watching
Waiting all this time
While I was searching
For something in this life
But there's nothing here that I could find
Like the love I find inside your eyes

Cause nothing's sweeter than your love
It's all I want, it's all I need
There's nothing sweeter than your love
You gave it all, poured out for me

So I'm not after the world
I'm after you
So I'm not after the world
I'm after you

I'm not runnin' after the world
I'm runnin' after you
So I'm not after the world
I'm only after you

Nothing's sweeter than your love
It's all I want, it's all I need
There's nothing sweeter than your love
You gave it all, poured out for me

Cause nothing's sweeter than your love
It's all I want, it's all I need
There's nothing sweeter than your love
You gave it all, poured out for me

So I'm not after the world
I'm not after the world
I'm after you

So I'm not after the world
I'm not after the world
I'm after you"
