Newsboys

God of all nations
Lord of creation
It's in the bonds of love we meet
We come together at Your feet
Equal in Your sight
Made one by Your might
You've called us to restore Your lands
And place them back within Your hands

Chorus:
So tonight
Be glorified
Be magnified
As every nation lifts You high
Oh, Father tonight
It's our desire
To see Your Kingdom shine
On earth as in Heaven tonight

God of all nations
Lord of creation
Your purpose is out hope, our bread
All You've planned and all You've said
Lord of the heavens
Lord of the ages
The church You build shall never fail
No gate or border will prevail

Chorus

Tonight
Be glorified
Lifted up high
It's our desire

So tonight
Be glorified
Lifted up high
It's our desire

Oh, Father, tonight
It's our desire
You're magnified
Lifted up high

Chrous

Oh be glorified"
