"1" "The Power And The Glory
Hillsong United

This grace is mine, this glory, earthbound heaven sent
This plan divine, this life this light that breaks my night
The Spirit of God, Heaven falls like a dove to my heart.


Verse 2:
This love is mine, so undeserved, this glorious name
This Son, this God, this life, this death, this victory won.
Forgiveness has flowed as this grace
that is mine fills my heart

Chorus:
The power and the glory of Your name
The power and the glory of Your name
The power and the glory of Your name,
The name of the Lord, the Son of God.


Verse 3:
This life is mine, so perfect and so pure, this God in me,
This glorious hope from earth to heaven, death to life.
This future assured and secured by this love in my heart.
