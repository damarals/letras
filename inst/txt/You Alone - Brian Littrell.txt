"1" "You Alone
Brian Littrell

Great and marvelous are Your deeds
Lord, God Almighty
Just and true are Your ways
King of the ages

Who will not fear You, Oh Lord
And bring glory to Your name

For You alone are holy
All nations will bow down and worship
You alone are Holy
All nations will bow down in worship before You

I sought the Lord and He answered me
And delivered me from all of my fears
Those who look to Him are radiant with joy
And their faces will never be ashamed

Who will not fear You, Oh Lord
And bring glory to Your name

For You alone are holy
All nations will bow down and worship
You alone are Holy
All nations will bow down in worship before You"
