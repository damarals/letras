"1" "You Reign
MercyMe

Even before there was a drop in the ocean
Even before there was a star in the sky
Even before the world was put in motion
You were on Your throne
You were on Your throne

(Chorus)
You reign
Glory in the highest
You reign
Let creation testify
By Your name
Every knee will bow
And every tongue proclaim
That Jesus reigns

(Verse 2)
Even before Your hand made the heavens
Even before the breath of all mankind
Even before we had to be forgiven
You were on Your throne
You were on Your throne

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Yesterday, today and forever
You are God who was, and is and is to come

(Chorus)"
