"1" "Lift Up Your Face
Third Day

Lift up your face, lift up your face
Salvation is calling, salvation is calling

You have fallen so far now
You don’t even know how, you are going to survive
(But) Just above the horizon
A new light is shining, breaking through the darkest night
Love is coming and it’s calling out your name

Lift up your face, lift up your face
Salvation is calling, salvation is calling

Lift up your face, lift up your face
Salvation is calling, salvation is calling your name

You feel like your life is fading
You’re tired of waiting, for your moment to arrive
But tomorrow will bring a song that you can sing
And your hope is gonna rise
Love is coming and it’s calling out your name

Lift up your face, lift up your face
Salvation is calling, salvation is calling

Lift up your face, lift up your face
Salvation is calling, salvation is calling your name

Oh yeah…
Do you hear Him calling?
Can you hear Him calling?
He’s calling out your name
He’s calling out your name

Lift up your face, lift up your face
Salvation is calling, salvation is calling

Lift up your face, lift up your face
Salvation is calling, salvation is calling your name

Can you hear Him calling?
Can you hear Him calling now?
Oh, can you hear Him calling you
He is calling you now
He is calling out your name

Just above the horizon
A new light is shining
Salvation’s on its way"
