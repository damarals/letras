"1" "Sanctified
MercyMe

Let there be no condemnation
For all who are fully known in Christ
Unspeakable grace for all the nations
By way of holy sacrifice

We worship with the sound
Of broken shackles
Falling to the ground

Chorus
Sanctified
I have been set free
Grace divine
Has swept me off my feet

No greater love has ever been known
Than He who came to find the lost
No greater sacrifice has been shown
Than He who laid upon the cross

Let all creation sing
For He has come
And Heâ€™s changed everything

Chorus

Bridge
And I know that I will never be the same

Chorus"
