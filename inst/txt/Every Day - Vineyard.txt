"1" "Every Day
Vineyard

I take another clumsy step
I stumble over what I have said
I reach out my trembling hand
Afraid that You won't return the gesture

I am tempted in every way
To ask You to turn the light from me
'Cause the more I undress my soul
Before You I fear that I'll be rejected

But now I see I'm more complete
Every day that I can't live without You
And now I feel I'm more complete
Every day that I can't live without You"
