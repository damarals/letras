"1" "Grace Of My Life
Brian Littrell

I lie awake so often at night
With something to read and something to write
In the silence my mind is free
To think of the ways that God has blessed me
Its easy to see how he's been so kind
Any proof I might need is right here by my side

You are the grace of my life
So tender, so undeserved
Hard to believe you're my wife
Even harder to put what I feel into words
If I need evidence God is good
Just looking at you is enough
You are the grace of my life
For you grace my life with your love

Love that is pure, so faithful and strong
You forgive me when I do you wrong
Seeing you, yeah, time after time
A picture on Earth, a love so divine
Oh I am amazed for how can it be
Someone like you would love someone like me?

You are the grace of my life
So tender, so undeserved
Hard to believe you're my wife
Even harder to put what I feel into words
If I need evidence God is good
Just looking at you is enough
You are the grace of my life
For you grace my life with your love

Oh you are the grace of my life
for you grace my life with your love
