"1" "Light Of The World
Jesus Culture

Love came down
In flesh He walked among us
Bore our sins
Through death He rose victorious
Bursting from the grave He rose glorious

Light of the world even death could not contain
Darkness fell, it was defeated on that day

Perfect Light
Shining down upon us
We are free
In Him we are victorious

Light of the world even death could not contain
Darkness fell, it was defeated on that day
He is alive. He has risen from the grave
All our sins are washed away

He pulled us from the depths of darkness
Brought us into glorious light
He broke the power of sin and freed us
Gave us life

He pulled us from the depths of darkness
Brought us into glorious light
He broke the power of sin and freed us
Gave us life

Light of the world even death could not contain
Darkness fell, it was defeated on that day
He is alive. He has risen from the grave
All our sins are washed away

Light of the world
He is the light
He's the light of the world
He is the light
He is the light"
