Third Day

You Are So Good To Me


You are so good to me
You heal my broken heart
You are my Father in heaven (2x)

You ride upon the clouds
You lead me to the truth
You are the Spirit inside me (2x)

You poured out all your blood
You died upon the cross
You are my Jesus who loves me (2x)

Chorus:
You are beautiful my sweet, sweet, song (3x)
I will sing again

Bridge:
You are my strong melody
You are my dancing rhythm
You are my perfect rhyme
"
