"1" "Lover Of My Soul
Kari Jobe

King of glory come
I surrender all
Hear my sinful soul
I love You Lord, I love You Lord

King of Heaven come
Let Your presence fall
You're saving, You're strong
I love You Lord, I love You Lord

Jesus, all my heart belongs, to You
Jesus, every heartbeat longs, for You

Oh lover of my soul
Pull me in Your arms forever
It's You and You alone
Burning in my heart
Oh lover of my soul

You're my one true love
Every breath is Yours
Hear my greatest song
I love You Lord, I love You Lord

Jesus, all my heart belongs, to You
Jesus, every heartbeat longs, for You

Oh lover of my soul
Pull me in Your arms forever
It's You and You alone
Burning in my heart
Oh lover of my soul
Keep me in Your arms forever
Oh lover of my soul
I am forever Yours

Fall in this place
Fall in this place
Fall in this place
Fall in this place

Fall in this place (King of glory come)
Fall in this place (King of glory come)
Fall in this place (King of glory come)
Fall in this place

Oh lover of my soul
Pull me in Your arms forever
It's You and You alone
Burning in my heart (my heart, my heart, my heart)
Oh lover of my soul (lover of my soul)
Keep me in Your arms forever
Oh lover of my soul (lover of my soul)
I am forever Yours (I am forever Yours, forever Yours)

Oh lover of my soul"
