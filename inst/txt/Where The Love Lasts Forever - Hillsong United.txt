"1" "Where The Love Lasts Forever
Hillsong United

Your mercy found me
Upon the broken road
And lifted me beyond my failing
Into your glory
My sin and shame dissolved
And now forever yours I'll stand

In love never to end
To call you more than Lord
Glorious friend

So I throw my life upon all that you are
'Cause I know you gave it all for me
And when all else fades
My soul will dance, with you
Where the love lasts forever

And forever I will sing
Lord forever I will sing
Of how you gave your life away
Just to save me Lord you saved me

With you, where the love lasts forever"
