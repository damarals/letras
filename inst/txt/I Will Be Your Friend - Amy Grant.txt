"1" "I Will Be Your Friend
Amy Grant

When every moment gets too hard
The end of the road can feel so far
No matter how much time we're apart
I'm always near you

I'll be the shelter in your rain,
Help you to find your smile again
I'll make you laugh at a broken heart
Wherever you are

(Chorus)
'Cause I'm never gonna walk away
If the walls come down someday
All alone,and you feel afraid
I'll be there when you call my name
You can always depend on me
I believe until forever ends
I will be your friend

So many people come and go
But nothing will change the you I know
You'll never be just a face in the crowd
And time will show

(Chorus)
Through the seasons and the years
I will always hold you dear
Never you fear

(Chorus)

I'll be around when the candle burns down low
And I want you and I want you to know

(Chorus)"
