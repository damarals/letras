"1" "John The Revelator
Gaither Vocal Band

Up on the isle of Patmus
A man was cast one day
As he was left alone to die
He began to pray
The Holy Ghost fell on him
The Spirit, he came down
Well, he began to write about the things he saw
The revelators' name was John
(Talkin' 'bout John)
John the Revelator
He saw Jerusalem comin' down
(Yes, it was John)
John the Revelator
And when he looked around
He saw feet like brass
Eyes like fire
Heard a great voice sayin' \"Come up higher!\"
(It was John)
John the Revelator
He wrote about th
e city of God
While in the spirit prayin'
John turned around to see
If the voice he had heard
Was what it seemed to be
Just like the many waters
A great trumpet sound
Well He said, \"I am the first and last.\"
The revelator wrote it down
(Talkin'
'bout John)
John the Revelator
He saw Jerusalem comin' down
(Yes, it was John)
John the Revelator
And when he looked around
He saw feet like brass
Eyes like fire
Heard a great voice sayin' \"Come up higher!\"
(It was John)
John the Revelator
He w
rote about the city of God
(Repeat last verse twice)"
