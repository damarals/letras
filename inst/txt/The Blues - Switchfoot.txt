"1" "The Blues
Switchfoot

is this the new year
or just another night
is this the new fear
or just another fright
is this the new tear
or just another desperation
is this the finger
or just another fist
is this the kingdom
or just a hit and miss
a misdirection most in all this desperation

is this what they call freedom
is this what you call pain
is this what they call discontented fame
it'll be a day like this one
when the world caves in
when the world caves in
when the world caves in

I'm singin this one like a broken piece of glass
broken hearts and broken noses in the back
is this the new year
or just another desperation
you push until you're shoving
you bend until you break
'til you stand on the broken fields where your fathers lay
it'll be a day like this one when the world caves in
when the world caves in
when the world caves in
when the world caves in
when the world caves in
when the world caves in

is nothing here worth saving
is no one here at all
is there any net left that could break our fall
it'll be a day like this one when the sky falls down
when the hungry and poor and deserted are found
are you discontented
have you been pushing hard
have you been throwing down this broken house of cards
it'll be a day like this one when the world caves in
when the world caves in
when the world caves in

is there nothing left now
nothing left to sing
are there any left who haven't kissed the enemy
is this the new year
or just another desperation
does justice ever find you
do the wicked ever lose
is there any honest song to sing besides these blues
and nothing is okay until the world caves in
until the world caves in
'til the world caves in
'til the world caves in
'til the world caves in
'til the world caves in
'til the world caves in
until the world caves in
until the world caves in
until the world caves in
until the world caves in"
