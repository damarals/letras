"1" "Be My Guide
Vineyard

Be my guide, God of Abraham
Lead me by Your hand
You are strong and wise
I want to trust in You and in all I do
Bring You honour and praise

How I love You
Great and mighty King
You are faithful
Through the ages You never change

Be my guide in the dark of night
Set all fear to flight
You are hope and truth
I want to trust in You and in all I do
Bring you honour and praise

Be my guide for the road ahead
And should I feel misled
You are just and good
I want to trust in You and in all I do
Bring You honour and praise"
