"1" "Can't Take Away
Jeremy Camp

All of my joy, all of my peace, all of my purpose
All of the confidence in knowing that He's working
All of the healing in the middle of the hurting
At the end of the story, all the glory He's deserving

The battle's on, I know that it's for real
But I'm standing on the rock that never shakes
The dark is always gonna try to steal
But I'm not afraid

I put my hope in love that never fades
'Cause what the Lord gives
The world can't take

I hold onto the promise He won't break
'Causе what the Lord gives
The world can't takе away

Give me the strength when I get stuck in all my weakness
Give me the truth when I forget and I can't see it
I'm not gonna buy into the lie that I'm defeated
No, I'm not defeated

I put my hope in love that never fades
'Cause what the Lord gives
The world can't take
I hold onto the promise He won't break

'Cause what the Lord gives
The world can't take away
The world can't take away

The battle's on, I know that it's for real
But I'm standing on the rock that never shakes
The dark is always gonna try to steal
But I'm not afraid

I put my hope in love that never fades
'Cause what the Lord gives
The world can't take
I hold onto the promise he won't break
'Cause what the Lord gives

The world can't take away
The world can't take away
The world can't take away"
