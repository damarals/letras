"1" "Same Disease
Red

I am toxic, I am so impure
I am dying inside, I'm dying for a cure
Separated, I am quick to resist
I am all alone infected with this

I am immune to you, you're immune to me
We are both sick cells with the same disease

I'm a sun show, isolated and cored
Only you can judge me, you alone

I am immune to you, you're immune to me
We are both sick cells with the same disease
I am immune to you, you are immune to me
We are both sick cells with the same disease
I am immune to you, you are immune to me
We are both sick cells with the same disease

This attraction, we are not getting well
It's a fever I share, it's a plague you feel
Separated, I am quick to resist
I am all alone infected with this

I am immune to you, you're immune to me
We are both sick cells with the same disease
I am immune to you, you are immune to me
We are both sick cells with the same disease
I am immune to you, you are immune to me
We are both sick cells with the same disease

It's infecting me, it's infecting you
I'm running sick just like you
It's infecting me, it's infecting you
Inflict me with your love

I am immune to you, you are immune to me
We are both sick cells with the same disease
I am immune to you, you are immune to me
We are both sick cells with the same disease

We are both sick cells with the same disease
We are both sick cells with the same disease
We are both sick cells with the same disease
We are all sick souls with the same disease"
