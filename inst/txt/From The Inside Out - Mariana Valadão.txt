"1" "From The Inside Out
Mariana Valad√£o

A thousand times I've failed
Still your mercy remains
Should I stumble again
Still I'm caught in your grace

Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

In my heart, in my soul
I give you control
Consume me from the inside out
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love you from the inside out

Your will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing you praise

Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

In my heart, in my soul
I give you control
Consume me from the inside out
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love you from the inside out

Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart
Is to bring you praise
From the inside out
Lord my soul cries out"
