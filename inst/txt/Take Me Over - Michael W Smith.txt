"1" "Take Me Over
Michael W. Smith

Just to rest in your arms
Close enough to hear your heart
Just to kneel at your feet
Where everything fades away I sing


Jesus, Jesus take me over now
I surrender everything I have
I lay it down
All of me


With just a glimpse of your face
All my fears melt away
Lost within your embrace
I'm pouring out all my admiration"
