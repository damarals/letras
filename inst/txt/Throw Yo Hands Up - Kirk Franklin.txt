Verse 2:
You forgave me (You forgave me)
Then you changed me (Then you changed me)

This song goes out to all my young White and Latino brothers and sisters; all
colors, all colors, all nations, East Coast, West Coast, West side, thatâ€™s what
Iâ€™m saying.

Mic check, mic check, 1, 2, 1, 2
OH, get your hands up, people, cuz I thought you knew
That these praises going up, got these blessings coming down
Up town, down town, if you know how this sound
Then holla, from the East Coast
let me hear holla to the West Coast
even in the dirty south
Open up your mouth yâ€™all
Praise him like this yâ€™all
that yâ€™all
what yâ€™all
what yâ€™all

Ooooh, Ooooh, Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on, what, what

Ooooh, oooh, come on, come on, Ooooh, what, what, what, Ooooh, what, lift Him
up like this yâ€™all, like that yâ€™all, like this yâ€™all

Yo, TobeyMac

For the 2-0-0-2, I thought you knew, Baby

Listen:
For God so loved the World that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever
believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life, baby, no doubt,
baby, no doubt.

Chorus
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up (Ooooooh)
Throw your hands up (Ooooooh)

No doubt

Ooooooh
