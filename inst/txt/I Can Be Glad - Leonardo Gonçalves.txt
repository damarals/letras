"1" "I Can Be Glad
Leonardo Gon√ßalves

I can be glad for my hope is in the lord
'cause he gives a confidence that this world doesn't know
He's the lord of all creation and whatever the situation
I'm glad for my hope is in the lord

Oh right from the beginning, god made me for his own
So he replaced my weak foundation
And made himself the cornerstone
When all was ready and in order
He promised every day and hour
He'd be faithful to sustain me by his mighty power

I can be glad for my hope is in the lord
'cause he gives a confidence that this world doesn't know
He's the lord of all creation
And whatever the situation
I'm glad for my hope is in the lord

Well if i land in prison for calling on god's name
He will cause the walls to crumble under the fervor of my praise
For the cause of christ i've chosen to suffer death
To prove my stand, i'll be ushered into glory
Led by god's own hand

Every mountain, every fortress
Every word that is not his will pass away

I can be glad for my hope is in the lord
'cause he gives a confidence that this world doesn't know
He's the lord of all creation
And whatever the situation
I'm glad for my hope is in the lord

I'm glad, so glad for my hope is in the lord
My hope's built on nothing less
Than jesus' blood and righteousness
I'm glad, so glad
I'm glad, so glad that my hope is in the lord"
