"1" "You Are My Rock
Hillsong United

There's a voice en the silence
Piercing the darkness of my own selfish soul
There's a cry deep within me
A yearning to feel You, I look You Lord

I can't pretend I don't run from
The feelings I'm trying to hide
Must get the focus off me and my problems
I look to the cross

You are my rock, on You I stand
Safe from the storms that surround me
You're my only rock, in You I can
Don't have to rely on me own strenght"
