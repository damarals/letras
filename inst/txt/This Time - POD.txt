"1" "This Time
P.O.D.

And is this, where we need to be?
Or are we tired of looking?
Searching for more than eyes can see,
For something to believe in.
It slipped away, fell away, tried to play yourself
No turning back, all alone and there's nobody else,
Who even knows I'm missing.

And I and I will run
But This Time,
It's worth more than the chance we're taking.
And I and I will run
But This Time,
Wanting more has got me waiting
This Time for love.

And I have done this all before,
And nothing ever changes.
Waiting gets harder everytime,
I don't know how to stay still.
And nothing more left to lose, throw it all away
Maybe the last chance i get to see your face
I can't afford to leave here

And I and I will run
But This Time,
It's worth more than the chance we're taking.
And I and I will run
But This Time,
Wanting more has got me waiting
And I and I will run
But This Time,
I can't believe the chance we're taking
And I and I will run
But This Time,
I need to know so I'll be waiting
This Time for love.

And I and I will run
But This Time,
It's worth more than the chance we're taking.
And I and I will run
But This Time,
Wanting more has got me waiting
And I and I will run
But This Time,
I can't believe the chance we're taking
And I and I will run
And I and I will run
This Time for love."
