"1" "Standing On The Promisses (Medley)
Selah

Standing on the promises of Christ my King,
Through eternal ages let His praises ring.
Glory in the highest I will shout and sing
I'm standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises that cannot fail
When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail.
By the living word of God I shall prevail.
I'm standing on the promises of God.

Standing, standing, standing on the promises of God my Savior.
Standing, standing, standing on the promises of God.

What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
What a blessedness, what a peace is mine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

I'm leaning, leaning
Safe and secure from all alarms.
I'm leaning, I'm leaning, leaning on the everlasting arms

Brief interlude

Are you washed in the blood in the soul-cleansing blood
of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless, are the white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?

Yes, I'm standing, standing, standing on the promises
of God my Savior.
I'm standing, standing, standing on the promises of God.
Yes, I'm standing, standing?
I'm standing on the promises of God!"
