Kirk Franklin - Hero

The heavens were silent
The earth wept in pain
Nations were trembling and hope never came
Terror filled the air
And it wouldn't go away
We needed a hero to come and save the day

Famine and hunger,
Disease in the land
The hatred the killing taking lives from your hand
Creation waits throught the darkness we pray
Tell me where is the hero to come and save the day

Through the nails
Through the thorns
From the hill to the gave
Was a voice in the distance the lamb that was slain
My soul had no song and my debt I couldn't pay
When I needed a hero you came and you saved the day

To the homeless
The widow
The fatherless son
To the sick and the broken alone with no one
Lift up you head your hope is on the way
When we needed a hero you came and you saved the day

Bridge:
When the curtain had closed
And it felt like the end
When your blood caught the fall and took away every sin
Even though men deny
You're the only sacrifice
That loved us enough you love us so much Lord
That you gave your life see you saved my life

Now I can see you I'm no longer ashamed
Your power I feel see our lives have exchanged
Every wrong is erased, Jesus
You are my hero you came and saved the day

Bridge:
When the curtain had closed
And it felt like the end
When your blood caught the fall and took away every sin
Even though men deny
You're the only sacrifice
That loved us enough you love us so much Lord
That you gave your life see you saved my life

Now I can see you I'm no longer ashamed
Your power I feel see our lives have exchanged
Every wrong is erased, Jesus
You are my hero you came and saved (x2)
You are my hero you came and saved The day

Vamp:
You saved you saved the day(repeat)

you are my hero you came and you saved the day
