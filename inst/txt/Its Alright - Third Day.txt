Third Day

Lyrics by Mac Powell/Music by Third Day
From the recording: Come Together, Track #6.

Your letter said that you were leaving
But you didn't know how long
I have never stopped believing
That one day you would return
And though waiting is the hardest
Part of everything I do
I do confess it's getting better
Knowing I will be with you

It's alright
It's okay
I won't worry about tomorrow
For it brings me one more day
Closer than I was to you

Now the question isn't \"will you\"
What I want to know is \"when\"
If it's one day or a million
I will wait for you 'til then
So I'm holding on to your words
And the promises you've made
There is not one you have broken
There's not one I didn't take

Your letter said that you were leaving
But you didn't know how long
I will never stop believing
"
