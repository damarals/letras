Hillsong United

You are deserving

Of all the praises Lord

And I am yearning

To be in Your presence once more

Deep inside my heart is burning

I want to give You more

For You're the only one that I adore


How great You are

How great You are

You are the mighty King

And You've come to reign in me

How great You are

How great You are

I give You all the praises of my heart"
