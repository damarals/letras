"x"
"1" "Let Your Love Be Strong
Switchfoot

In this world of news, I've found nothing new
I've found nothing pure
Maybe I'm just idealistic to assume that truth
Could be fact and form
That love could be a verb
Maybe I'm just a little misinformed

As the dead moon rises, and the freeways sigh
Let the trains watch over the tides and the mist
Spinning circles in our sky's tonight
Let the trucks roll in from Los Angeles
Maybe our stars are unanimously tired

(chorus)
Let your love be strong
And I don't care what goes down
Let your love be strong enough
To weather through the thunder cloud
Fury and thunder clap like stealing the fire from your skies
All of my world hanging on your love

Let the wars begin, let my strength wear thin
Let my fingers crack, let my world fall apart
Train the monkeys on my back to fight
Let it start tonight
When my world explodes
When my stars touch the ground
Falling down like broken satellites

(chorus)"
