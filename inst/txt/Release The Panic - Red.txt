"1" "Release The Panic
Red

I don't mean to, to alarm you
Can't you see now, it overtakes you
You're declining, desintegrating
You're gonna lose it all
The time you are wasting

Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Blackout!
Let your panic out!

Let it out, let it out
Release the panic, release the panic
Get it out, get it out, get it out
Release the panic, release the panic
Cause you're trapped in the countdown
And your days are numbered
Don't you know what you're done for?
Right now, lights out, let your panic out!

You can feel it, but you're ignoring
It creeps up on you, without a warning
You think you're thriving, but you're decaying
You're gonna lose it all
There's no escaping

Let it out, let it out
Release the panic, release the panic
Get it out, get it out, get it out
Release the panic, release the panic
Cause you're trapped in the countdown
And your days are numbered
Don't you know what you're done for?
Right now, lights out, let your panic out!

Feel it, slip away, slip away
You know you're done for, you're done
You can't get away, get away
You know you're done for, you're done for

Let it out, let it out
Release the panic, release the panic
Get it out, get it out, get it out, get it out
Release the panic, release the panic

Let it out, let it out
Release the panic, release the panic
Get it out, get it out, get it out
Release the panic, release the panic"
