"1" "I Trust You
Skillet

Learning again that I am not my own
Crawling back to where I belong
Caught in between knowing You and trusting me
Come on take a ride out of the in-betweens
Now I know I need you

When I can't see, I will trust You
And when I get weak, I trust You
And when I just can't let it go
I trust that You are in control

Shelter me so I can find some peace
Grabbing hold of You is letting go of me
It's easy when I remember I possess all that lays beyond my grasp
You power commands the weight off my back
Now I know I need you

When I can't see, I will trust You
And when I get weak, I trust You
And when I just can't let it go
I trust that You are in control

Now I know I trust you
