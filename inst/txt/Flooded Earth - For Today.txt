"1" "Flooded Earth
For Today

Like a drowning man to a sinking ship
I cling to the things that I know will kill me
Is this all I am? Is this really it?
It's time to sink or swim

Like a drowning man to a sinking ship
I cling to the things I know will kill me
Is this all I am? Is this really it?
It's time to sink or swim

Neck deep in desperation
It's pulling me under
Neck deep in desperation
It's pulling me under

I know the ocean wasn't put into place
To swallow a man who simply lost his way
But all false ambition sinks like a stone
In the pit of our souls

I won't carry this anchor anymore
I won't carry this anchor anymore

My wandering heart cries out
For anything I could hold onto

To pull me from the waves
All around me
My heart is pounding, and I
Am begging you to pull me, pull me

Like a drowning man to a sinking ship
I cling to the things that I know will kill me
Is this all I am? Is this really it?
It's time to sink or swim

Like a drowning man to a sinking ship
I cling to the things that I know will kill me
Is this all I am? Is this really it?
It's time to sink or swim

Rise above this flooded earth
Rise above this flooded earth

The water still rushes to fill my lungs
I fight for the surface to see the sun
I still believe

Pull me from the waves
All around me
My heart is pounding, and I
Am begging you to pull me

Pull me from the waves
All around me
My heart is pounding, and I
Am begging you to pull me
Pull me out"
