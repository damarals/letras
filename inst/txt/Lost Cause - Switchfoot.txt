"1" "Lost Cause
Switchfoot

I took the midnight path
In the aftermath
Tearing out the sutures
Is a new way back
To a broken past
Just our broken future?

I heard you tore it all down
Destroyed the world we found

Are we a lost cause?
Are we just lost cause
We won't be the future we refuse to see?
And if I'm your lost cause
It will be your lost cause
You won't see me as I am, not the enemy
I'll be your lost cause

Do you remember us
On a late night bus
Taking everything for granted?
You're so scary with the lights on
That my love songs are fight songs
But my punches never landed

I heard you tore it all done
Destroyed the world we found
The world we found

Are we a lost cause?
Are we just lost cause
We won't be the future we refuse to see?
And if I'm your lost cause
It'll be your lost cause
You won't see me as I am, not the enemy
I'll be your lost cause
Are we a lost cause?
Are we just lost cause
We won't be the future we refuse to see?
And if I'm your lost cause
It'll be your lost cause
You won't see me as I am, the possibility
Yeah, I'm not the enemy

I'll be your lost cause"
