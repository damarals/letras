"1" "Summer Of Love
Delirious

There is a light that shines upons us
There is a heaven, it's where I'm longing to be
Would you please come talk to me

There is a darkness that falls upon us
There is a blindness that makes me hunger for you
Will you lead me through?

Summer of Love, so full of pain
Summer of Love, was God to blame

There is a song I have been singing
It brings the healing, that's what I'm longing to see
Would you please come fall on me

You probably know that I love a Saviour
His name is Jesus, and I am living to be
Just a faithful one to Thee

Summer of Love, so full of pain
Summer of Love, was God to blame
Summer of Love, so full of shame
Summer of Love, was God to blame"
