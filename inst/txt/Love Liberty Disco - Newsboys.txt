"x"
"1" "Love Liberty Disco
Newsboys

and if I told you there's somebody who loves you
would you say, hey, show me that face
and if I told you that your feeling was actual
would you say, hey, take me to that place
and if I said there is a family
a body that moves as one
oh do you feel the LOVE that invites us, the LIBERTY that excites us
the DISCO has just begun
it's just begun

Chorus
give me LOVE, give me LIBERTY, DISCO
the place everybody in the family's found
on that day, we will all be happy people
when LOVE, LIBERTY, DISCO's in town

and as we step into in the light of the lover
we're all the same though we're rich or poor
and, you know it's never been good for a man to be alone
so come on in your name's on the door
what are we waiting for?

- Chorus -

all our fears are turning 'round
fall down and meet your maker
where our true selves we'll be found
callin' out to every lonely soul

- Chorus (5x) -
