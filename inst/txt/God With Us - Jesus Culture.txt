Jesus Culture

You are matchless in grace and mercy
There is nowhere we can hide from your love
You are steadfast, never failing, you are faithful
All creation is in awe of who you are
You're the healer of the sick and the broken
You are comfort for every heart in loss
Our king and our savior forever
For eternity we will sing of all you've done
For eternity we will sing of all you've done
We sing

God with us, God for us
Nothing can come against
No one can stand between us
God with us, God for us
Nothing can come against
No one can stand between us

Your heart, it moves with compassion
There is life, there is healing in your love
You're the father, the son, the holy spirit
For eternity we will sing of all you've done
We sing

(Bridge)

Where there was death
You brought life, lord
Where there was fear
You brought courage
When I was afraid
You were with me
And you lifted me up
And you lifted me up"
