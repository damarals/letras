Vineyard

Oh God, I need You more than ever
Oh God, I need You more than ever
I need to feel Your arms around me
Holding me tight
I want Your love to surround me
All through the night
I'm desiring Your presence
Flowing in my life

You are my all in all
You are my Prince of Peace
You are my Rock
My Savior and my King
You are my Holy Father
Guiding me through
I'm living a life of righteousness

(Holy righteousness)

Oh God, I love You more than ever
Oh God, I love You more than ever
For You hear my voice when
I cry out for Your touch
And when I seek Your face
You fill me up
I'm living in Your beauty
And I will sing Your song"
