"1" "Make Me Yours
Vineyard

Whisper in the quietness
Make me worthy of Your trust
Come and pour Your fragrance on me
Take me where the veil is torn
Where purity will be restored
Where Iâ€™m captured no more by sin

Invite me where only You can go
Call my name, take me as Your own
And I will praise from a deeper place
As I choose to thank You, Lord
And I will stand on Your faithfulness
Show me what it means to be Yours
Make me Yours

From every nation, tribe and tongue
We fix our eyes upon the Son
We fall down before the one Holy God
Teach us what it means to abide
In the place of peace where You reside
Where true worship will rise to the King

Invite us where only You can go
Make us one, take us as Your own"
