"x"
"1" "Anything 4 U
Kirk Franklin

Sometimes this rocky road
Is filled with aches and pain
Sometimes you win
Sometimes you lose
But in Christ you'll always gain
They just don't understand
How Your love brought me out
That's why I can stand and testify
Say without a doubt

CHORUS
Anything for You
Jesus, I'll do anything
Anything for You
I'll do anything for You
For You, anything for You
Anything for You, for You
Anything

I give my broken heart
So that You can make it whole
I'll never go astray
This is joy that fills my soul

I'll tell the dying world
How Your love has set me free
I really love You Lord
Because You first loved me

REPEAT CHORUS

Climb the highest mountain
I'll swim the deepest sea
Conquer new horizons
Because You first loved me
Because You first loved me

I'll do anything
Anything for You"
