"1" "My Lord And I
Gaither Vocal Band

We're gonna' walk this road to Glory, children,
My Lord and I;
We're gonna' walk and tell the story, children,
My Lord and I;
When I come to the river, wide,
The blessed Lord is gonna' calm the tide,
We're gonna' walk this road to Glory, (children)
My Lord and I
(Repeat)

We're gonna' walk this road to Glory, children,
My Lord and I;
We're gonna' walk and tell the story, children,
My Lord and I;
Rain or shine, snow or sleet,
Blessed Lord, guide my feet
We're gonna' walk this road to glory (children)
My Lord and I

Such is my consolation
Burdens out of the way
The Holy Spirit guides me
As I travel day by day
I just pull into the station
And I get a full supply
We're gonna' walk this road to glory (children)
My Lord and I

We're gonna walk and talk all the way to glory
We're gonna walk and tell the blessed old story
Walk and talk all the way to Glory
My Lord and I
When I come to the river, wide
The blessed Lord is gonna calm the tide
We're gonna' walk this road to glory (children)
My Lord and I
(Repeat)"
