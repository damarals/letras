Newsboys

In these days of despair
Uncertainty and fear there
In a salvation I believe
I believe in you, I believe in you

I believe in Jesus Christ
I believe in God the Father
I believe in the Holy Spirit
What a new life brings us
I believe in the cross of Christ
When death finally won
I believe that resurrection
Very soon will return
I believe in you

May our faith not be hymns
Only notes in songs
And even in temptations and weak
I believe in you, I believe in you

I believe in Jesus Christ
I believe in God the Father
I believe in the Holy Spirit
What in the new life brings
I believe in the cross of Christ
When death finally won
I believe that, resurrected
Very soon will return

The lost found forgiveness
For now, here, love has overcome
And may the church live this love
I believe in you, I believe in you
And the chains will not prevail
For the veil rent and fall to the ground
Your love will not come back in vain
I believe in you, I believe in you

I believe in Jesus Christ
I believe in God the Father
I believe in the Holy Spirit
What in the new life brings
I believe in the cross of Christ
And that death has finally won
I believe that, resurrected
Pretty soon
Coming soon
Coming soon"
