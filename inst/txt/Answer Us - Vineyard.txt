Oh Lord, let it be known today
That you are God
And let it be known
That we are your servants
Oh Lord, we have obeyed your Word,
For you are God
Let it be known that you are our God

Turn the hearts of your people
Back to you again
We are watching, we are waiting
When will you bring revival

Answer us, oh answer us
Send your fire, send your rain
Answer us, oh answer us
Won't you demonstrate your power
Answer us, oh answer us
Send your fire send your rain
Answer us, oh answer us
Won't you bring your revelation once again


Oh Lord, let it be seen today
That you are God
Stretch out your hand
And send fire from heaven
Oh Lord, let it be seen today
That you are God
Stretch out your hand
And send rain from heaven"
