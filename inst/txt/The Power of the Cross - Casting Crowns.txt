"1" "The Power of the Cross
Casting Crowns

The past that held regret
Over my head is gone
These chains are ashes now
That once were rusted on
I was a runaway
Now I am finally home

My mind was a ghost town
Haunted by yesterday
Until Your hand reached down
Pulled me out of my grave
Into the freedom found
Only in Jesus' Name

I am forgiven
No longer lost
Now I am living
In the power of the Cross

The Father gave His Son
So I could be set free
And now the scales are gone
My eyes can finally see
I'll tell the world of all
Jesus has done for me

I am forgiven
No longer lost
Now I am living
In the power of the Cross
Goodbye to sorrow
Welcome, my joy
Now I am living
In the power of the Cross

And on that Cross, His love held true
Through sacrifice, the old made new
This life I live, I live in faith
Now in Jesus' Name

I am forgiven
No longer lost
Now I am living
In the power of the Cross
Goodbye to sorrow (Goodbye to sorrow)
Welcome, my joy (Welcome, my joy, 'cause I'm livin')
Now I am living (Yes, I'm livin')
In the power of the Cross (Power of the Cross)

Thank You
Oh God, I thank You
Jesus, I thank You
Thank You for the Cross
Praise You
Oh God, I praise You
Jesus, I praise You
Praise You for the Cross"
