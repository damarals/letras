"1" "Preaching To All Sorts Of People
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

We really want to imitate our God
To be impartial, as we know he is
To save all sorts of people is his will
He welcomes all to come and to be his

It's the person, not the place
It's the heart and not the face
God's message to all people we extend
So because we really care
We keep preaching everywhere

All sorts of people can become God's friend
It doesn't matter where they may be found
Or what at first they might appear to be
What really counts is what they are at heart
The inner self, the one jehovah sees

It's the person, not the place
It's the heart and not the face
God's message to all people we extend
So because we really care
We keep preaching everywhere

All sorts of people can become God's friend
Jehovah welcomes all who make the choice
To leave the world and all its ways behind
This we have learned, and this we want to share
And so we preach to people of all kinds

It's the person, not the place
It's the heart and not the face
God's message to all people we extend
So because we really care
We keep preaching everywhere
All sorts of people can become God's friend"
