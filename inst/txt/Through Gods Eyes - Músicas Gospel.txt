"1" "Through Gods Eyes
MÃºsicas Gospel

We are all the same.
Because from him,
Is where we all came.

No one will be better,
Than the next in line.
The Lords hates to see,
Discriminating minds.

Chorus:
God doesn't see color,
When he looks at a man.
He won't ask your race,
Before he lends a hand.
Through God's eyes,
We all look the same.
He can see our hurts,
And he feels our pain.

God created men,
In the image of him.
And it's because of love,
We are born from above.

Someday there'll be no hate,
When Jesus comes again.
Love will fill our minds,
And men will love all men.

Chorus:
God doesn't see color,
When he looks at a man.
He won't ask your race,
Before he lends a hand.
Through God's eyes,
We all look the same.
He can see our hurts,
And he feels our pain."
