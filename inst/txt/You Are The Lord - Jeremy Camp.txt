"1" "You Are The Lord
Jeremy Camp

You open my eyes
And we see into Your kingdom
The promise of grace
And You lead us into freedom
We're bound in Your love
And all sin has been forgotten
At the foot of the cross
Where our ransom has been given

If God is for us who can be against us
Who can be against our GOD

Let all your people raise their voices
Now as Your glory fills this place
Heaven and earth will not be silent
For You are the Lord that is Your name
Yes You are the Lord that is Your name

You give life to us all
And you breathe on us Your spirit
We will walk in Your ways
As a light unto the nations
You go before us Father you protect us
Father you provide for us all

Your name Oh Lord is a rushing wind
Your Word is a shelter strong within
My portion and my deliverance
Oh, Jesus
Let all Your people raise their voices
Now as your glory fills this place
Heaven and earth will not be silent
For You are the Lord that is Your name
Yes You are the Lord that is Your name
For You are the Lord that is Your name
Yes You are the Lord that is Your name
