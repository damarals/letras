"1" "Lord Have Mercy (worship Again)
Michael W. Smith

Jesus, I've forgotten the words that You have spoken
Promises that burned within my heart have now grown dim
With a doubting heart I follow the paths of earthly wisdom
Forgive me for my unbielief
renew the fire again

Chorus (refr√£o)

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me

female voice:
I have built an altar where I worship things of man
I have taken journeys that have draw me far from You
Now I am returning to Your mercies ever flowing
Pardon my transgressions
Help me love You again

Repeat Chorus:

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me

Michael W. Smith

I have Longed to know You and Your tender mercies
Like a river of forgiveness ever flowing without end
I bow my heart before Your in the goodness of Your presence
Your grace forever shining
Like a beacon in the night

Repeat Chorus:

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me"
