"1" "His Glory Appears
Hillsong United

You gave me hope
You made me whole
at the cross
You took my place
You show me grace
At the cross where You died for me

Chorus
And his glory appears
Like the light from sun
Age to age He shines
Oh, Look to the skies
Hear the angels cry
singing holy is the lord"
