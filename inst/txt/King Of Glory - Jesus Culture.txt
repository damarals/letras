(Verse 1:)
Your face outshines the brightest sun
Jesus, you're glorious, you are so glorious
With eyes that blaze like burning fire
Jesus, you're glorious, you are so glorious

(Chorus:)
King of Glory, have your glory
King of Glory, have your glory

(Verse 2:)
Your voice like rushing waters sounds
Jesus, you're powerful, you are so powerful
And in your hands you hold the stars
Jesus, you're powerful, you are so powerful"
