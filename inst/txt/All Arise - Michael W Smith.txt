"1" "All Arise
Michael W. Smith

There is only One
Whose majesty is unending
There is only One
The King of Kings, never failing

All, all arise
At the name
Of our Savior
Who is worthy
You are worthy

There is only One
He's lifted high for the world to see
There is only One
One love alone overwhelms the grave
Yes, Your love alone overwhelms the grave

All, all arise
At the name
Of our Savior
Who is worthy
You are worthy

All praise is Yours
Yours alone
The almighty
Who is worthy
You are worthy

There is power, there is power
At the sound of Your name, Jesus
[x4]

At the sound of Your name

All, all arise
At the name
Of our Savior
Who is worthy
You are worthy

All praise is Yours
Yours alone
The almighty
Who is worthy
You are worthy"
