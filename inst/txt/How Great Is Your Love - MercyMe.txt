MercyMe

My heart is steadfast oh God
And I will sing
With all my heart and soul
Music for the King
And I will awake the dawn
With my praise to You oh Lord

How great is Your love
So much higher than the heavens
With faithfulness that reaches the sky
How great is Your love
So much higher than the heavens
With faithfulness that reaches the sky
How great is Your love [oh yeah]

Praise the Lord, oh my soul
And glory to the King
Forever you are robed with majesty
We come to You oh Lord
And lay our praise at you feet

How great is Your love
So much higher than the heavens
With faithfulness that reaches the sky
How great is Your love
So much higher than the heavens
With faithfulness that reaches the sky

Be Exalted oh God and Let your Glory reign
Be Exalted oh God and Let your Glory reign
Let it reign, let it reign, let it reign
Let it reign, let it reign, let it reign

How great is Your love
So much higher than the heavens
With faithfulness that reaches the sky
How great is Your love
So much higher than the heavens
With faithfulness that reaches the sky
