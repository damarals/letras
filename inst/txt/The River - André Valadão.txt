"1" "The River
André Valadão

As I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of La
The footsteps that were next to me
Have gone their seperate ways
I've seen enough now to know
That beautiful things
Don't always stay that way
I've done enough now to know
This beautiful place isn't everything they say
I heard that evil comes disguised
Like a city of angels
I'm walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life
And I want to be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong
But I swear I'm a believer
Like the prodigal son
I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered
I'm delivered

You're from a small town
You're gonna grow up fast underneath these lights
Down in Hollywood on the boulevard
the dead come back to life
To the praying mother and the worried father
let your children go
If they come back they'll come home stronger
And if they don't you'll know

They say that evil come disguised
Like a city of angels
I'm walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life
And I want to be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong
But I swear I'm a believer
Like the prodigal son
I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered
I'm delivered

Baptized in the river
On my own
Baptized in the river
On my own
I wanna be delivered
On my own
On my own

Baptized in the river
On my own
I wanna be delivered

I confess I'm a sinner
I've seen a vision of my life and I wanna be delivered"
