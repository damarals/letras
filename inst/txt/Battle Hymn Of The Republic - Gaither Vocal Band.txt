"1" "Battle Hymn Of The Republic
Gaither Vocal Band

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on!

Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
His truth is marching on!

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgement seat.
O be swift, my soul, to answer Him and be jubilant my feet
His truth is marching on!

Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
His truth is marching on!

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea
With the glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me.
As He died to make men holy let us live to make men free
While God is marching on!

Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
Glory, glory hallelujah!
His truth is marching on!

His truth is marching on!"
