"1" "To Him Be Glory
Diante do Trono

For of him and through him
And to him are all things
For of him and through him
And to him are all things

To him be glory
To him be glory
To him be glory
Forever, amen

O the depth of the riches both
Of the wisdom and knowledge of god
How unsearchable are
His judgments and his ways

To him be glory
To him be glory
To him be glory, glory, glory
Forever, amen"
