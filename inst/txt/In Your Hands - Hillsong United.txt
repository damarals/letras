"1" "In Your Hands
Hillsong United

I'm so secure, You're here with me
You stay the same, Your love remains here in my heart

So close I believe, You're holding me now
In Your Hands I belong, You'll never let me go
So close I believe You're holding me now
In Your Hands I belong, You'll never let me go

You gave your life
In Your endless love
You set me free
And showed the way
Now I am found

All along, You were beside me
Even when I could'nt tell
Through the years, You showed me more of You, more of You
