"1" "Caught Up
Kirk Franklin

[Chorus]
Caught up to meet Him
Can't wait see Him
When He cracks the sky
Can't wait to hold Him
By His touch I will know Him
Together Jesus and I

[Chorus]

The trumpet shall sound
We'll all be changed
We'll walk the streets of gold
One day I'm gonna behold my Savior's face
I'll finally be in that place
I'll finally, I'll find peace for my very soul

In a moment in a twinkling
Oh, He's gonna call my name (yes)
I'll be caught up in the twinkling of an eye (yes I will)
See, these other things they don't compare
To the joy God's got over there
We'll be together we're gonna get together.
Jesus and I (oh yeah)

[Chorus]

[Vamp]
Caught up
To see Jesus
Caught up
To see Jesus
I will be caught up
Caught up
Caught up (repeat)
Together Jesus and I
Together Jesus and I"
