"1" "Somebody Loves Me
Gaither Vocal Band

Somebody loves me, answers my prayer
I love somebody, I know He cares.
Somebody tells me not to repine
That somebody is Jesus, and I know He's mine.

You'll be happy if you will let Jesus have His way
He has work for us all to do every passing day:
Feed the hungry and cheer the sad, for the sinner pray.
You'll have joy that you've never had, and you then can say:

Somebody loves me, answers my prayer
I love somebody, I know He cares.
Somebody tells me not to repine
That somebody is Jesus, and I know He's mine.

Somebody loves me, answers my prayer
I love somebody, I know He cares.
Somebody tells me not to repine
That somebody is Jesus, and I know He's mine.

Somebody loves me, answers my prayer
I love somebody, I know He cares.
Somebody tells me not to repine
That somebody is Jesus, and I know He's mine
That somebody is Jesus, and I know He's mine."
