Hillsong United

Verse 1:
I am not afraid
You have called me by name
I am your child
My weakness is your strength
I stand on rock not sand
I live to fulfil your plan
(repeat)

Chorus:
When I go through the waters
You will be with me
When I go through the rivers
I will not drown
When I walk through the fire
I can not be burned
Your the rock on which I stand

Verse 2:
I have no need to fear
I walk with you so near
My god supplies all my needs
Today I sing this song
And think of what you've done
I will not rest til' the world sees
