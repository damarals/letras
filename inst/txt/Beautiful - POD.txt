"1" "Beautiful
P.O.D.

You stand with a gun in your hand
Staring at the wall with a look so sad
And thinking about who really cares?
Will they even notice if I just disappear now?
One bang, blood rush to the head
She'd rather fly through the sky
than walk with the dead
So she stays high while the world goes by
And just another day here waiting to die

Life is beautiful
Share a little love with the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing along
When we sing why-o,
Why-o

She cries but her man denies
It's funny how love comes with so many lies
And he said he'd never do it again
So she puts on a smile and she starts to pretend
She hides all the pain inside
By filling up her arms with pretty little lines
She cuts with no intent to kill
This time she didn't do it
But someday she will

Life is beautiful
Share a little love with the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing this song
When we sing why-o,
Why-o

And hey, you're beautiful
And there's enough love for the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing along
When we sing why-o,
Why-o

And hey, I know that you can find a way
You're beautiful to me
No matter what the people say
It's all gonna be ok
You're beautiful to me

Too weak too weary to try
Too angry inside, well so am I
I'm all alone with nobody else
So in need of help, I keep reminding myself that

Life is beautiful
Share a little love with the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing this song
When we sing why-o,
Why-o

And hey, you're beautiful
And there's enough love for the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing along
When we sing why-o,
Why-o

And hey, I know that you can find the way
You're beautiful to me
No matter what people say
It's all gonna be ok
You're beautiful to me
It's all gonna end someday
It's all gonna fade away
You're beautiful to me
You're beautiful to me
You're beautiful to me"
