"x"
"1" "No Stopping Us
Dominic Balli

I was just a poor boy playing in the school yard
Didn't wanna go home back to my broke home
Looking for a way out wishing it was just a dream
My pops and my momma never ending drama
Thought we'd be together always and forever
Custody battles not how it's supposed to be

And I know, you know exactly what I mean
We'll take this world on together
Whatever me and you

All of the hell we've been through
There's no stopping us now
We're marching on moving forward
Like soldiers don't look back
Can you see where we're at
There's no stopping us now

She was such a cool girl always in the cool crowd
Everything was all right living in the the lime light
But sometimes things don't end the way they start
In and out of rehab trying to forgive Dad

Smokin' 'til she feel numb cutting 'til she feel some
Crazy how it all can fall apart
And I know, you know exactly what I mean"
