"1" "So Worthy Of All Praise
Vineyard

All creation, cries out Your name
It can't keep silent
Calling out Your fame
We join together, singing in this song
You are worthy

So worthy of all praise
So worthy of all praise
So worthy of all praise
So worthy of all praise

Oh Lord we come to You in awe and wonder
For You O God, are our salvation
Open our eyes to see all Your beauty
All creation calls Your name
We join together and sing so worthy"
