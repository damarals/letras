"1" "Needle And Haystack Life
Switchfoot

The world begins
With newborn skin
We are right now

You're a needle girl
In a haystack world
We are right now

You breathe it in
The highs and lows
We call it living

(Chorus)
In this needle and haystack life
I've found miracle's there in your eyes
It's no accident we're here tonight
We are once in a lifetime

No, don't let go
Don't give up hope
All is forgiven

You breathe it in
The highs and lows
We call it living

All is not lost
All is not lost
Become who you are
It happens once in a lifetime"
