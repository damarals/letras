"1" "Can't Stop Thinkin 'bout You
Take 6

Everyday you see
The sun has passed around you
But you never stop to hear my song
Late at night I send
The stars to shine above you
But morning comes
And then you're gone

If you can't be sure
Of the air you breathe
Then you can depend on me

Because
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
You mean the world to me, oh
A friend to the end
I'll always be true
You can depend on me
'Cause I just can't stop
Thinking 'bout you, oh
I'm thinkin 'bout you

Now I've seen the rain
In Spring
To start the flowers blooming
There's nothing
That I wouldn't do for you
Open your eyes
You'll see Heaven is awaiting
I'll give the world
To get you through

You can't be sure
Of the air you breathe
You can depend on me

'Cause
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
You mean the world to me, oh
A friend to the end
I'll always be true
You can depend on me
'Cause I just can't stop
Oh no, no, no
Thinking 'bout you

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
You mean the world to me, oh
A friend to the end
I'll always be true
You can depend on me

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
You mean the world to me, oh
A friend to the end
I'll always be true
You can depend on me

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
You mean the world to me, oh
A friend to the end
I'll always be true
You can depend on me"
