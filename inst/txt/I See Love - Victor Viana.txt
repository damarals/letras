"1" "I See Love
Victor Viana

I see love from sky
Love up high
Love from you

I see love in those eyes
Maybe tonight
You'll find this love, too

All my life I've been spending all my time
With things that not pleased you

All I want is to give you all my life
For once I just wanna have
One love

Maybe I don't have it right
Searching for a life
All my days I'll give to you
Tonight

I don't know what to do
Lead my life, guide it trough
I'll seek you till I see your love
Love from above"
