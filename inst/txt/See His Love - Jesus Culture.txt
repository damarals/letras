"1" "See His Love
Jesus Culture

(Verse 1:)
See His love nailed onto a cross
Perfect and blameless life given as sacrifice
See Him there all in the name of love
Broken yet glorious all for the sake of us

(Chorus:)
This is Jesus in His glory
King of heaven dying for me
It is finished He has done it
Death is beaten Heaven beckons me

(Verse 2:)
Greater love no one could ever show
Mercy so undeserved freedom I should not know
All my sin all of my hidden shame
Died with Him on the cross eternity won for us

(Bridge:)
Such love such love
Such love is this for me"
