"1" "If We Are The Body
Casting Crowns

It´s crowded in worship today
As she slips in trying to fade into the faces
The girls teasing laughter is carrying farther than
they know
Farther than they know

Chorus
But if we are the body
Why aren´t His arms reaching?
Why aren´t His hands healing?
Why aren´t His words teaching?
And if we are the body
Why aren´t His feet going?
Why is His love not showing them there is a way?
There is a way.

A traveler is far away from home
He sheds his coat and quietly sinks into the back row
The weight of their judgmental glances
Tells him that his chances are better out on the road

Jesus paid much too high a price
For us to pick and choose who should come
And we are the body of Christ

Jesus is the way

Based on James 2:1-9 (Tiago 2:1-9)"
