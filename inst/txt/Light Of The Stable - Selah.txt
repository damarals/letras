Light Of The Stable


Hail, hail to the newborn king
Let our voices sing him our praises
Hail, hail to the guiding light
That brought us tonight to our savior

Ale, alleluia, alle, alleluia
Ale, alleluia, alle, alleluia

Come now, where it shines so bright
To the knowing light of the stable
Kneel close to the child so dear
Cast aside your fear and the thankful

Ale, alleluia, alle, alleluia"
