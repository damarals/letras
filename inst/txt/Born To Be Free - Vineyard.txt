"1" "Born To Be Free
Vineyard

Set us free now
Free to worship
Set us free now
Free to worship

We were born to be free
We were born to be with You and praise You
We were born to be free
We were born to be in Your embrace

Set us free now
Free from bondage
Set us free now
Free from slavery

In your arms I am truly free
On the cross You made the way for me
To come close through the blood You shed
It's the perfect sacrifice"
