"1" "I Say Praise To The Lord
MÃºsicas Gospel

I say praise to the Lord,
For all I have received.
Whenever I need help,
It is always received.

The Lord gave me vision,
And the life that I live.
Whatever it is he needs,
Are the things I will give.

I strayed from his path,
But he's taken me back.
I say praiseto the Lord,
He put me back on track.

When you are a lost soul,
And have no place to go.
The Lord is always home,
You don't have to be alone.

I strayed from his path,
But he's taken me back.
I say praiseto the Lord,
He put me back on track."
