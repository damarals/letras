"1" "I Bless Your Name
Selah

In prisoner’s chains with bleeding stripes
Paul and Silas prayed that night
And in their pain began to see
Their chains were loosed and they were free

I bless your name
I bless your name
I give you honor, give you praise
You are the life, the truth, the way
I bless your name

Some midnight hour if you should find
You’re in a prison of your mind
Reach out praise, defy those chains
And they will fall in Jesus’ name

I bless your name
I bless your name
I give you honor, give you praise
You are the life, the truth, the way
I bless your name"
