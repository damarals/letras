"1" "Simply Because
Britt Nicole

Worship you for who you are
You died to set us free
Your nail-scarred hands
Have washed me clean

Surround me in your perfect grace
I know one day I feel your warm embrace
Jesus

Take me, hold me in your arms
Back, where I belong
Yes, you told me if I follow you
I''ll never be alone
And I worship you simply because

See my heart, so I can be
A light that shines from you eternally
Jesus
Surround me in your perfect grace
I know one day I'll feel your warm embrace
Jesus

Take me, hold me in your arms
Back, where I belong
Yes, you told me if I follow you
I'll never be alone
And I worship you simply because

You're my comfort, you're my strength
And your love will never end
I will always follow you

Take me, hold me in your arms
Back, where I belong
Yes, you told me if I follow you
I'll never be alone
And I worship you simply because

Worship you for who you are
You died to set us free
Your nail-scarred hands
Have washed me clean"
