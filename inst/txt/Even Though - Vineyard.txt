"1" "Even Though
Vineyard

Even though I can't see the sun through these clouds
I know it still shines
Even though I can't feel Your love through this pain
I know You're alive

Chorus:
Even though I can't understand
Why this storm still blows, and
Even though I can't hear Your voice
I love Your rain

Even though I can't see the way up ahead
I know that You lead
Even though I can't feel Your presence now
I know I believe

Even though I can't understand
Why the storm still blows, and
Even though I can't hear Your voice
I love Your rain

Bridge:
Who can measure Your greatness
Who can count all Your faithfulness
Who can doubt that Your presence
Silences every lie"
