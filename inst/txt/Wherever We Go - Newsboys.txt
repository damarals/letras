"1" "Wherever We Go
Newsboys

Wherever we go, bluebirds sing
And the flowers bloom
And the grass gets green
It's a curious thing
But it's just our thing
Wherever we go, the bees behave
In the treetops, squirrels smile and wave
It's a curious thing
And it's humbling
Where we go, little glow-worms glow
Little roadrunners run ahead
Gonna tell their friends
Little mice, little men
Get 'em all excited
All invited

HANDS UP
HOLLER BACK HERE
LET'S THROW THIS PARTY IN GEAR
WE BROUGHT THE WELCOME MAT
WHEREVER WE GO, THAT'S WHERE THE PARTY'S AT
HANDS UP
HOLLER BACK NOW
WE DON'T CLAIM ANY KNOW-HOW
WEâ€™RE GIVING GOD ALL THAT
WHEREVER WE GO, THAT'S WHERE THE PARTY'S AT

Wherever we go, the dumb get wise
And the crime rates drop
And the markets rise
It's a curious thing
But it's just our thing
Bullies make nice, crooks repent
And the ozone layer shows improvement
It's a curious thing
And it's humbling
Wherever we're led
All the Living Dead
Wanna leave their Zombie Mob
It's a touching scene when they all come clean
God help us, we just love our job

HANDS UP
HOLLER BACK HERE
LET'S THROW THIS PARTY IN GEAR
WE BROUGHT THE WELCOME MAT
WHEREVER WE GO, THAT'S WHERE THE PARTY'S AT"
