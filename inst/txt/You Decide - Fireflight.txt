"1" "You Decide
Fireflight

Fiction and reality collide
Faceless and so busted up inside
You've been searching, you've been crying out,
Will you be destroyed by all your doubt?

You decide
(Who will you run to)
Wrong or right
(there is no reason)
For you to hide
Only love can change your life
You decide

God is calling out to you again
Let Him pull you, let Him take you in
From the fear that swallows up you life
Will you stay the same or will you fight?

You decide
(Who will you run to)
Wrong or right
(there is no reason)
For you to hide
Only love can change your life
Only love can change your life

Every day you hold on to your lonely broken heart
It's tearing you apart
God is calling out to you just let healing star
Will you open up and let Him in?

You decide
(Who will you run to)
Wrong or right
(there is no reason)
For you to hide
Only love can change your life
You decide
You decide"
