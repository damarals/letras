"1" "Rain Down
Hillsong United

Looks like tonight, the sky is heavy
Feels like the wind are gonna change
Beneath my feet, the earth is ready
I know it’s time for Heaven’s rain
It’s gonna rain

‘Cos it’s living water we desire
To flood our hearts with Holy Fire

Rain down
All around the world we’re singing
Rain down
Can you hear the earth is singing?
Rain down
My heart is dry but I’m still singing
Rain down
Rain it down on me

Back to the start my heart is heavy
Feels like it’s time to dream again
I see the clouds, and yes I’m ready
To dance upon this barren land
Hope in my hands

Do not shut, do not shut,
Do not shut the heavens
But open up, open up,
Open up our hearts

Give me strength to cross the water
Keep my heart upon Your altar
Give me strength to cross this water
Keep my feet don’t let me falter"
