Switchfoot

Four A.M., two hours to go
I'm wearing out a lonely glow
I miss you more than I could know
Here I am, here I am
Won't you get me?

I've got my hand in redemption's side
Whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside
And I'll come alive
Come Alive

With my fist down at your feet
I was running out of mysteries
Insecure and incomplete
Here I am, here I am,
Won't you get me?

I've got my hand in redemption's side
Whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside
And I'll come alive
Come Alive
Alive, come alive

My fears have worn me out
My fears have worn me out, yeah
My fears have worn me out
My fears have worn me, worn me out

I've got my hand in redemption's side
Whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside
And I'll come alive (I've got my hand)
In redemption's side (whose scars)
Are bigger than (are bigger than)
These doubts of mine
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside
And I'll come Alive
Come Alive"
