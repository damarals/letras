What phenomenomenomenomenomenon?
And it just can’t pit stop, y’all know?
It’s one phenomenomenomenomenomenon?
And it just can’t pit stop, y’all
What phenomenomenomenomenomenon?
And it just can’t pit stop, y’all know?
What phenomenomenomenomenomenon?
And it just can’t pit stop…

We rock forever, we stop whenever
We rock forever, we stop whenever
We die whenever, we live forever
Y’all know? It’s a phenomenon that can’t be stopped!
Forever, we stop whenever
We rock forever, we stop whenever
We die whenever, we live forever
Y’all know? It’s a phenomenon that can’t be stopped now!

(Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody) Everybody out of the way
It’s monumental at the end of the day
So come what may
But it’s a wonder that will never fade
A marvel that will tickle the mind
It’s unaccountable in actual time
But when we’re free
They will see what we were destined to be (echo)

We rock forever, we stop whenever
We rock forever, we stop whenever
We die whenever, we live forever
Y’all know? It’s a phenomenon that can’t be stopped!
Forever, we stop whenever
We rock forever, we stop whenever
We die whenever, we live together
Y’all know? It’s a phenomenon that can’t be stopped now!

Well I’m alive and I’m enjoyin’ the ride
But livin’ for the moment I die
'Cause when I’m done, we will run eternally as one [echo]
My soul is up, up and away
My body dead right where it lays
I’m movin’ on going gone into the new beyond [echo]

We rock forever, we stop whenever
We rock forever, we stop whenever
We die whenever, we live forever
Y’all know? It’s a phenomenon that can’t be stopped!
Forever, we stop whenever
We rock forever, we stop whenever
We die whenever, we live together
Y’all know? It’s a phenomenon that can’t be stopped now!

This is the drama here’s the drama you’ve been waiting for
A new dimension that is yours to explore (to explore)
Such mystery is looming at your door
This is the moment [yell] I’ve been praying for [Echo]

What phenomenomenomenomenomenon?
And it just can’t pit stop, y’all know?
It’s one phenomenomenomenomenomenon?
And it just can’t pit stop, y’all
What phenomenomenomenomenomenon?
And it just can’t pit stop, y’all know?
What phenomenomenomenomenomenon?
And it just can’t pit stop…

We rock forever, we stop whenever
