"1" "You Are The Light
Vineyard

There is nothing that compares
With the joy of knowing You
Jesus You are all I need
I will bow down to worship

You You're the light
That shines in the darkness
You strengthen my weakness
When You shine on me
It's Your love as pure as the snow
Its life to my soul
And it's changing me

Everyday I walk with
You You're the rock that sees me through
Jesus all I have is Yours
With everything now I worship You

I belong to You, I belong to You

How I love You, how I love You
I'm in love with You"
