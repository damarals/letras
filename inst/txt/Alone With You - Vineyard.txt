"1" "Alone With You
Vineyard

I can see You, You can touch me
I can feel You
When I am alone with You
Alone with You

I can be me, You can free me
I can know You
When I am alone with You
Alone with You

You are everything to me
(You are everything to me)
And in Your presence I'm complete

(There's nowhere else I'ld rather be)
Than in this place alone with You
(There's nothing else I'ld rather do)

Than be alone with You"
