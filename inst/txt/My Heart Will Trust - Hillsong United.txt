"1" "My Heart Will Trust
Hillsong United

I'll walk closer now on the higher way
Through the darkest night will you hold my hand
Jesus guide my way

O you mourn with me and you dance with me
For my heart of hearts is bound to you

Though I walk through valleys low
I'll fear no evil
By the waters still my soul,
My heart will trust in You

O You counsel me and You comfort me
When I cannot see,
You light my path

My heart will trust in you"
