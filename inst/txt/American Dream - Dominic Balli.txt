"x"
"1" "American Dream
Dominic Balli

I was just a boy when they told me
What you gonna be and they sold me
The American Dream for a small fee
The price of my life and my own dreams
What about a dream where the Kingdom comes
Peace on the earth and his will be done
What about a dream where the people fight
Not for fortune and fame but for saving lives

She'll consume your future
If you just let her be
Hold the world a hostage
From sea to shining sea
You can call her freedom
But she can't set you free
And don't you dare disgrace her
She's our American dream

Chorus I
I was never told that the high life
Would demand my soul such a high price
I've been drinking the Kool-Aid the whole time
Believing the dream till it stole mine
What about a dream where the people cry
For the healing of a land both soul and mind
What about a dream where the dream was changed
Not for change sake but for the highest gain

They say cash rules everything around me it seems
For thirty pieces of silver you can buy you a king
And forfeit your soul become a slave to the machine
Some would sell they're own momma for the American pipe dream
Redemption disregarded to the good news imparted
Exempt from consequence spiritual free-dumb to free-tarded
Morally decayed selfish in my ways
I live to get paid I'm so American made

Chorus II
American Dream (America the American Dream)
American Dream (America my American Dream)
American Dream (America the American Dream)
American Dream (What does it cost for my American Dream)

Program me then program the future
Program schools and program the teachers
Program youth then program the future
Then program me to think I can lose her
Trap me hold me mind and my body
Teach my feet to walk like Zombie
Consume my life with the dollar sign
Till I pledge my allegiance to lose my mind

Chorus II
American Dream (America the American Dream)
American Dream (America my American Dream)
American Dream (America the American Dream)
American Dream (What does it cost for my American Dream)"
