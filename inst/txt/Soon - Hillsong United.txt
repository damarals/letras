VERSE 1:
Soon and very soon
My King is coming
Robed in righteousness
And crowned with love
When I see Him I shall be made like
Him Soon and very soon

VERSE 2:
Soon and very soon
I'll be going To the place
He has prepared for me
There my sin erased My shame forgotten
Soon and very soon

CHORUS:
I will be with the One I love
With unveiled face I'll see Him
There my soul will be satisfied
Soon and very soon

VERSE 3:
Soon and very soon See the procession
The angels and the elders 'Round the throne
At His feet I'll lay my crowns
My worship Soon and very soon

BRIDGE:
Though I have not seen Him
My heart knows Him well
Jesus Christ the Lamb
The Lord of heaven"
