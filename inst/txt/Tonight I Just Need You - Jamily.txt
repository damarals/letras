"1" "Tonight I Just Need You
Jamily

My heart is broken seems time has frozen
It seems so hard to recover
The room is empty walls falling down
I think the night won't be over my heart
Is broken seems time has frozen
Is seems so hard to recover
The room is empty walls falling down
I think the night won't be over

Tonight I just need you tonight
I just need you tonight I just need you
Tonight I don't wanna go anywhere without you
Don't wanna go anywhere without you

I found the way I found the hope
I see the light of the world now I
Can feel you now I can see you
I don't want the night to be over
I found the way I found my hope
I see the light of the world now
I can feel you now I can see you
I don't want the night to be over

Tonight I just need you tonight
I just need you tonight
I just need you tonight
I don't wanna go anywhere without you
Don't wanna go anywhere without you

Tonight I just need you tonight
I just need you tonight
I just need you tonight I don't
Wanna go anywhere without you
Go anywhere without you"
