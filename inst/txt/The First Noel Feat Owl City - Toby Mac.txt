"1" "The First Noel (Feat. Owl City)
Toby Mac

Born is the king, born is the king

The first noel, the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter’s night that was so deep

Born is the king, born is the king

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the king of israel
Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the king of israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Born is the king, born is the king

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the king of israel
Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the king of israel

The love you shared, even scared
Oh, the shepherds they were so afraid
You flipped it all on that very first christmas day
So I’ma yell noel on the streets like a newsie
And sing emmanuel ‘til this earth gotta lose me

Born is the king, born is the king

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the king of israel
Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the king of israel

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the king of israel
Noel, noel, noel
Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the king of israel
Noel, noel, noel"
