"1" "Love Is In The House
Toby Mac

I clear my throat before I grab the mic
I need uno momento
Them cynics gonna ride me like a pinto
No resentment do you comprehend my innuendo
You still can't leave the party til you drop your crucial info
Am I jaded in assuming that you're simply bound to do me
Like them other lyricists who's message ain't so gloomy
Pan my positively cause love has let you down
Man if you tasted the love I tasted
You'd be makin' sweeter sounds...too
Government checks, they flex with no dollars
Two turntables and a plate full of collards
Royalty checks we flex with few dollars
But my DJ makes the people wanna holler
CHORUS
Love is in the house, and the house is packed
So much soul I left the back door cracked
Mamma always said it's a matter of fact
When love is in the house the house is packed
Love is in the house, and the house is packed
So much soul I left the back door cracked
Daddy always said that I wish I was black
Love is in the house and the house is packed
Packed like a baby nine months in the womb
Man it was packed like a closet full of Nike's in my room
Singin' Oh sweet Lord take me to the next level
Where the love's much thicker than the stares of my devils
So whether or not this is a dream or reality
Let me appeal to the graces of His majesty
Amazing it will be when this tree bears life
My roots run to the river and the Giver of Life
Government checks, they flex in big dollars
Two palm pilots and a room full of ballers
Royalty checks we flex with few dollars
But amazing grace makes the people wanna holler
I Woke up this morning, didn't know what to do
There were people all around me tellin' me to sing the blues
They said Ain't seen no happy since 1992"
