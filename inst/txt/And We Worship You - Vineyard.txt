"1" "And We Worship You
Vineyard

You are the prince of peace
Author of love and grace
You are deserving of all our praise
We come in humility causing us to receive
Healing our deepest needs,
Touching our hearts

Chorus:
And we worship You we exalt You
Redeemer, Messiah the holy One
And we worship You we exalt You
Your kingdom is living right in our hearts
Your kingdom is living right in our hearts"
