"1" "I Wanna Say Thank You
Youthful Praise

Verse 1
If I never live another day
If I never see another smiling face
If I never breathe another breath or take
Another step I want to say Thank You

Verse 2
If I never hear what's to be heard
If I never speak another word
If I never see another sight or taste another bite
I want to say Thank you

Chorus
Thank you for all that you've done thus far
Thank you for being the God that you are
Thank you for food on my table I know that
You are able, I wanna say Thank you

Verse 3
If I never take another walk
If I never have another talk
If I never hear another voice or make another choice
I wanna say thank you

Verse 4
If I never scale a china wall or take a flight out
And got see the Taj Mahal
If I never find a special friend, If I never search the world
Over and back again Lord I wanna say Thank you

Chorus

Vamp
Thank you for food on my table
Thank you for making a way
Thank you for watching over me"
