"1" "As I Am
Ricardo Sá

When IÂ’m tired, I canÂ’t do a thing
And when I wanna cry, Â‘coz of my pain
You look at me and you gimme your hands
So I find out that

In your arms You take me away,
In your heart I find my refuge
In your eyes I can see my truth
I know that you love me as I am

When IÂ’m alone, and thereÂ’s nothing right
When IÂ’m felling down, tears in my eyes
You look at me and you gimme your hands
So I find out that

In your arms You take me away,
In your heart I find my refuge
In your eyes I can see my truth
I know that you love me as I am

Now I know that everything is just a choice
IÂ’ll surrender all my life into your heart
So I beg you, oh Lord
Hold my hands"
