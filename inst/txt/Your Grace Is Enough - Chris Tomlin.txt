"1" "Your Grace Is Enough
Chris Tomlin

Great is your faithfulness oh God
You wrestle with the sinner's heart
You lead us by still waters into mercy
And nothing can keep us apart

Pre Chorus:
So remember your people
Remember your children
Remember your promise, oh God

Chorus:
Your grace is enough.
Your grace is enough.
Your grace is enough.
Your grace is enough for me.

Verse 2:
Great is your love and justice God.
You use the weak to lead the strong.
You lead us in the song of your salvation
And all your people sing along.

Pre Chorus:
So remember your people.
Remember your children.
Remember your promise, oh God.

Chorus x3

Chorus 2:
Your Grace is enough
Heaven reaching down to us
Your Grace is enough for me

God, I see your grace is enough
I'm covered in your love
Your grace is enough for me

For me"
