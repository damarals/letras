Oh your people are dancing
Oh singing and shouting
To the one who is worthy
Oh you are worthy
We call upon your name
To inhabit all our praise

You are worthy

Rejoice, Rejoice
Let our praises resound
Lift up your voice
For His grace we have found
Rejoice, Rejoice
That His love may abound
Lift up your voice
Let the nations sing out

Oh we give this offering
To Almighty God our King
Oh we're gonna rise and sing
