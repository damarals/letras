"1" "Out in the Open
Amy Grant

They were the sweetest words I'd ever heard
My heart could barely take it in
Like water offered to the lips
Of a tired and thirsty man

Cuz it's a tangled web of woven
I don't know all the reasons
But it amazes me to wake up
To your mercy every morning

So I'm standing here spinning around
In the fields of freedom
And I'm still alive and reaching out
And I can feel the healing

Cuz you say
Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Out in the open
Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Into the light
There is no jury
There is no judge
Ready and waiting
Are the steady arms of love 124

For the sake of never making waves I
Kept my secrets to myself
And no one ever really knew the
Darker shadows of my heart

But I will be a witness
That there's nothing in me dark enough
The power of forgiveness
Cannot resuce from the deep

So I'm standing here spinning around
In the fields of freedom
And I'm still alive and reaching out
And I can feel the healing

And you say
Come on out come out
Come on out come out
Out in the open
Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Into the light
There is no jury
There is no judge
Ready and waiting
Are a steady arms of love 240

Hey

And I'm standing here spinning around
In the fields of freedom
And I'm still alive
And reaching out
And I can feel the healing

Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Out in the open
Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Into the light
There is no jury
There is no judge
Ready and waiting
Are the steady arms of love

Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Out in the open
Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Into the light

Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Into the arms of love
Into the light

Come on out come on out
Come on out come on out
Into the light"
