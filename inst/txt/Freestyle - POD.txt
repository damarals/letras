P.O.D.

Kids coming up from the alleys not like the valleys
Southtown San Diego rats out here in Cali
So Cal with the crew to show 'em how
you like me now, with the sound straight underground
Putt'n it down, lift up this jewel that i have found
and pass it around, flowing against the crowd
hip-hop hardknox rhy'm soon as the tune drops
negative small talks, homie start kick'n rocks
and take it down the blocks where it belongs
a demo of songs but they wouldn't put me on
thought i was gone, too late, but who's to say
my pockets are empty and i got dues to pay

(B section)
to the tic toc you don't stop
to the tic toc you don't quit, hit it
(Chorus)
Freestyle, freak with the flava it's sure the shot
floss up the Ave. when the shot gets hot
still pay'n dues and knock 'em out the box

that's how it is homie like it or not
it's bad enough late bills keep stacking up
no one ever told me that it would cost this much
so buckle up and come along for the ride
catching the vibes nd staying true to my tribe
i got mad love for the ones that still around
knew you'd be down from the get-go here and now
you make me proud from the diapers to the grave
no masquerade, stayed the same like in the day
one day when we all get saved
we're gonna change the world no matter what they say
and stay real playing what we feel
i'll keep praying for you while you shoot to thrill

(B section)
(Chorus)

(Bridge)
it's been a long time
it's been a long time com'n
hated by many and loved by less
hold the thresh, resurrected here in the West
clinch the fist; dismiss the stereotype myths
loose lips sink ships, then plead the fifth
you hated this, no reason you hated this
if you only knew you'd be the first to enlist
we come in love cause its just how we does
fit the frame staying the same as it ever was

(B section)
