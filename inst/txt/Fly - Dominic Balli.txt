"1" "Fly
Dominic Balli

I believed in you from the very start
No doubt that you a shooting star
Going places
Among the greatest
You could soar just like a rocket you
Could change the world if you wanted to
Little lady
It's not a maybe
You don't need no helicopters
Hot air balloons or fancy charters

Just spread your wings
And free your mind (Ey-ah)
You can ditch dem concrete kicks
And reach for the satellites
Ahead? s only friendly skies
And baby you were meant to fly
Baby you were meant to fly
Baby you were meant to fly
Baby you were meant to fly

Sinatra said come fly with me
But Lennon called it Lsd
Now truly
Who needs Lucy
Columbus and his ocean blue
And Armstrong with that big? ole moon
Yah they cool
But they got nothing on you

Up up up and away you go
Up up and away you go
Up up up and away you go"
