"1" "If You Could See Me Now
P.O.D.

My soul is alive, and so are you
Helps when trying to pass the time, it ain't easy without you
As long as I can try, I'll make it through
But it might take awhile, believe me if you only knew

If you, If you, Could see Me Now
If you, If you, Could see Me Now
If only you, If you, Could see Me Now

And is this what you want for me to feel?
Or am I going out of my mind? What Is real?
Stay by my side, so I can live
And I will be alright, don't leave me

If you, If you, Could see Me Now
If you, If you, Could see Me Now
If you, If you, Could see Me Now
If only you, If you, Could see Me Now
(Then you'd understand who I really am)
If only you, If you, Could see Me Now
(You never questioned me, if you could only see)

And is this what you want for me to feel?
And Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?
Is this what you need?
Is this what you want?
Is this what you need?

If you, If you, Could see Me Now (If I could see you!)
If you, If you, Could see Me Now (If I could see you!)
If only you, If you, Could see Me Now (If I could see you!)
(Then you'd understand who I really am)
If you, If you, Could see Me Now (If I could see you!)
(You never questioned me, if you could only see)"
