"1" "Carry Me Away
Vineyard

Holy Spirit I have come to seek You
To feel Your prescence, to lose myself in You
Oh River of Life
Come and carry me, carry me away
Holy Spirit I have come to meet You
To see Your glory, to clothe myself in You
And like a child, oh You carry me

Carry me away, away
Carry me away
Away, away, away

Waves of ecstasy washing over me
Love everlasting You are surrounding me
And deep cries out to deep

Carry me away"
