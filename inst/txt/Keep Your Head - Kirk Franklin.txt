"x"
"1" "Keep Your Head
Kirk Franklin

(Verse)
I look in your eyes, I know your fight
I feel your trouble waiting in line
Praying this time, life won't pass you by
In the news another one dies, tell me what do you do

Negativity pulling me down, I can't stay down
I wish I could make it go away
Wish I could find the right words to say
I'm calling you please, Jesus I need to hear a word from you

I gotta know that there's more to this life than what I can see
And wanna feel how it feels to know real love and see me happy
Have a faith that can say to a storm \"you're
temporary\"
I wanna be free, If you wanna be free

(Chorus)
[Keep your head to the Sky]
I'm keeping my eyes on you

You gotta come through, cause You promised me
[Keep your head to the Sky]
can hardly wait til You come
?Cause You're the one my heart's been waiting for

I look in your eyes, I know your fight
I feel your trouble waiting in line
Praying this time, life won't pass you by
In the news another one dies, tell me what do you do

Negativity pulling me down, I can't stay down
I wish I could make it go away
Wish I could find the right words to say
I'm calling You please, Jesus I need to hear a word from You

I gotta know that there's more to this life than what I can see
And wanna feel how it feels to know real love and see me happy
Have a faith that can say to a storm \"you're
temporary\"
I wanna be free, If you wanna be free

(Chorus)
[Keep your head to the Sky]
I'm keeping my eyes on you

You gotta come through, cause You promised me
[Keep your head to the Sky]
can hardly wait til You come
?Cause You're the one my heart's been waiting for

(Breakdown)
Clap your hands ya'll, all my people can you clap your hands
Let me hear you say
If you know that things have gotta change, say
That nothing grows without a little rain, say
That no matter what they tell ya God is waiting and
He's listening
Don't look back, ?cause it gets better say

If you're blessed to have healthy kids say,
If you're blessed to have a place to live say,
Stop chasin' after everything you see
Might not have everything you want, but you have
everything you need

(Chorus)
[Keep your head to the Sky]
I'm keeping my eyes on you

You gotta come through, cause You promised me
[Keep your head to the Sky]"
