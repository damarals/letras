"1" "Bring On The Holidays
Toby Mac

Come on baby, let's not fight
I'm gonna catch the early flight
Before our streets are dressed in white

I'll be there
And please don't decorate the tree
Have a little heart and wait for me
I love that night especially
I'll be there

'cause this is the season I love
Yeah, this is the season for love

I love the holidays
Never too far away
'cause no matter where I go
I find my way back home
So happy holidays
O happy holidays

'cause this is the season I love
Yeah, I still believe in, in love

So come on baby, let's not fight
It's christmas eve tomorrow night
Before the streets are dressed in white
I'll be there
To celebrate our savior's birth
And we will pray for peace on earth
It's christmas all around the world

Oh, I love the holidays
No matter where I go
Baby, I'm coming home
Bring on the holidays
Never too far away
'cause no matter where I go
I find my way back home
So happy holidays
Bring on the holidays"
