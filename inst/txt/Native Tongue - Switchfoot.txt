Switchfoot

Sing to me, baby, in your native tongue
Sing the words of the wise and the young
Show me the place where your words come from
Love's the language
Love is your native tongue

Feel your heartbeat bang the drums
Open up your eyes and fill your lungs
The same word from where the stars were flung
Love's the language
Love is your native tongue

My heart Is a beating drum
My head In oblivion
My soul Such a long way from
My lips, my lungs, my native tongue

My friend Where did we go wrong?
My lord, We forgot our song
My soul, Such a long way from
My lips, my lungs, my native tongue

Sing it to me, whisper into my ear
Accusers voices start to disappear
In the wind in the tongues of the flame
In my soul, in my one true name
Back before we learned the words to start a fight
Back before they told us that the haters were right
You spoke the truth, let there be and there was
Love's the language
Love is your native tongue

So sing it out, get loud
Louder than the voices in the crowd
Even when they try to drown you out
Your lips, your lungs, your native tongue
Sing it out, get loud
Louder than the darkness and the doubts
Louder than the curses and the shouts
Your lips, your lungs, your native tongue
I want the world to sing in her native tongue
To sing it like when we were young
Back before the pendulum had swung to the shadows
I want the world to sing in her native tongue
Maybe we could learn to sing along
To find a way to use our lungs for love and not the shadows"
