"1" "Thank You For The Change
Youthful Praise

I don't know where I'd be without the Lord
Without Him there would be no me
He came in, turned my life around
Gave me total victory
I am just so glad about it
Makes me feel like singing and shouting
I can't help but lift up my hands
Or even break out in a dance

'Cause when I think of what I was before Him
I know that I would be lost without Him
So I can't help but say hallelujah
Can't help but give Him praise
'Cause He's done what no one else
Could do for me

He changed my life
Removed the pain and strife
He broke the chains
That were binding me

So when I think of what I was before Him
I know that I would be lost without Him
So I can't help but say hallelujah
Can't help but give Him praise
'Cause He's done what no one else
Could do for me

Lead
I wanna say thank You for the change in me
Oh, thank You for the change in me

Choir
Thank You for the change You made in me
I thank You for the change You made in me

Thank You"
