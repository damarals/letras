Vineyard

You've had mercy on me
According to Your love
You've made a blind eye see
And now I'm looking above

Friend of the weak, You lifted me up
From down on my knees
Crying for Your love You came to me

And I'm singing of Your love
In the shadows of Your wings
I'm hiding in Your love
In the shadows of Your wings

You gave a new song to me
And You won me with Your blood
And though I'll never repay this love
You give to me
I wanna show it to all the world"
