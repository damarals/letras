Switchfoot

There's always something in the way
There's always something getting through,
but it's not me
It's You
It's You

Sometimes ignorance rings true,
but hope is not in what I know,
not in me
It's in You
It's in You

It's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know

I find peace when I'm confused
I find hope when I'm let down,
not in me
It's in You
It's in You

I hope to lose myself for good
I hope to find it in the end
not in me
In You
In You

It's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know
In You
In You
It's in You
In You

There's always something in the way
There's always something getting thorugh,
but it's not me
it's You
it's You
it's You....
(It's all I know)"
