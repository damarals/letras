Newsboys

In this time of desperation
When all we know is doubt and fear
There is only one salvation
We believe, we believe

In this broken generation
When all is dark You help us see
There is only one foundation
We believe, we believe

We believe in God the Father
We believe in Jesus Christ
We believe in the Holy Spirit
And He's given us new life
We believe in the Crucifixion
We believe that He conquered death
We believe in the resurrection
And He's coming back again
We believe

So, let our faith be more than anthems
Greater than the songs we sing
And in our weakness and temptations
We believe, we believe

We believe in God the Father
We believe in Jesus Christ
We believe in the Holy Spirit
And He's given us new life
We believe in the Crucifixion
We believe that He conquered death
We believe in the resurrection
And He's coming back again
We believe


Let the lost be found
And the dead be raised
In the here and now
Let love invade
Let the church live loud
Our God we'll say
We believe, we believe
And the gates of Hell
Will not prevail
For the power of God
Has torn the veil
Now we know Your love
Will never fail
We believe, we believe

We believe in God the Father
We believe in Jesus Christ
We believe in the Holy Spirit
And He's given us new life
We believe in the Crucifixion
We believe that He conquered death
We believe in the resurrection
And He's coming back
He's coming back again
We believe We believe"
