Third Day

I've been sitting here for way too long
It's time that I was moving on
I know that there's a better way
I think I'm going to make a change
So come along now to where I'm going

Take me to the otherside
'Cause I need something better
Take me to the otherside
'Cause I want to live forever

One thing that's for sure I know
This won't be an easy road
Let me ask before I leave
Won't you come along with me

So come along now to where I'm going
Come along now to where I'm going

Take me to the other side
Take me to the other side
Take me to the other side
'Cause I want to live forever
Live forever
Take me to the other side"
