"1" "Lost The Plot
Newsboys

When you're coming back again
would you bring me something from the fridge?
Heard the rumor that the end is near
but I just got comfortable here.

sigh
let's be blunt
I'm a little distracted
What do you want?

Headaches and bad faith
they're all that I got
first I misplaced the ending
then I lost the plot

Long among the free-ranged sheep
where the big birds sharpen their claws
for the time we stuck with the shepherd
but you wouldn't play Santa Claus

sigh
let's be blunt
We're a little distracted
What do you want?

Once we could follow
now we cannot
You would not fit our image
so we lost the plot

Once we could hear you
now our senses are shut
We've forgotten our first love
we have lost the plot
lost the plot

When I saw you for the first time
you were hanging with a thief
and I saw my hands were dirty
so I dropped my gaze
but you said I was forgiven
and you welcomed me with laughter
I was happy ever after
and I was counting the days
When you're coming back again
I'll be ready for you
When you're coming back again
We'll be waiting for you
Maybe we will wake up when
Maybe we will wake up when
You are coming back again

lies
let's be blunt
We're a little unfaithful
What do you want?

Are you still listening?
'Cause obviously we're not
We've forgotten our first love
We have lost the plot

And why are you still calling?
You forgave, we forgot
We're such experts at stalling
we have lost the plot
lost the plot
lost the plot
lost the plot

When you're coming back again
would you bring me something from the fridge?
Heard the rumor that the end is near
but I just got comfortable here...
