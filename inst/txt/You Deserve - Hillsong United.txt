Hillsong United

What is this love
Given to us
Received my life
For selfless sacrifice
Although we fail
The cross prevails
Forgiveness stands
You've taken me back again

You've shown me life
You’ve opened my eyes
So I give you my praise
Yeah I give you my all
You've shown me life
You’ve opened my eyes
To the truth that
There’s no greater love

Now in the darkness
God’s light shines
Christ forever glorified
So come on come on
Sing out to God
Now with all we’ve got
We live for you are God

Salvation’s strong, in Christ alone
The savior king alone in the victory
I step aside, Give You my life
For You to know to watch in all we do

I can’t imagine a life without you without you
‘Cause it’s all for You
Yeah it’s all for You
God"
