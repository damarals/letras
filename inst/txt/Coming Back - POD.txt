"1" "Coming Back
P.O.D.

He's coming back
He's coming back for me and you
3x

It's the low down, the showdown, brothers ready to
throw down
No need for us to go down, the Truth is what we know
now
That we have we have life through my Lord, Christ
Jesus
No one can love you more than to do the things that
He
did
So give Him your pass so that He can start to mold ya

Full fledged, dedicated, hardcore, christian soldier
Spiritual war, it's a spiritual bout
and we're the first ones in P.O.D. and we're the last
ones out

He's coming back
He's coming back for me and you"
