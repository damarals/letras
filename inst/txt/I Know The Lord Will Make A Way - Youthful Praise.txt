I Know The Lord Will Make A Way
As sung by Smokie Norful

I know the Lord will make a way
Yes He will
I know the Lord will make a way
Yes He will
He'll make a wy for you
He will lead you safely through
I know the Lord will make a way
Yes He will
I have a Savior who I can tell all my troubles to
When I'm burdened and don't know what to do
I can go to Him in secret prayer
And I can leave all my burdens there
I know the Lord will make a way
Yes He will (9xs)
When I was sick and couldn't get well
He healed my body now I can tell
I know the Lord will make a way
Yes He will
Oh yes He will
When through the storm you're tossed about
I know the Lord,
He'll bring you out
I know the Lord will make a way
Oh yes He will"
