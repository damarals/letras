"1" "Above All Others
Vineyard

Lord, Your glory fills my heart,
Your presence deep within me stirs my soul.
Oh Lord, how awesome are Your ways,
Your majesty surrounding all the earth.

All wisdom and honor and glory forever,
All power and greatness and splendor,
They are Yours above all others,
My Lord.

Lord, Your spirit moves in me now,
I see a picture of Your holiness.
Oh Lord, I look into Your eyes,
And feel a fire burn into my heart."
