"1" "Be The One
Jeremy Camp

And all these dreams I've made
I take them all and lay them down
In light of reasons I have found now

And I can rest in knowing
You will open every door
Instead of forcing my own world now

I'd rather wait on you

Refrão:
You'll be the one to call me out
I have found that it's the only way
You'll be the one to call me out
I have found that it's the only way

I know that I have plans
But you will take me
Every step you have covered all my debt now

And I have realized these empty fames
That people crave are based on hopes of what they've made now
I'd rather wait on you

(Refrão)

There's more than what I'm feeling, well
There's more than what I'm feeling

(Refrão)"
