"1" "Lord Of The Heavens
Hillsong United

Lord of the heavens and the earth
My Saviour, Redeemer, risen Lord
All honour and glory, power and strength
To Him upon the throne

Holy, holy, You are worthy
Praises to the Son of God
Jesus, You alone are worthy
Crowned in righteousness and peace

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Praises to the Great I Am
Hosanna, join with angels singing
Worthy is the Lamb of God"
