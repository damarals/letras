Jimmy Needham

The Gospel, the Gospel
Fragrance in words
The sea of my soul
Is calmed when it's heard

Peace to the broken
The captives set free
May the Gospel of Jesus
Wash over me

The Gospel, the Gospel
My freedom explained
No more shall these garments
I'm wearing be stained

The old man is missing
The new man is free
May the Gospel of Jesus

Wash over me
Wash over me
Wash over me
And come make me clean
Wash

I will be free
I will be clean

The Gospel, the Gospel
She's good and she's true
She cost quite a fortune

To make all things new
So breathe in with faith
And out with his peace

May the Gospel of Jesus
May the Gospel of Jesus
May the Gospel of Jesus

Wash over me
Wash over me
Wash over me
And come make me clean
Wash"
