"x"
"1" "Matter of Time
Michael W. Smith

If I could I would tell you why
The first time I saw her I could touch the sky
I turned to stone...and I could not speak
She had teh ability to make me weak

Chorus-
Always wishing...always hoping
That she'll get the message from the
Bottom of my heart
Let's together...share forever
It's just matter of time

I had to wait and just let her breathe
That's never been easy for a man to see
She moved slow...and she took her time
She kept me guessing what was on her mind

Chorus

It's just a matter of time
Let's forever...be together
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
