"1" "The Moment #2
Kirk Franklin

My Savior, my King
You're my protection
My eyes, my direction
A friend that is true
My Savior, my King
My stronghold, my keeper
My body grows weak but
I find strength in You
My Savior, my King
My poor heart You mended
I surrender my
Yes, I do
Oh, the veil you have ended
The sweetest name, dear to me
It will forever be
Clothed in majesty
Let eternity see that

He was wounded for my transgressions
And He was bruised for my iniquities
The chastisement of our peace was upon Him
And by His stripes
We are healed
Oooh, by his stripes
We are healed

Oooh, I am healed from sin, sick diseases (diseases)
Oh, I'm healed from pain and sorrow (sorrow)
Oh, I'm healed from all life's heartbreaks and heartaches
Oh, we are, yes, we are healed
Oh, yes, yes, we are healed

[2x]

And I know it was the blood
I know it was the blood
I know it was the blood
For me
And one day, when I was lost
He died upon the cross
And do you know it was the blood
For me

By the blood (falling on us)
By the blood (it gives me purpose)
By the blood (You are for us)
By the blood (who can be against us)

I'm standing here because the blood of Jesus (falling on us)
That can wash away my sins (it gives me purpose)
Oh, by the blood, blood (You are for us)
By the blood (who can be against us)

It's the blood of Jesus(falling on us)
The blood of Jesus (it gives me purpose)
The blood of Jesus (You are for us)
The blood of Jesus (who can be against us)

Now, we are never alone
Your blood, it makes us strong
Now, there is power to move on
Never, we are never alone"
