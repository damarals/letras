"1" "Holy Spirit Fall On Me
Vineyard

Holy Spirit, fall on me,
Holy Spirit, wash me clean.
Holy Spirit, fall on me,
Holy Spirit, wash me clean.

And show me how long and how wide
Is the love of Christ?
How long and how wide is the love of Jesus Christ?
How long and how wide is the love of Christ?
How long and how wide is the love of Jesus Christ?

Jesus, rain on me.
Jesus, speak to me.
Jesus, reign in me,
Jesus, set me free."
