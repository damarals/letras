"1" "We Will Dance
Vineyard

Sing a song of celebration
Lift up a shout of praise
for the Bridegroom will come,
the glorious One
And Oh, we will look on His face
We'll go to a much better place

Dance with all your might
Lift up your hands and clap for joy
The time's drawing near,
when He will appear
And oh, we will stand by His side
A strong, pure, spotless bride

Chorus:
We will dance on the streets that are golden
The glorious bride and the great Son of man
From every tongue and tribe and nation
We'll join in the song of the Lamb

Sing aloud for the time of rejoicing is near
The risen King, our groom, is soon to appear
The wedding feast to come
Is now near at hand
Lift up your voice,
Proclaim the coming Lamb"
