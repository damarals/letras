"1" "Our God Is An Awesome God
Michael W. Smith

When He rolls up His sleeves
He ain't just putting on the ritz
Our God is an awesome God
There is thunder in His footsteps
And lightning in His fists
Our God is an awesome God
The Lord wasn't joking
When He kicked 'em out of Eden
It wasn't for no reason
That He shed His blood
His return is very close
And so you better be believing that
Our God is an awesome God

Chorus:
Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from Heaven above
With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God

And when the sky was starless
In the void of the night
Our God is an awesome God
He spoke into the darkness
And created the light
Our God is an awesome God
Judgment and wrath
He poured out on Sodom
Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
I hope that we have not
Too quickly forgotten that
Our God is an awesome God"
