"1" "I Will Love You
Catedral

Turn on the light
Look inside yourself
There's a place in the world for us
A chance that we never trust

Give me your hand
Feel the air tonight
I just want to be here with you
For the grace of God
I love you

Always,I will love you
And I know what I mean
My Lord gave to me
Forever my love is you"
