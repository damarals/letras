"1" "For Who You Are
Youthful Praise

VERSE I
Standing here in Your presence
Thinking of the good things You have done
Waiting here patiently
Just to hear Your still small voice again
Holy righteous faithful to the end
Saviour hero redeemer and friend
CHORUS
I will worship You for who You are
I will worship You for who You are
I will worship You for who You are Jesus
BRIDGE
My soul secure, Your promise sure
You're love endures always
My soul secure, Your promise sure
You're love endures always
My soul secure, Your promise sure
You're love endures always"
