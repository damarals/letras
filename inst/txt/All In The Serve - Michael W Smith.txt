"1" "All In The Serve
Michael W. Smith

Never gave you nothin’
People couldn’t explain away
Never gave you nothin’
Without something to gain
Never could slow down enough
To study a face, but now
I wanna know your name

Chorus:
Hold my feet to the fire
Till I’m breaking a sweat
Till I never forget
Your calling
Keep me on the line
Give me the nerve
Here it’s all in the serve

Locked in the diamond lane
I kept driving past it
Better to be safe than learn
What you’re about
Give me another chance
To go where you're going now
I’m here to walk it out
I’m here to walk it out
I’m here to walk it out

Chorus: (2x’s)

It’s all in the serve
It’s all in the serve
Here it’s all in the serve"
