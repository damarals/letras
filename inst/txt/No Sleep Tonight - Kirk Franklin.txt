"1" "No Sleep Tonight
Kirk Franklin

Oh that's the sound of love
Oh that's the sound of love

I just wanna get away with you
I just wanna fly away from what I see
Every time we fail it falls on you
Another reason for the world to not believe

See it don't feel right
When we hurt and lie
And we judge inside
Now love's been erased
You can try and hide
But no sleep tonight
Till we get this right
Let's talk about it

Let's talk about love, life, faith
patience, grace, forgiveness
If not, whose gonna sleep tonight?
'Cause I'm not right
If I kill your light that you have inside
Tell me how do we sleep tonight?
How do we sleep tonight?

I just wanna get away with you
To make sure everyone could see the God in me
After sunday we don't love like you
And how we treat each other is a mystery

See it don't feel right
When we hurt and lie
And we judge inside
Now love's been erased
You can try and hide
But no sleep tonight
Till we get this right
Let's talk about it

Let's talk about love, life, faith
patience, grace, forgiveness
If not, whose gonna sleep tonight?
'Cause I'm not right
If I kill your light that you have inside
Tell me how do we sleep tonight?

Can't close my eyes
Change me inside
Give us your light

Oh that's the sound of love
Oh that's the sound of love
When you have no words to pray
Your faith can't find a way
Oh brings you back to love

If I don't like my neighbor how can I love you?
Today is a new day so let's talk about it

Let's talk about love, life, faith
patience, grace, forgiveness
If not, whose gonna sleep tonight?
'Cause I'm not right
If I kill your light that you have inside
Tell me how do we sleep tonight?

Oh that's the sound of love
How do we sleep tonight?
Oh that's the sound of love
How do we sleep tonight
Oh that's the sound of love
How do we sleep tonight?
Oh brings you back to love

God so loved the world, that he gave his only son
Whosoever believeth in him
shall not perish, but have everlasting life
That's the sound of love"
