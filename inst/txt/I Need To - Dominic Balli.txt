"x"
"1" "I Need To
Dominic Balli

Everything I thought was true has left me
Everyone I thought I that knew has Abandoned me
Everything I thought I was called to has...
And everyone I thought I was bound to have...
Neglected me, rejected me, and left me...
With only You

I wanna find myself in You
I wanna find myself in You

I said everyone I thought were my friends have
just walked out on me
And the only life that I knew is...
well... just fantasy
What I once held so dear now shattered dreams
I can't see the road no more (nah)
I can't see my path no more (so)
If You don't mind... Can I follow You

I wanna find myself in You
I wanna find myself in You
I wanna find myself in You
I need to, I need to find myself in You

So I guess this means I was wrong,
The world just picked up and left it's gone
And when all is said and done
And everyone's gone home
And all the doors have closed
And every hope is gone
It's just you and me and a song
It's just you and me and a song
It's just you and me and a song

You are all I'll ever need in this life
You're the only thing I need to get by
You're the only one I need in this life
Only one, only one

You're the only road that I need to see
You're the only dream I need to dream
You satisfy my desire like a water spring
You make my world spin free
You're the only song that I sing Yeah

La de da da da
La de da da da... da"
