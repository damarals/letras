Mom and Dad,
I'm fine, how are you?
I have joined a small circus,
that much is true.

I'm a litte malnourished,
but try to relax,
could you find a better photo for the milk carton backs?
Send money...

Run away
Where's your head?
Dreamer's dreams
are grounded!

(chorus 1)
In reality that comes from above,
God is calling,
there's no bigger love,
it's his reality that welcomes us back,
trust and obey,
there is no other way...

Mom and Dad,
I'm fair, how's life?
Lent the money you sent me to a clown with a knife,
my career as an acrobat hasn't begun,
but I'm busy giving blood and shoveling elephant dung.
Send Money...

Run away
why not some tens?
Dreamer's dreams
will make sense...

(chorus 1)

Run Away!!
Blowing smoke,
Your folks are worried
and going broke
after the fall,
is a whole new episode,
Reality is a high road

(chorus 2)
In the Reality that comes from above,
God is calling,
there's no bigger love
his reality will welcome us back,
trust and obey, there is no other way!
x 3

In the reality that comes from above,
God is calling.
