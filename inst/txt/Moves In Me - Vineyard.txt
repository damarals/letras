"1" "Moves In Me
Vineyard

Messiah come
Love's ancient dream
Emmanuel's blood

Redemption stream
The human mind
Can't comprehend

The angels long to see
What the prophets knew
As mystery

Well it moves in me
Yeah He lives in me
The kingdom come

True justice reigns
The work is done
Now work by faith"
