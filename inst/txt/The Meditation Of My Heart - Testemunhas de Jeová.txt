"1" "The Meditation Of My Heart
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

The meditation of my heart
The thoughts I ponder through the day
May they be pleasing to you, lord
And keep me steadfast in your way

When worries weigh upon my mind
And make me restless in the night
Then may I meditate on you
And things I know to be upright

Whatever things are chaste and true
Whatever virtue there may be
Whatever things well-spoken of
May thoughts of these bring peace to me
How precious are your thoughts, o God!

Beyond all counting is their sum
So may I ponder your own words
Absorbed in them may I become"
