"1" "Marching To Zion
Youthful Praise

Come ye that love the Lord, and let your joys be known,
Join in a song with sweet accord, join in a song with sweet accord.
And thus surround the throne, and thus surround the throne.
We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion; the beautiful city of God
Then let our songs a bound and every tear be dry;
We're marching through immanuel's ground; we're marching through immanuel's
Ground,
To fairer worlds on high, to fairer worlds on high.
We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion; the beautiful city of God
We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion; the beautiful city of God"
