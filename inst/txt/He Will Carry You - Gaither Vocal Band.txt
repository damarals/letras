"1" "He Will Carry You
Gaither Vocal Band

There is no problem too big
God cannot solve it
There is no mountain too tall
He cannot move it
There is not storm too dark
God cannot calm it
There is no sorrow too deep
He cannot soothe

If He carried the weight of the world upon His shoulders
I know, my brother that He will carry you
If He carried the weight of the world upon His shoulders
I know, my sister that He will carry you

He said come on to me all who are weary
And I will give you rest"
