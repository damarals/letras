"1" "Your Kingdom Come
MercyMe

We long to sit at your feet
We long to see your face
We long to smell the rain of your anointing
We long to be in You
chorus
Hear our hearts oh hear our voice
To you oh God we will rejoice
We are your bride and we wear your ring
Until your return we will sing
That we long to see You
bridge
How much longer shall we wait
Till we finally see the sun
Break through the eastern gate
Let your kingdom come
Hallelujah to the Lamb (repeat)"
