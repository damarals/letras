Jeremy Camp

many times i take for granted
just what youve done for me
the heart in which youve planted
is precious for you to see

the cross in which youve hung
is not a plcae for a king to be
Lord the wounds that stung you did it all for, you did it all for me

youve always been so faithful
even when i dont deserve
Lord help me to be more greatful
of the love that you preserve

the cross in which youve hung
is not a plcae for a king to be
Lord the wounds that stung you did it all for, you did it all for me

help me to look into your gracious eyes
take the selfishness away from me

o yeah yeah he died for me (X2)
o yeah yeah

help me to look into your gracious eyes
take the selfishness away from me

he died for me"
