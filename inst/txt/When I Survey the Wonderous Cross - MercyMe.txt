"1" "When I Survey the Wonderous Cross
MercyMe

words: Isaac Watts music: Lowell Mason
verse
When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride
verse
Forbid it Lord that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ my God
All the vain things that charm me most
I sacrificed them to His blood
verse
See from Hid head His hands His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did ere such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown
verse
Were the whole realm of nature mine
that were a present far too small
Love so amazing so divine
Demands my soul my life my all
