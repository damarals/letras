"1" "Draw Me Close To You
Vineyard Brasil

I lay it all down again
To hear You say that I'm Your friend

You are my desire
No one else will do
Cause no one else can take Your place
To feel the warmth of Your embrace

Help me find the way Bring me back to You
You're all I want You're all I ever needed

You're all I want
Help me know You are near
Never let me go"
