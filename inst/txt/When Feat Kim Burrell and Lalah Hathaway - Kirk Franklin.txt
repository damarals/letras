"x"
"1" "When (Feat. Kim Burrell and Lalah Hathaway)
Kirk Franklin

Raindrops make suns the earthquakes and moans they
Both sing how long till the wedding day
Stars robed in white
Decorate the sky
While the fragile bride cries, \"take me away\"

Who can explain
These storms and these waves that
Echo birth planes please hear what they say
Mountains and trees every living thing
Shall tarry back please and do not delay

[Chorus:]
When will you come for your daughters and sons
We are homesick we try, but we don't belong
Even if that day's a million light years away
Each day will begin with the same question
When, when, when, when?

Creation speaks the winds through the leaves
It begs to be free no curses remain
Them in disease your people are weak
Help us to believe it could be any day

Great are the scars (great are the scars)
After each one (after each one)
Look close you'll see defeat on our face
Can't hear a sound
Your silence is loud
Come close to us now, you feel far away

[Chorus]

When, when
A billion hearts tonight are asking
When, when
You heard it before
We won't stop asking

But who am I
Even to try to understand ways much greater than mine

[Chorus]

When, when, when, when
When, when, when, when"
