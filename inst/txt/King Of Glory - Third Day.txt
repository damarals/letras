"1" "King Of Glory
Third Day

Who is this King of Glory
That pursues me with his love
And haunts me with each hearing
Of His softly spoken words
My conscience, a reminder
Of forgiveness that I need
Who is this King of Glory
Who offers it to me
Who is this King of Angels,
Oh blessed Prince of Peace
Revealing things of Heaven
And all its mysteries
My spirit's ever longing
For His grace in which to stand
Who's this King of Glory,
Son of God and son of man

Chorus:
His name is Jesus
Precious Jesus
The Lord Almighty
The King of my heart
The King of glory

Who is this King of Glory
With strength and majesty
And wisdom beyond measure
The gracious King of kings
The Lord of Earth and Heaven
The Creator of all things
He is the King of Glory
He's everything to me

Chorus

He is the King of Glory
He's everything to me

Chorus"
