"x"
"1" "Tin Roof
Chris Tomlin

Maybe the streets are golden
There's a table with plenty room
Maybe we don't grow old
And we got nothing to lose
Maybe in the promise land
There's a choir when you walk through
Oh, but I pray Heaven
is like rain on a tin roof
Maybe the sun don't set
And the waters don't rise
Maybe we don't forget
How to laugh like a child
Maybe in the promise land
We're all made for what we do
Oh, but I pray Heaven
is like rain on a tin roof

Washing away
Washing away my sorrows
Giving me faith
Giving me faith to follow a new tomorrow
They tell me in the promise land
There are mansions to choose
Oh, but I pray Heaven
is like rain on a tin roof

Maybe time stands still
And the mountains just move
Maybe we all have wings
And there's only good news
They say the living water
Is the fountain of youth
Oh, but I pray Heaven
is like rain on a tin roof

Washing away
Washing away my sorrows
Giving me faith
Giving me faith to follow a new tomorrow
They tell me in the promise land
There are mansions to choose
Oh, but I pray Heaven
is like rain on a tin roof
Washing away (Washing away)
Washing away my sorrows
Giving me faith (Giving me faith)
Giving me faith to follow a new tomorrow
Yeah, in the promise land
There are mansions for me and you
Oh, but I pray Heaven
is like rain on a tin roof
I pray Heaven
is like rain on a tin roof"
