"x"
"1" "Feel The Light
Britt Nicole

Today, today, you wanna run away now
You break, try to keep it together
Love, love is all you need
You're a queen but you're never known it
Life has come and left you blinded
Stole you smile and left you crying
It's not your fault, shame is all you've got now

Your heart's tangled up in silence
It's time to let go
Feel the light
I know it's easier to hide
But you gotta let go
Feel the light
Let go and feel the light

Brave, brave, the water's all around you
I' stay I'll keep you from sinking down
Love is on your side
It's stronger than you'll ever know

So many years of quiet
Building up like a fire inside
You're feeling like you gotta let it out now
Just let it out

Your heart's tangled up in silence
It's time to let go
Feel the light
I know it's easier to hide
But you gotta let go
Feel the light
Let go and feel the light

How did you get here
You're locked inside of all this fear
Inside you're crying out
Your mind's a war
Get out, get out and live for more
There's so much more
Live for more

Your heart's tangled up in silence
It's time to let go
Feel the light
I know it's easier to hide
But you gotta let go
Feel the light
Let go and feel the light

Brave, brave the water's all around you
I'll stay, I'll keep you from sinking down"
