"1" "Free To Fly
Vineyard

I've tasted of the Kingdom coming
It was sweet upon my lips
Sweet upon my lips
Though not yet in it's fullness
One day soon
It will take all tears away
Take all tears away

One day I will rise on the winds of heaven
With Your glory in my eyes
One day I will rise with the wings of an eagle
Doing circles in the sky
I'll be free to fly and sure to fall
Into Your arms

Your mercy has been my lifeline and even still
I am clinging to Your hand
Clinging to Your hand
How long 'til we reach the other side
And we wrestle here no more
Wrestle here no more"
