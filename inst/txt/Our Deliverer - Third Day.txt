"1" "Our Deliverer
Third Day

There is beauty rising from these ashes
There is new life in these dry bones
There's a revival flowing like a fountain
There's a new song waiting to be sung

Our deliverer is coming
Our deliverer is coming

Every burden one day will be lifted
Every broken heart will be redeemed
The lord almight is coming to our rescue
Salvation's waiting for all who will believe

Our deliverer is coming
With salvation in his wings
Our deliverer is coming
Here to set his people free
Our deliverer is coming
Coming back for you and me
Our deliverer is coming

Savior come to set us free
From the pain and suffering
Our deliverer is coming
We are waiting for the day when
Our deliverer is coming"
