"1" "It Can't Rain Everyday
P.O.D.

This little one tries as hard as she can
The only thing is for she can fit in
She wants a friend so bad
She'll do whatever they tell her
To make them smile she would misbehave
But all the while they were laugh in her face
She begins to cry because she thought that they liked her

Event though you feel alone
It can't rain everyday
It don't rain forever
The sunshine may be gone, but I know
It can't rain everyday
It don't rain forever

He works on everyday of his life
For his son on the way and his beautiful wife
But today he got a call from his job
They got something to tell him
It laid him off now he's out on the street
He's got to do what it takes so his family can eat
Can't even look at his wife
Cause he feels like he failed them

Event though you feel alone
It can't rain everyday
It don't rain forever
The sunshine may be gone, but I know
It can't rain everyday
It don't rain forever

It don't rain, it don't rain forever
It can't rain, it don't rain forever
Hold me down
Rain down(5X)
Rain down on me now

The young lady has been lost for a while
But that's ok now she's having a child
She finally got what she want
She's got someone who loves her
Well this morning she woke up in pain
Her body had to tell her 'cause she knew right away
So she started to cry 'cause she won't be a mother

Event though you feel alone
It can't rain everyday
It don't rain forever
The sunshine may be gone, but I know
It can't rain everyday
It don't rain forever

It don't rain, it don't rain forever
It can't rain, it don't rain forever
Wait now
Rain now
Rain now on me"
