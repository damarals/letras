"1" "The Way
Michael W. Smith

From the tears and the pain and the fears and the rain.
From the dark to the light you were once shining bright.
From the tears and the pain and the fears and the rain.
From the dark to the light you were once shining bright.

Put your hand in my hand.
Put your hand in my hand.
Put your hand in my hand.
Put your hand in my hand.
Let me show you the way.
Put your hand in my hand.
Let me show you the way, and you will understand.
I will show you the way.

From the tears and the pain and the fears and the rain.
I'll take you.
From the dark to the light we were once shining bright.
I'll take you.

Put your hand in my hand, let me show you the way.
And you will understand, I will show you the way.

From the tears and the pain and the fears and the rain.
I'll take you.
From the dark to the light you were once shining bright.
