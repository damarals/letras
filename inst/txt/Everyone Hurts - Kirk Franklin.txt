"1" "Everyone Hurts
Kirk Franklin

Everyone hurts, and goes through pain
Whatevers first, it feels the same
Be young or poor, old age or fame
Know this for sure, everyone hurts, we all feel pain

Everyone hurts, everyone falls
We let love in, still heartbreak calls
Tell me how much can my soul take
We make mistakes, we hurt we need amazing grace

So we pray tonight, that you dont get weak
and please pray that I, dont forget what I believe
Cause these days are hard, and faith sometimes is work
Pray until He heals the hurt
I trust god will heal the hurt

Everyone hurts, we all ask why
Sinner or saint,everyone tries
Life cuts so deep, feels like your dying
No cross no crown cant give up now please heal tonight

So we pray tonight, that you dont get weak
and please pray that I, dont forget what I believe
Cause these days are hard, and faith sometimes is work
Pray until He heals the hurt
I trust God will heal the hurt

So tonight we cry out for the world, cry out for the world cause everyone hurts,everyone goes through sorrow
Tonight we cry out for the world, cry out for the world, please heal our hearts tongiht

Everyone hurts but not for long
that weight you bare, will make you strong
your guilty stains can be erased
the final price paid by His life amazing grace

So we pray tonight, that you dont get weak
and please pray that I, dont forget what I believe
Cause these days are hard, and faith sometimes is work
Pray until He heals the hurt
I trust God will heal the hurt

I know He will, He'll heal the hurt
[7x]

So tonight we cry out for the world, cry out for the world cause everyone hurts,everyone goes through sorrow..."
