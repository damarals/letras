"1" "Softly And Tenderly
Youthful Praise

Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See on the portals he's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me
English Chorus:
Come home, come home
Ye who are weary, come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, O sinner come home
Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading?
Pleading for you and for me
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies?
Mercies for you and for me
Repeat Chorus
Oh, pour le merveilleux amour qu'il a promis
Nous a promis, toi et moi
Et bien que nous pechions, Il nous offre son pardon
Pardon pour toi et our moi
French Chorus:
Reviens, reviens
Toi, qui te lasses reviens
Sincerement, tendrement, Jesus appelle
(T')Appelle, oh pecheur, reviens
Repeat English Chorus"
