"1" "This Is Love
Vineyard

Nail-pierced hands, a wounded side
This is love, this is love

The holy heart was sacrificed
This is love, this is love

I bow down to the Holy One
I bow down to the Lamb
I bow down to the Worthy One
I bow down to the Lamb

The Son of God died for us
This is love, this is love

He walked the hill, and bore the cross
This is love, this is love"
