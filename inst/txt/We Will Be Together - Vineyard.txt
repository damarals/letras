"1" "We Will Be Together
Vineyard

Soon a day is coming
When the heavens will open

And we will see
Jesus the Holy Lamb of God coming in victory

Soon a day is coming
When darkness will vanish

And sorrow cease
People from every tribe and tongue, living in harmony

All that divides is gone
We will live as one

We will be together
Together with our Saviour

Every promise fulfilled
Every word spoken come to pass

We will be together
Together with our Saviour

Face to face with our God
For all eternity

We will be together"
