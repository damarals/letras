"1" "Break Forth
Diante do Trono

We are strong in our Lord and in his power
Put on the armor of God and stand our ground
To edged sword in our hands and in our mouth
A higher praise
We lift up the name of Jesus

We cry out, Jesus
Jesus
Come, Lord Jesus

Break forth
Break the heaven's open
Break forth
Casting down the strongholds
Break forth
We are longing for Your presence
Send Your glory
Lion of Judah roar

Staring down down principalities and powers
Autorities of darkness in this hour
To the edged sword in our hands and in our mouth
A higher praise
We lift up the name of Jesus

We cry out Jesus
Jesus
Come, Lord Jesus

Break forth
Break the heaven's open
Break forth
Casting down the strongholds
Break forth
We are longing for Your presence
Send Your glory
Lion of Judah roar"
