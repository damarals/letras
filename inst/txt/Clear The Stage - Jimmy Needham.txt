"1" "Clear The Stage
Jimmy Needham

Clear the stage and set the sound and lights ablaze
If that's the measure you must take
To crush the idols

Jerk the pews & all the decorations, too
Until the congregations few, then have revival
Tell your friends that this is where the party ends
Until you're broken for your sins
You can't be social
Then seek the lord
And wait for what he has in store
And know that great is your reward
So just be hopeful

'cause you can sing all you want to
Yes, you can sing all you want to
You can sing all you want to
And still get it wrong
Worship is more than a song

Take a break from all the plans that you have made
And sit at home alone and wait for god to whisper
Beg him please to open up his mouth and speak
And pray for real upon your knees
Until they blister
Shine the light on every corner of your life
Until the pride and lust and lies are in the open
Then read the word and put to test
The things you've heard
Until your heart and soul are stirred
And rocked and broken

We must not worship something that's not even worth it
Clear the stage, make some space
For the one who deserves it

Anything I put before my god
Is an idol
Anything I want whit all my heart is an idol
Anything I can't stop thinking of
Is an idol
Anything that I give all my love is an idol

'cause I can sing all I want to
Yes, I can sing all I want to
We can sing all we want to
We can sing all we want to
We can sing all we want to
And still get it wrong
Worship is more than a song

Clear the stage and set the sound and lights ablaze
If that's the measure
You must take to crush the idols"
