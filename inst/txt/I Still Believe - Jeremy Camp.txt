"1" "I Still Believe
Jeremy Camp

Scattered words and empty thoughts
Seem to pour from my heart
I've never felt so torn before
Seems I don't know where to start
But it's now that I feel Your grace fall like rain
From every fingertip, washing away my pain

Cause I still believe in Your faithfulness
Cause I still believe in Your true
Cause I still believe in Your holy word
Even when I don't see. I still believe

Though the questions still fog up my mind
With promises I still seem to bear
Even when answers slowly unwind
It's my heart I see You prepare
But its now that I feel Your grace fall like rain
From every finger tip, washing away my pain

Cause I still believe in Your faithfulness
Cause I still believe in Your true
Cause I still believe in Your holy word
Even when I don't see. I still believe

Believe well the only place I can go is into your arms
where I throw to you my feeble prayers
Believe In brokenness I can see
That this was your will for me
To help me to know You are near

Cause I still believe in Your faithfulness
Cause I still believe in Your true
Cause I still believe in Your holy word
Even when I don't see. I still believe"
