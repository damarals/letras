Warren Barfield

Beautiful Love, You have changed my world
It’s so much better now
I don’t know what You see in me
But I’m glad that You found

Something
Worth loving oh

I reach for You
I reach for You
I reach for You
You reach for me, too
You reach for me, too
You reach me

You are more than I can take
So all of You I receive
I cannot go to where You are
So You take me

Beyond these
Dreams I dream

I can’t live without You
I don’t wanna be without You
No I can’t live without You
I am never without You"
