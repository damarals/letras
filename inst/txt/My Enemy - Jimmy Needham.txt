"1" "My Enemy
Jimmy Needham

Arms wide, eyes closed
Is there anywhere I can go to
One thing that I seek
That I might find sheltering in You

When suffering is like an ocean, You lead me to dry land
But right now my heart is broken, it's broken

Even though my enemy's right in front of me
You never leave, You never leave
Like the Spirit hovering over the waters
You are covering me, covering me

Wars rage, every day
My foes moving closer still to me
But I will arise as I lift my eyes to see

I would have feared had I not known
You're on Your throne

You are my shining Light, I'll fear no power or might
You are my Day when night comes calling, comes calling
I'll praise You, Father, Son, and Spirit 3 in 1
You lift me up when I am, I'm falling"
