"1" "Fall On Me
Vineyard

Fall on me, ever so gently
Breathe on, breathe on these dry bones
These dry bones

Shower me in Your love
Washing, washing these fi lthy stains
These filthy stains

And break these chains
And break these chains

Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free

And set me free, set me free
Set me free, Lord, set me free"
