"1" "God Rest My Soul
Kutless

When the day is done and the striving ends
There's a place where every heavy heart
Can find the strength to stand, here I am
You're my only hope, my solid ground
Always faithful and forever god, to you alone I bow
Here I am, here I am

God rest my soul, I lay me down
To lose myself in the grace I've found
Oh to die and rise with christ alone
Take my life, god rest my soul

On a lonely hill you were lifted high
Oh the wonder of your sacrifice it overwhelms my life
Here I am, here I am
You have overcome every enemy
Even death has lost its grip on me
I stand in victory

God rest my soul, I lay me down
To lose myself in the grace I've found
Oh to die and rise with christ alone
Take my life, god rest my soul

I surrender, surrender
I surrender
Jesus, I surrender, surrender
I surrender

God rest my soul, I lay me down
To lose myself in the grace I've found
Oh to die and rise with christ alone
Take my life, god rest my soul

Oh, I lay me down
To lose myself in the grace I've found
Oh to die and rise with christ alone
Take my life, god rest my soul"
