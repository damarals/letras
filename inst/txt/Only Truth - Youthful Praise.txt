Youthful Praise

All You ever said before no matter what it was
It was the truth - ever lovin' truth
Every time You spoke a word the voice of God was
Being heard - I know it was truth
It was the truth it was nothing but the truth
Only truth comes from You
It was the truth it was nothing but the truth
And it's all You can do
All You've ever done before no matter what You've chosen
It was right - You are always right
Every time You willed a way and
Everything You've had to say - I know it was right
It was the truth it was nothing but the truth
Only truth comes from You
It was the truth it was nothing but the truth
And it's all You can do
Chorus:
Only truth, loving truth
Only truth, loving truth
(You know it was your Word
And it was the truth
Every lovin' truth
You are always right, all you do is real
Truth comes from you, and it's only you)
Turning to the pages of the Bible of the ages
It was real - All You do is real
Everything You've written down we all will count
On been sound - we know it was real
It was Your word
It was nothing but Your word
That inspired those men
It was Your word
It was nothing but Your word
That will teach us again
(verse one)
Repeat Chorus"
