"1" "Oh Lord, You're Beautiful
Jesus Culture

Oh Lord, You're beautiful
And Your face is all I seek
And when Your eyes are on this child
Your grace abounds to me
(2x)

Your grace abounds to me

I want to take Your word
And shine it all around
First help me just to live it, Lord
And when I'm doing well
Help me to never seek a crown
For my reward is bringing (giving) glory to You
(2x)"
