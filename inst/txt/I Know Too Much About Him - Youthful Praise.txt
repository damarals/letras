"1" "I Know Too Much About Him
Youthful Praise

You can't tell me that the stars
won't come out at night
No you can't tell me that the sun
will refuse to shine
There's nothing you can say or
do that will destroy my peace of mind
I've tried God for myself
And He's with me everytime
You can't tell me that the doctors
have the final say
No you can't tell me that the
Lord won't make a way
There's nothing you can say or do
that will take away my faith
Ever since I tried the Lord
There's been nothing that can take his place
I know too much about Him
And there's nothing to make me doubt Him
Just as sure as I have life
You can't change my mind
You can't tell me nothing
I know God for myself
You can't tell me that a baby doesn't cry
You can't tell me that June isn't before July
There's nothing you can say or do
That will change my reality
I've tried God for myself
And I know He's always with me
You can't tell me that He won't step in
and rescue me
You can't tell me that He didn't die
to set me free
Don't try convincing me that God's nothing everything I need
He's faithful when thers are not
He's the surest friend I've got
He's proven himself to be faithful unto me
If I'd never gone through any trials
Who knows where I would be"
