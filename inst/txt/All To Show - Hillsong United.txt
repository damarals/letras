ALL TO SHOW

(verse 1)
We are a history making generation
For all that's true
Jesus, the life that I live is Your reflection
It's all for You

(pre-chorus)
And unto Your name
All glory and praise
For who You are

(chorus 1)
It's all to show the world
Who you are to me
All to show the world I'm free
In the life you gave

(verse 2)
I see a world of people need a Saviour
And I know your heart
Take me to the nations, take me further
Let me be Your light

(pre-chorus)
(chorus 1)

(chorus 2)
All to show the world
Who You are to me
All to show the world I'm free
In the life You gave to me
In the life You gave

(bridge)
It's all to show the world
What You've done in me
It's all to show the world
Who You are to me

(tag)
My hope, my strength
My beginning and end
Still closer than my closest friend

(chorus 2)

In the life you gave to me
In the life you gave"
