MercyMe

Where do I begin with what to say
I’ve played this conservation in my head so many times
I’m certainly not claiming to know everything
But what I do will save your life

Chorus
I know, I know
That God is able
I know, I know
That He still reigns
I know, I know
That love has found a way

No matter what it is you’re going through
Even if you think you’re far beyond where hope can see
I know there is a hand that’s reaching out for you
Because He did the same for me

Chorus

Bridge
It wasn’t that long ago when my own world fell apart, it fell apart
And everything here inside of me said to let go, you must let go
I found myself crying out to the One who knows my heart, He knows your heart
And holding tight to the few things that I know

Chorus"
