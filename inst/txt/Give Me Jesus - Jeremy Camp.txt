"1" "Give Me Jesus
Jeremy Camp

In the morning when I rise,(3x)
Give me Jesus(3x)

You can have all this world
Just give me Jesus,

When I am alone,(3x)

Give me Jesus!(3x)

You can have all this world,
Just give me Jesus,
Jesus!
Give me Jesus!

When I come to die,(3x)
Give me Jesus!(3x)


You can have all this word,
Just give me Jesus,
Give me Jesus!(3x)


You can have all this world(3x)

Just give me Jesus

Jesus!"
