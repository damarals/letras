Skillet

My skin is my disguise
I'm more than a man
I smile at my demise
Ask who I am
More than a man
More than a man
More than a man
More than a man

My skin is my disguise
I'm more than a man
I was sent to rule on Earth
Ask who I am
I wreck, I wreck, I wreck
I wreck with every prayer
Ask who I am

CHORUS:
Cause I'm stronger, yeah
Than the devil, yeah, yeah
Cause I'm stronger, yeah
Than the devil, yeah, yeah The fear tries to take me
The flesh tries to pull
Blackness all around me but I'm undefeatable
My God is strong
My God is strong
My God is strong
My God is strong
All creation watches for Him to arrive

CHORUS
