"1" "God and God Alone
Chris Tomlin

One church, one faith one anthem raised
God and god alone
One cross, one grace one name that saves
All praise to you belongs
All praise to you belongs

We lift you higher, higher
God and god alone
Your name be louder
Louder than any other song
You are forever seated on your throne
You are forever god and god alone

Who else can wash our sin away
God and god alone
Who else can raise us from the grave
All praise to you belongs
Jesus all praise to you belongs

And what could separate us
From this amazing love
What could say its greater than our god
Ev'ry knee will bow down

Oh what could separate us
From this amazing love
What could say its greater than our god
Ev'ry knee will bow down
Ev'ry knee will bow down

We lift you higher, higher
God and god alone
Your name be louder
Louder than any other song
You are forever seated on your throne

You are forever god and god alone

Oh ev'ry knee will bow down
Yes, ev'ry knee will bow down
Oh, ev'ry knee will bow down"
