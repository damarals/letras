"1" "I Belong To You
Hillsong United

Verse 1
Here I stand
Forever in Your Mighty Hand
Living with Your promise
Written on my heart

Verse 2
I am Yours
Surrendered wholly to You
You set me in Your family
Calling me Your own

Chorus
Now I, I belong to You
All I need Your Spirit
Your Word, Your Truth
Hear my cry, my deep desire
To know You more
In Your Name
I will lift my hands to the King
This anthem of praise I bring
Heaven knows, I long to love You
With all I am, I belong to You

(Repeat verse 1)

(Repeat verse 2)

(Chorus without I belong to You)

In Your Name
I will lift my hands to the King
This anthem of praise I bring
Heaven knows, I long to love You
With all I am, I belong to You

(Instruments)

Chorus
Now I, I belong to You
All I need Your Spirit
Your Word, Your Truth
Hear my cry, my deep desire
To know You more
In Your Name
I will lift my hands to the King
This anthem of praise I bring
Heaven knows, I long to love You
With all I am

In Your Name
I will lift my hands to the King
This anthem of praise I bring
Heaven knows, I long to love You
With all I am, I belong to You"
