"1" "Sweet Will Of God
Amy Grant

My stubborn will at last has yielded
I would be thine and thine alone
And this prayer my lips are bringing
Lord, let in me thy will be done

Sweet will of God, unfold me closer
Til I am wholely lost in thee
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer
Ti I am wholely lost in thee

I am tired of sin, footsore and weary
The darksome path hath dreary grown
But now a light has risen to cheer me
I find in thee my Star, my sun

Sweet will of God, unfold me closer
Til I am wholely lost in thee
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer
Ti I am wholely lost in thee

Thy precious will, O conquering Savior
Doth now embrace and compass me
The storms have ceased, my peace a river
My soul a prisoned bird set free"
