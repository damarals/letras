"1" "I Want To Stroll Over Heaven With You
MÃºsicas Gospel

If I'd surveyed all the goodness
That comes to me from above
And would I count all the blessings
From out of the store house of Love
I simply ask for a favor
Of Him beyond mortal king
I'm sure He'd grant it again and again

(Chorus)
I want to stroll over Heaven
With you some glad day
When all our troubles and heartaches
Have truly vanished away
There we'll enjoy all the beauty
Where all things are new
I want to stroll over Heaven with you

So many places of beauty
We've longed to see here below
But time and treasures have kept us
From making plans as you know
But come the morning of rapture
Together we'll stand anew
And then I'll stroll over Heaven with you

(Repeat Chorus) 2x"
