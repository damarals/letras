"1" "Everybody Ought To Know
Take 6

Do you believe that there's a place in you heart
That could ever help a stranger who is down on his luch
Would you turn and walk away
Maybe a smile is all that he would want (all he would want, oh!)
Someone is afraid
They're feeling no hope at all
It's the color of their skin
That's got them hitting the wall
They say what's the use in climbing
When the ceiling is just too tall

Channel:
I believe that love is truly - oh, truly divine
And when we give it we are truly - oh, truly alive
It's not hard to be a giver when you take the time
Then no one gets left behind

Chorus:
Love is a smile on your face, on a summer day
It's the beat of you heart every breath you take
It can help the flower to grow and everybody ought to know

Life is so much sweeter when we open our eyes
When we look into the person
Rather than the disguise
At the bottom of the package there might be a wonderful prize

Channel
Chorus

Bridge:
Just imagine the things we could do (If love was in everyone's heart)
It might snow in the desert if everyone did his part

Chorus

Ought to know
What the world need now is love sweet love
It's the only thing there's much to little of
True love - the ultimate motivator
Stoney heart regulator - everybody ought to know
C'mon, it's what every soul needs
Tell me how you gonna feel? No love, No deal
Without love, can't walk - can't talk - can't move
Can't live - can't give - can't smile - for awhile
Got to have love
Betta ask somebody 'bout love. Everybody ought to know"
