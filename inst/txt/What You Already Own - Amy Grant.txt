"1" "What You Already Own
Amy Grant

I give you my heart broken and bruised
But still beating strong and wanting to trust you
I know I'm unfaithful
I know I do wrong
Do you protect what you already own?

I give you my body
Naked and meek
Burning with passion
Human and weak
I try to be faithful
then I go wrong
Can you protect what you already own?
Can you protect what you already own?

Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh

I know I'm unfaithful
I know I do wrong
Do you protect what you already own?

I give you my life
Precious and rare
Knowing wherever I've been, you were there
Sometimes I'm faithful
Sometimes I'm strong
Will you protect what you already own?

Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh

I will be faithful
Help me be strong
'Cause you will protect what you already own
You still protect what you already own
