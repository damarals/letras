"1" "Psalm 86
Vineyard

Bend down oh Lord and hear
My prayer of consecration
I offer all my life
For I am devoted to You
Have mercy on me Lord
And in frailty I surrender
Oh Lord You're good
So full of love
For all who long to know You

And with all my heart
I will praise You oh my Lord, my God
I will give all glory to Your name
Forever and ever
Oh forever"
