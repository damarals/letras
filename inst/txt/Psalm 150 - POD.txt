Haleluyah.
Hal'lu el b'kodsho,
Hal'luhu birkia uzo
Hal'luhu bigvurotav,
Hal'luhu k'rov gud'lo
Hal'luhu b'teika shofar,
Hal'luhu b'nevel v'chinor.
Hal'luhu b'tof umachol.
Hal'luhu b'minim v'ugav
Hal'luhu b'tziltzelei shama,
Hal'luhu b'tziltzelei tru'ah
Kol han'shama t'halel yah.
Haleluyah


English:
Praise God in his heavenly dwelling;
praise him in his mighty heaven!
Praise him for his mighty works;
praise his unequaled greatness!
Praise him with a blast of the trumpet;
praise him with the lyre and harp!
Praise him with the tambourine and dancing;
praise him with stringed instruments and flutes!
Praise him with a clash of cymbals;
praise him with loud clanging cymbals.
Let everything that lives sing praises to the Lord!

Praise the Lord!!"
