"x"
"1" "All To You
Ricardo Sá

I made my way
I chose my dreams
I drew my future
and all that I wanted to be

But then You arrive, and knock at my door
I canÂ’t resist, and I open it to You
YouÂ’ve changed all my life
And everything I was, was in Your hands
My way, my dreams, my future

I gave it all to You (4x)

I walked around my small world
I saw myself without faith
How could I forget those days
When I was like a sad song"
