Casting Crowns

All my days i will sing the song of gladness
Give my praise to the fountain of delights
For in my helplessness, you hear my cry
And waves of mercy poured down on my life

Beautiful Savior, wonderful counselor
Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
You're the way, the truth and the life
Star of the morning, glorious in holiness
You're the risen one, heaven's champion
And you reign, you reign
Over all

I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer
I will sing of the land that never fails
Of sins forgiven of conciounce cleared
Of death defeated and life without end

Beautiful Beautiful Savior
Wonderful counselor, beautiful risen one

I long to be where the praise is never ending
Yearn to the will where the glory never fades
Where countless worshippers sing one song
And the voices of the nations
Sing worthy, worthy, worthy
Worthy beautiful beautiful one
Jesus you are worthy, beautiful, beautiful one
Jesus you're wrothy, beatutiful, beautiful one
You are worthy beautiful risen one"
