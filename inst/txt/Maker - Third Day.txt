Third Day

We built our idols just to see them fall
And our false gods brought us nothing at all
How foolish we have been
Forgive us for our sins

Maker, there is none like you
Savior, no one else will do
Lord, there is no other God
Lord, there is no other God
Maker, there is none like you

And on our own
We have nothing but shame
But by your grace
We all can stand again, yeah
How foolish we have been
Forgive us for our sins

Gather together
All around the world
Join with the angels
Lift up your voice
He is our maker
He is our God and our lord

Our maker, there is none like you"
