Vineyard

Your voice is
The voice that
Commanded the universe to be
Your voice is
The voice that
Is speaking words of love to me

How can it be?

Awesome God
Holy God
I worship you in wonder
Awesome God
Holy God
As you draw near I�m humbled
By your majesty
And the mystery
Of your great love for me

Your arms are
The arms that
Hung shining stars in deepest space
Your arms are
The arms that
Surround me in a warm embrace

Amazing grace

Awesome God
Holy God
I worship you in wonder
Awesome God
Holy God
As you draw near I�m humbled

Awesome God
Holy God
I worship you in wonder
Awesome God
Holy God
As you draw near I�m humbled
By your majesty
And the mystery
Of your great love for me"
