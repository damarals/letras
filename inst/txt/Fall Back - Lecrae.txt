Lecrae

Lies in them songs, lies on the television
No tellin' what lies on the television
Learned sarcasm, sexism, racism
Learned to worship money, cars, learned to hate Christians

All the Christians in the movies so typical
Alcoholic, child molesting, hypocritic, mystical
They say since everybody's doing it, it's normal
But Jesus says be transformed and don't let them conform you

You ain't thin enough, you need a new diet
You need a psychic, everybody does it, you should try it
Spring break, hit the beach, what you supposed to do
Be careful what the media impose on you

You learned how to find peace a TV show
You learned how to ride clean from a video
In 30 seconds a commercial have you mixed up
Call now and we can have your whole life fixed up

Hook:
I know you might've seen it on the TV
You hear on the radio and CD
But you can be deceived pretty easy
Believe me, you might wanna fall back

The enemy is crafty and misleading
That's why I use the Word of God to lead me
And I ain't eatin' everything they feed me
Tryna deceive me, so I gotta fall back

These days if you watch the box you should block your
Mind in these times and them lies that could lock you
They tellin' girls in our world to be hot stuff
And tellin' dudes link with crews on the block tough

Plus I'm feeling like they mock us
They think that God is old school like a box cut
But I'm sure that His flock's tough
And we can judge what is bug

And live pleasing in His sight when the clock's up
I hope we gazing through His lens with eyes
So we can defend what it is when we get they lies
Its on that cash that they fix they mind

Man they always sayin' cheese like its picture time
Tell 'em cool it with the mind games
I'm chasing Christ, I'm renewed in my mind frame

And removed from them tired games
Then say my life it ain't mine man
We must remove the damaged parts like a tire change

Hook
Be a rebel let the Word of God lead you
Satan uses media to tempt you and deceive you
He will lead ya, leach ya, leave ya
So be careful as you navigate through media

Take heed before gravity get the best of you
And you find the concrete bench pressin' you
Use the Word of God to help you filter all that
Before you fall into the trap, you better fall back

(Trip Lee)
You know what I call that? I call that maturity
Learnin' how to fall back so you can live in purity
Learnin' how to walk that and sayin' 'You ain't lurin' me
The media is meetin' us with lies but He's curin' me'

I know them guys tryin' to hype you
But cling to the Lord's Word and flee from them vipers
We spittin' aimin' at your heart like snipers
We'd like for you to desire God like Piper"
