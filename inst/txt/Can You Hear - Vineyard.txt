"1" "Can You Hear
Vineyard

Can you hear the sound of the angels
The choir lifting high
One great song of celebration they sing

Can you hear the sound of the people
Victory's in the air
The chains are loose
The captives they are free

The victory is the Lord's
Death you have no sting
Jesus You are Lord over all
We will worship you our King

Can you hear the sound of the children
They're laughing in the streets
Hand in hand
They will dance and sing

I can hear the sound of the children
They're dancing in the streets again"
