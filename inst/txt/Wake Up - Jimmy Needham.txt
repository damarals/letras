"1" "Wake Up
Jimmy Needham

(2 Timothy 2:24-26, Luke 9:23-24)

Wake up from your reality
Make up your mind
Take up your cross and follow me
Child don't be draggin' be laggin' behind

You've wasted all your energy
You've wasted your life
Try to save it you'll lose it
But not if you choose Him
So that you might live

I am who I say that I am
You are who I called to be free
He is the Lion and Lamb
So wake up wake up and get free now

It's paid for the debt is off your hands
Purchased by blood
Grateful, it's your only command
And I'll commend you for a job well done

The eyes of the Lord search to and fro
For one who will serve him
By His Spirit letting him know how much He adores him

So open your eyes He's calling you by name
Remove the lies they're holding you in chains
There's hope in the Holy God
By the Lamb that was slain
So open your eyes
Open your eyes"
