"1" "I'll Be Alright
Warren Barfield

There’s a time in everyone’s life when everything falls
I believe there’s a time in everyone’s life when they can’t find
Any hope at all
I’ve been there

But You have a way of changing everything with just one touch
And I’ll never understand how an unseen hand can do so much
Oh but it does
Yeah it does

And Your presence, it surrounds me
It’s giving me life
And Your blessings fall down on me
They’re pouring over the sides
I know I’ll be alright

If tomorrow brings a little sorrow, that’s ok
‘Cause in the middle of the trial I believe that You will make a way
You always make a way for me
You always make a way

I open up the Holy Book and I take a look inside
All the pages remind me of how You gave Your life
So we could be together
You and me forever"
