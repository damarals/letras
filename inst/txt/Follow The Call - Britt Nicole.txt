Britt Nicole

I've been thinking about the things you've done for me
(Your tears, your blood was shed for me)
How you sent your son to die, you set me free
(You set me free, yeah)

I'm gonna follow the call
Tell me where and I'll go
I'll only look to the one
Who sent his only son
I'm gonna follow the call

Wherever you want me to go that's where I'll be
(Your tears, your blood was shed for me)
Although the cost is high, lord, here I am, send me
(You set me free, yeah)
I can't imagine how the world could live a life without your son
So I make my pledge to tell the world of your sweet, sweet love

I'm gonna follow the call
Tell me where and I'll go
I'll only look to the one
Who sent his only son
I'm gonna follow the call

I'll remain in your love until you call me away
'Cause I know sweet Jesus, you're the truth, the light, the way
I can't imagine how the world could live a life without your son
So I make my pledge to tell the world of your sweet, sweet love"
