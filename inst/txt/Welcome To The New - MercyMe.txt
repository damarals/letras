"1" "Welcome To The New
MercyMe

Got to live right just stay in line
You've heard it all at least a million times
And like me you believed it
They said it wasn't works
But trying harder wouldn't hurt
It sounds so crazy now
But back then you couldn't see it

But now here you are
Eyes open wide
It's like you're seeing grace
In a brand new light
For the first time

Let us be the first to welcome you
Welcome to the
Life you thought was too good to be true
Welcome to the new

You broke your back kept all the rules
Jumped through the hoops
To make God approve of you
Oh tell me was it worth it
The whole time you were spinning plates
Did you stop to think that
Maybe He is ok with just you
There's no need to join the circus

But now here you are
A new point of view
And now it all makes sense
Why He's called it Good News

Let us be the first to welcome you
Welcome to the
Life you thought was too good to be true
Welcome to the new

Look at you
Shiny and new
Look at you
You got the proof of purchase
You were purchased
''Cause you're worth it
Look at you
Finding your groove
Don't you dare think
That you're not worth it
'Cause you're worth it
Yeah you're worth it

Let us be the first to welcome you
Welcome to the
Life you thought was too good to be true
Welcome to the new"
