"1" "Won't Be Afraid
Newsboys

Fear, you won't take me down
Hate, you won't steal my crown

You're a king with no kingdom
A prince with no peace
You've had your day
But today, that's not me, 'cause

When I walk through the fires of life, I
Won't be afraid, no, won't be afraid, no
God, You walk through the fires with me, so
Won't be afraid, no, won't be afraid
I lift my eyes up, I cast my cares up
With faith like a child, oh, no matter what, no matter what (Hey)
When I walk through the fires of life, I
Won't be afraid, no, won't be afraid, no

So keep walk, walk, walk, walk, walkin'
So keep walk, walk, walk, walk, walkin'

So now, we soldier on
Let love be the first and the last word on our tongue

Oh, fight the good fight
Push back the darkness
Light up the night
Light it up, light it up, hey

When I walk through the fires of life, I
Won't be afraid, no, won't be afraid, no
God, You walk through the fires with me, so
Won't be afraid, no, won't be afraid
I lift my eyes up, I cast my cares up
With faith like a child, oh, no matter what, no matter what (Hey)
When I walk through the fires of life, I
Won't be afraid, no, won't be afraid, no

I can feel my soul gettin' freed now
Layin' all my burdens down, I'm free now
Singin', \"Hallelujah, I'm redeemed now\"
I can feel my soul gettin' freed now
Layin' all my burdens down, I'm free now
Singin', \"Allelujah, I'm redeemed now\"
Hallelujah, allelujah

When I walk through the fires of life, I
Won't be afraid, no, won't be afraid, no
God, You walk through the fires with me, so
Won't be afraid, no, won't be afraid
I lift my eyes up, I cast my cares up
With faith like a child, oh, no matter what, no matter what (Hey)
When I walk through the fires of life, I
Won't be afraid, no, won't be afraid, no

So keep walk, walk, walk, walk, walkin' (No, I won't be afraid)
So keep walk, walk, walk, walk, walkin' ('Cause You already made a way)
So keep walk, walk, walk, walk, walkin' (I won't be afraid)
So keep walk, walk, walk, walk, walkin' ('Cause You've already made a way)

You made a way, You made a way
So I won't be afraid"
