"1" "Take It All
Hillsong United

Searching the world
The lost will be found
In freedom we live
As one we cry out
You carried the cross
You died and rose again
My god, I'll only ever give my all

You sent your son
From heaven to earth
You delivered us all
It's eternally heard
I searched for truth
And all I found was you
My god, I'll only ever give my all

Jesus we're living for your name
We'll never be ashamed of you
Our praise and all we are today
Take, take, take it all
Take, take take, it all

Running to the one who heals the blind
following the shinning light
In your hands the power to save the world, my life"
