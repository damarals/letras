Let Him In

God so loved the world
He gave His only Son
And whosoever believes in Him
Becomes a chosen one

He came that we may live
And live abundantly
For all of us have many sins
And fall short of His glory

If you believe in Him
A new life begins
You will be born again
Believe He died for you
And rose again in truth
Now there's only
One thing left to do

(Chorus)
Let - Him - In
Inside of you

You are a new creation
When you see the light
You'll understand the separation
Like morning from the night

Suddenly there's meaning
To every single word
That's written in the scriptures
It's clear and never blurred

If you believe in Him
A new life begins
You will be born again
Believe He died for you
And rose again in truth
Now there's only
One thing left for you to do

(Chorus)
Let - Him - In
Side of you
Let - Him - In
Inside of you"
