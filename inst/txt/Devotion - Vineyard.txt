You are boundless mercy, You are endless grace
You are sweet forgiveness, ceaseless faithfulness

Washing over me….
You are sovereign Father, you are healing King

You are tender Saviour, righteous offering
Poured out for me

And I surrender to You
Lord I’m yielding all I am to You

You have captivated me
And I come to give my devotion

You are boundless mercy, You are endless grace
You are sweet forgiveness, ceaseless faithfulness

Washing over me"
