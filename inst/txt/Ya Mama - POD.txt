P.O.D.

What you know about that fallen, fallen
Babylon this so called great dead
wait, Dread bout to update the death rate in one take
Make no mistake we the real deala
The radical natural born wig-splitter
Gonna getcha, with the styles
that make ya so hot and more drama
Though when droppin the sure-shot
I rock it steady, be ready
until the track is diminished
and when the die goes belly up
consider it finished

Sounds like it's Jah to me,
Sounds like it's Jah to me,
The sum of everything, yeah
Close your eyes so you can see
Peace, Love, and Harmony
Sounds like it's Jah to me, yeah

We keep on movin like don't stop, let it go
soul to soul, returnin the controls
tag em up and label em John Doe
The raw flow, We built the new style empire
blazin my quire, like that 4th man on fire
This guns for hire, take devour the Nazarenes
Then come clean, They're crazy baldheads dontcha mean
Wickedness fill the sky on the death blow
draw the name across your chest
incase the dog catcher wants to know

Sounds like it's Jah to me,
Sounds like it's Jah to me,
The sum of everything, yeah
Close your eyes so you can see
Peace, Love, and Harmony
Sounds like it's Jah to me, yeah

It's gotta be Jah
It's gotta be Jah, Jah, Jah
Jah, Jah, Jah

Jah! Jah! Jah! Jah!
Sounds like it's Jah to me,
Sounds like it's Jah to me,
The sum of everything, yeah
Close your eyes so you can see
Peace, Love, and Harmony
Sounds like it's Jah to me, yeah

What could it be, Jah
What could it be, Jah
What could be"
