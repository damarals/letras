"1" "Amazing Love
Chris Tomlin

I’m forgiven ‘cause You forsaken,
I’m accepted, You were condemned.
I am alive and well, Your sprit is within me,
Cause You died and rose again.
(Repeat x2)

(Chorus)
Amazing love,
How can it be?
That You, my King would die for me?
Amazing love,
I know it’s true.
It’s my joy to honour You,
In all I do, I honour You.

I’m forgiven ‘cause You forsaken,
I’m accepted, You were condemned.
I am alive and well, Your sprit is within me,
Cause You died and rose again.

(Repeat chorus x2)

You are my King
(Repeat x4)

(Repeat chorus x2)

You are my King
(Repeat x8)"
