"1" "A Place Called Earth
Lauren Daigle

Oh, how I long for heaven in a place called earth
Where every son and daughter will know their worth
Where all of the streets resound with thunderous joy
Oh, how I long for heaven in a place called earth

Oh, the wars we haven't won
Oh, the songs we've left unsung
Oh, the dreams we haven't seen
The borderlines

And here we are between all of our hopes and fears
Chasing down these stolen years
Reaching out for hands unseen
Oh the borderlines, the borderlines

Oh, how I long for heaven in a place called earth
Where every son and daughter will know their worth
Where all of the streets resound with thunderous joy
Oh, how I long for heaven in a place called earth

Jesus name still on her tongue
Questions buried in her lungs
Oh my father, why my son?
The borderlines, the borderlines

Oh, how I long for heaven in a place called earth where every son and daughter will know their worth
Where all of the streets resound with thunderous joy
Oh, how I long for heaven in a place called earth

I had a dream that I finally saw your face
Dancing in the arms of grace
Dancing through the joy and pain
Oh the borderlines, the borderlines

Oh, how I long for heaven in a place called earth
Where every son and daughter will know their worth
Where all of the streets resound with thunderous joy
Oh, how I long for heaven in a place called earth
Oh, how I long for heaven in a place called earth"
