Dominic Balli

Where you go I’ll follow even ‘til death and sorrow
I’m begging you please don’t go
That’s what she said to him on the day that he left them
Left all alone nowhere to go
Gazing over the bay where her only brother lay
It’d been far too long without him
Do I sleep to join him or can I live without him
There’s got to be a shelter from this storm

The Refuge of Zion comes
The Refuge of Zion comes for me

Seventy-nine years when my Great Grandma stopped breathing
He sat by her bedside waiting
It’d been a year since she knew what was reality
When she came to and said like chains come free

You are my strength and shelter
You hold me through the storm
Your hands won't fail nor falter
When I’m overwhelmed"
