"1" "I'll Be Home For Christmas
Amy Grant

I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know
It's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe and presents under the tree
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
