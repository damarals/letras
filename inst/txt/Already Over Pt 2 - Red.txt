"1" "Already Over Pt. 2
Red

You never go
You're always here
Beneath my skin
I cannot run away
Fading slowly

Give it all to you
Reaching as I fall
It's already over, already over now

My best defense, running to you
I can't resist, take all you want from me
Breaking slowly

Give it all to you
Reaching as I fall
It's already over now
Loving you again

It's already over, already over now
You're what I reach for when I fall
It's already over
You're what I reach for when I fall
It's already over now"
