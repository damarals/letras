"1" "A Picture Of Grace
Gaither Vocal Band

Picture a man with no reason for living

With no hope of smiling again

Imagine a world with no golden daybreak

Enclosed by the blackness of sin

And the sea is bathed in beauty and glory

Transformed by love's sweet embrace

The hands of the Savior

Erased all my sorrow

And painted this picture of Grace



How skillful the hands of the artist

Who painted this picture of me

He saw with the eye's of a Master

How beautiful my life could be

Where once was a portrait of gloom and despair

This masterpiece hangs in it's place

It's signed with His blood

And it's framed with His glory

This beautiful picture of Grace


The ashes and ruin

That once filled the picture

Had vanished and faded from view

And beautiful touches of mercy adorned

This picture He painted anew

Such peace filled the eyes of the man He created

A smile gently rests on His face,

Since Jesus erased all the guilt of my past

And painted this picture of grace



How skillful the hands of the artist

Who painted this picture of me

He saw with the eye's of a Master

How beautiful my life could be

Where once was a portrait of gloom and despair

This masterpiece hangs in it's place

It's signed with His blood

And it's framed with His glory

This beautiful picture of Grace

Where once was a portrait of gloom and despair

This masterpiece hangs in it's place

It's signed with His blood

And it's framed in His glory

This beautiful picture of Grace

This beautiful picture of Grace"
