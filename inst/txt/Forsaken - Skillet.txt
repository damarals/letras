Why do I have to beg
When all this left
Is a memory
Forsaken
Why do I have to beg
When all this left
Is a memory
Forsaken, forsaken, forsaken

Forsaken, forsaken, forsaken

I recall going madly in love with you
Aand I remember this
How could I forget
Regret is a needle in
My neck it's slowly filling me with poison
Spreading to my chest

Take my pain
And numb me from this

Why do I have to beg
When all this left
Is a memory
Forsaken
Why do I have to beg
When all this left
Is a memory
Forsaken

I recall pledging my sole devotion to you
It reminds me how now i'm on my knees
My guilt consumes, lost the will in me
Wasting away before you
Hold me closer please

Take my pain
And numb me from this

Why do I have to beg
When all this left
Is a memory
Forsaken
Why do I have to beg
When all this left
Is a memory
Forsaken

Yeeeah, yeeeah, yeeeah

Forsake
You break me
Forsake
You break me
You're breaking me

I recall going madly in love with you
and I remember this...

Tell me why do I have to beg
When all this left
Is a memory
Forsaken
Why do I have to beg
When all this left
Is a memory
Forsaken

Tell my why, why!
Why. why!"
