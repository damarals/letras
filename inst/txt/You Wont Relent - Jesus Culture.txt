"1" "You Won't Relent
Jesus Culture

You won't relent until You have it all
My heart is Yours

I'll set you as a seal, upon my heart
As a seal upon my arm
For there is love, that is as strong as death
Jealousy demanding as the grave

And many waters, cannot quench this love

Chorus:
Come be the fire inside of me
Come be the flame upon my heart
Come be the fire inside of me
Until you and I are one

I don't wanna talk about you like you're
Not in the room
I wanna look right at you,
Wanna sing right to you"
