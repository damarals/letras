"1" "Time Has Come
MercyMe

There is a season for everything
There is a reason for all things here on earth
Every second of every moment seems to have its worth

Rest assured life's not in vain
For all things work here for His fame

Chorus
Time has come
To raise our hearts as one
And glorify the God of everything
We live our lives
For the renown of Christ
Oh we are children of the sovereign King

From the moment of our first breath
To the second we bid this world goodbye
And everything that is in between was made to magnify

The One who holds all things in place
The Ruler over time and space

Chorus"
