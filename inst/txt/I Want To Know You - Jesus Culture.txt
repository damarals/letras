"1" "I Want To Know You
Jesus Culture

I stand before You, Awed by Your Majesty
Covered by Your mercy, Your blood has made me free
Draw me to You, and set my heart on fire

I want to Know You,
You're my one desire

I give you my worship
All of my Passion
I give you my whole heart
All my devotion

Grace never ending, Your hands they carry me
Your body is broken for all the world to see
My heart is held by your love so unconditional

You captivate me
You're the lover of my soul

I give you my worship
All of my Passion
I give you my whole heart
All my devotion

Here I will bow down
Say that I need You
Here I will worship
Say that I love you

Oh how I love you (4x)

I want to know You
Let Your Spirit overwhelm me
Let Your Presence overtake my heart"
