Brian Littrell - I Surrender All

All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust him
In His presence daily live

Chorus:
I surrender all, I surrender all
All to Thee my blessed Savior
I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender
Humbly at His feet I bow
Worldly pleasures all forsaken
Take me, Jesus, Take me now

Chorus:
I surrender all, I surrender all
All to Thee my blessed Savior
I surrender all

Lord I give to You
All I ever have
And everything I was
And everything I am
And now I laid it down
I lay it at Your feet
To Your grace
To Your power
I surrender all

Lord, I give myself to Thee
Fill me with thy love and power
Let thy blessing fall on me

Chorus:
I surrender all, I surrender all
All to Thee my blessed Savior
I surrender all"
