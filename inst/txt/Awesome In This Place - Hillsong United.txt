"1" "Awesome In This Place
Hillsong United

Here in this house of the great King
We've come together now to worship Him.
This house is built on Christ, our rock
Cannot be shaken, cannot be shaken.

God is awesome in this place
We sense His presence as we sing His praise.
There is power here for miracles
To set the captives free
And make the broken whole
God is awesome
He's so awesome
God is awesome in this place.

I've found where I belong
I'm a living stone
In this house I will grow."
