"1" "My World Needs You
Kirk Franklin

Show me your face
Fill up this space
My world needs you right now
My world needs you right now
I can't escape
Being afraid
Fill me with you right now
My world needs you right now

Show me your face
Fill up this space
My world needs you right now
My world needs you right now
I can't escape
Being afraid
Fill me with you right now
My world needs you right now

Power fall down
Bring with it a sound
That points us to you right now
Erase substitutes right now
Fix what I see
And God please fix me
My world needs you right now
Let us see you right now

Power fall down
Bring with it a sound
That points us to you right now
Erase substitutes right now
Fix what I see
And God please fix me
My world needs you right now
Let us see you right now

Every heart in the world
God, needs you to rescue
Storms have come and torn our hearts in two
We need you

Show me your face
Fill up this space
My world needs you right now
My world needs you right now

Storms may come
but when we call your name
All things change
Kingdoms fall, one thing
Forever reigns is your name
The anchor that holds me in my pain stays the same
Oh how sweet to know that your great name
Will never change

Jesus, (oh)
Jesus, (nobody like you Jesus)
Jesus, (power is in the name Jesus)
Jesus, (yes I need you)
Jesus, (that's where the power is)
Jesus, (you have all of the authority)
Jesus, (only you are the great I am
you're the king of kings, you're the lord of lords)
Jesus

Storms may come
But when we call your name
All things change
Kingdoms fall, one thing
Forever reigns is your name
Oh how sweet to know that your great name
Will never change
It's stays the same

Show me your face
Come fill this space
My world needs you right now
My world needs you right now"
