Kutless

Open up my eyes to see
All of you, your mysteries
I hold my breath, You hold my hand
As heaven melts the heart of man

How amazed I am

Your glory fills the sky, a great and holy light
Shining like a million stars, I'm amazed by who you are
Lord we lift you high, Oh God be magnified
You have overwhelmed my heart, I'm amazed by who you are

The universe is at your feet and angels bow when you speak
So high above our greatest song but still you call and we will come

How amazed I am

Your glory fills the sky, a great and holy light
Shining like a million stars, I'm amazed by who you are
Lord we lift you high, Oh God be magnified
You have overwhelmed my heart, I'm amazed by who you are
