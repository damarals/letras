"1" "So Good
Vineyard

You are so good to me
You are You are so so good
You are so good to me
You are You are so so good

I'm gonna shout it from the mountaintop
You know I just can't keep it to myself
In light of all You've done
And all You keep doing
I've got to tell the world

(BRIDGE)
I need to sing it out
I need to let it out
I need to tell You now
I need to let You know

(ENDING)
You are so so good to me
You are so so good to me"
