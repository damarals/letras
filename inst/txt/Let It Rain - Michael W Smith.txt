Michael W. Smith

//Let it rain, Let it rain
Open the floodgates of Heaven//

Psalm 97: 1-6 (Niv): The Lord reigns, let the earth be glad; let the distant
shores rejoice. Clouds and thick darkness surround Him; righteousness and
justice are the foundation of His throne. Fire goes before Him and consumes His
foes on every side. His lightning lights up the world; the earth sees and
trembles. The mountains melt like wax before the Lord of all the earth. The
heavens proclaim His righteousness and all the peoples will see His glory."
