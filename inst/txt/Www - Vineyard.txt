Everybody come now
Everything that lives
In this wide wide world
Everybody dance now
Before the living God
Of this wide wide world

Everybody praise now
Eveybody shout
In this wide wide world
Everybody sing now
Sing a brand new song
In this wide wide world

Sing to the Lord everybody
Everything that breathes
Everything that moves
Dance to the Lord everybody
Everything that breathes
Everything that moves
Ascribe to the Lord glory and honour
Ascribe to the Lord everything
For He rules with justice
And He reigns supreme
Heavens be glad
Earth rejoice
For the Lord is coming
To judge this wide wide world

(BRIDGE)
Everybody praise the Lord
Everybody praise the Lord
Everybody praise the Lord
Everybody praise the Lord"
