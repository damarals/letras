Delirious

Hey!
CHORUS
Oh I could sing unending songs
Of how You saved my soul
Well I could dance a thousand miles
Because of Your great love

Verse 1
Yeah!
My heart is bursting Lord
To tell of all You've done
Of how You've changed my life, and wiped away the past
Oh I wanna shout it out
From every roof top sing
For now I know that God is for me not against me

CHORUS
Oh everybody dance!
Verse 1
CHORUS
Oh everybody dance!

Everybody's singin' now....cause we're so happy!
Everybody's dancin' now....cause we're so happy!
If only we could see Your face
And see You smilin' over us
As unseen Angels celebrate, cause joy's in this place!

CHORUS
