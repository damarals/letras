"1" "The Masks Slips Away
Red

[Verse 1]
I feel a change in the air
The horizon stirs
Above, the lightning flares
And the wheel starts to turn

[Chorus]
I'm tired of running
I'm tired of hiding
Feeling the mask slip away
I tried to hold you
I tried to keep you

[Verse 2]
The sting of cold winter rain
Somehow I need it to hurt
You set the ocean aflame
I'll stand and watch it burn

[Chorus]
I'm tired of running
I'm tired of hiding
Feeling the mask slip away
I tried to hold you
I tried to keep you
Feeling the mask slip away

[Chorus]
I'm tired of running
I'm tired of hiding
Feeling the mask slip away
I tried to hold you
I tried to keep you
Feeling the mask slip away
I'm tired of running
I'm tired of hiding
Feeling the mask slip away
I tried to hold you
I tried to keep you, love you, save you
But you're gone
I tried to save you
But you're gone"
