Hillsong United

Deck the halls, ring the bells
Christmas time is here
Mistletoe don't you know?
Christmas time is here again
Stockings are hung up high
By the fireside
Oh Christmas
Happy Christmas to all

Can you hear the children say:
\"Jesus Christ was born this day\"?

Let the world hold to the hope
Given to us so long ago
Let every boy, let every girl
Sing glory to Emmanuel

Oh sing of the hope and remember well
(Remember well)
How upon Christmas day
Jesus came as the Son of Man
King of Redemption for all the world"
