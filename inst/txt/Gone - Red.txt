"1" "Gone
Red

Disappear, without a trace
A treasure lost, I can't replace
The only piece that still remains
Is in these scars, is in this pain

I want to save it all
I want to take it all
My heart is holding on
I bleed, I bleed for love

When I'm gone
When I fade away
Is the air I breathe my only legacy?
When I'm gone

In the dark, I am a flame
A passing light, all in vain
I feel the pull, I feel a change
It's over now, it slips away

I want to save it all
I want to take it all
My heart is holding on
I bleed, I bleed for love

When I'm gone
When I fade away
Is the air I breathe my only legacy?
When I'm gone
When I'm gone
When I'm gone

I want to save it all
I want to take it all
My heart is holding on
I bleed, I bleed for love

When I'm gone
When I fade away
Is the air I breathe my only legacy?
When I'm gone
When I'm gone
When I'm gone"
