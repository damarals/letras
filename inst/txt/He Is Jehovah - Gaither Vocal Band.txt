Gaither Vocal Band

He is Jehovah, God of creation
He is Jehovah, lord God almighty
The balm of gilead, the rock of ages
He is Jehovah, the God that healeth thee

Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah
He is Jehovah, lord God almighty
He is Jehovah, the God that healeth thee

He is the great I am, the God of abraham
Jehovah shalom, the God peace I am
The God of israel, the everlasting one
He is Jehovah, the God that healeth thee

He's your provider, Jehovah jireh
God of salvation, God of messiah
The son he sent to you, and testified of him
He is Jehovah, the God that healeth thee"
