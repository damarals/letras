"1" "Amazing Life (Capital Kings Remix)
Britt Nicole

Amazing life
Amazing life
Flying higher than I've ever dreamed
From the top of the world I could scream
Amazing life
Amazing life

It's a colorful-colorful world painted so bright
Gonna walk on air, gonna take a flight
I'll never understand it all
It must be supernatural

I wanna drink-drink-drink every drop of sunshine
Got a smile on my smile, I won't apologize
I'll never understand it all
It must be supernatural

You're the burning in my heart that never dies, never dies
Without You here my world is black and white, black and white
Like a show without a stage
Like a storm without the rain
You're the one I can't replace
Need You by my side
Need You by my side"
