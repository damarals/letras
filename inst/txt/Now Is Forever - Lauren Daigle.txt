"1" "Now Is Forever
Lauren Daigle

I need to see you turn this water into wine
I need to see your kingdom come with my own eyes
Take anything you want, I'll hand it over
Now what to hold, and what to leave behind

I wanna let forever end
Show me the moment where I end and you begin
I wanna be where heaven is
Oh, stay with me until now is forever

Take the treasure and the trial, I cast them off
'til I am holding onto nothing, but the cross
Depending on the love that won me over
Surrendering the right to keep control

Awake, awake my soul
Awake to know as I am known
I wanna let forever end

I wanna let forever end
Show me the moment where I end and you begin
I wanna be where heaven is
Oh, stay with me, oh, stay with me

I wanna let forever end
Show me the moment where I end and you begin
I wanna be where heaven is
Oh, stay with me until now is forever"
