Third Day

Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day

From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #5.

I tasted fruit that was forbidden
I murdered trust that you had given
And now I'm living in a place that's not my home

The pain in your heart made you regret
The moment we spoke, did you forget?
Will my transgressions bring us all to our sweet end?

Maybe I'm just being too hard on myself. I don't know
Or is it that your mercy is much more than I deserve?

Betrayed by more than just a kiss
I did much more I must admit
"
