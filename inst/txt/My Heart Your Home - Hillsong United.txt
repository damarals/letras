"1" "My Heart, Your Home
Hillsong United

Come and make my heart your home,
Come and be everything I am and Lord I know,
Search me through and through,
Till my heart becomes a home for you

A home for you.... oh...
A home for you... oh...
Let everything I do...
Open up a door for you to come through,
And then my heart will be
A place where you wanna be"
