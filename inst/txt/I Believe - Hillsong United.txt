"1" "I Believe
Hillsong United

Now I know there’s a better way
I love You more and more each day
I put my faith in the One I love
I believe in God above


I believe, I believe
I believe in the Son of God
I’m alive in You Jesus
No one could ever
Save my soul but You


Forever, forever
Forever I’ll praise Your name"
