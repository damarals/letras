Hillsong United

Be the crown in the light and sound
Be the fire burning inside out
Be the love casting out all fear
Let your name move the atmosphere
Oh ho ho ho ho, oh oh oh

Love like the skies are wide
Crashing down to bring the world to life
Hope came dancing on an empty grave
Death has lost it's rule to the King of grace

Be the crown in the light and sound
Be the fire burning inside out
Be the love casting out all fear
Let your name move the atmosphere
Oh ho ho ho ho, oh oh oh

And we owe it all to Jesus
Sin and all the shame deleted
Death and all the chains defeated
And the light we see it's Jesus
And the air we breathe is freedom
And the sound it knows no fear
Your love rules the atmosphere
Oh ho ho ho ho, oh oh oh

Your love rules the atmosphere
Oh ho ho ho ho, oh oh oh

Be the crown in the light and sound
Be the fire burning inside out
Be the love casting out all fear
Let your name move the atmosphere"
