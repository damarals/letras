"1" "People Just Like Us
Hillsong United

Every nation power and tongue
will bow down to your name
Every eye will see
Every ear will hear your name proclaimed

And this is gonna be our cry
until you come again
Jesus is the only name
By which man can be saved

CHORUS
All over the world people just like us
Are calling your name
Living in your love
All over the world people just like us
Are following Jesus
x2

(repeat from top)

We're worshipping Jesus
We're following Jesus
We're worshipping Jesus
We're calling on Jesus

Makes you wanna dance (echo)
Makes you wanna sing (echo)
Makes you wanna shout all about it
shout all about it,
shout it that Jesus is king
(repeat)

CHORUS"
