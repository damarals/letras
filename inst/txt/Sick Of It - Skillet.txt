Skillet

If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it

If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it!

When everything you do
Don't thing a matter
Your trouble is not usual
World is getting blacker

When every time you fail
Has no answer
Every empty promise made
His own reminder

No one can make this better
Take control it's now or never!

Are you sick of it?
Raise your hands - get rid of it!
While there's a fighting chance
Are you over it?
Bored to death?
Have you had enough regret?
Take a stand, raise your hands
If you're sick of it!

If you're sick of
If you're sick of
If you're sick of it!
Sick of it!
If you' re sick of it!

Every single day
I chase my own tale
Like a bad inside of me
Gotta gotta gotta get away

I'm running out of time
For me to break this
I'm done to feeling like
I never gonna make this

No one can make this better
Take control it's now or never!

Are you sick of it?
Raise your hands - get rid of it!
While there's a fighting chance
Are you over it?
Bored to death?
Have you had enough regret?
Take a stand, raise your hands
If you're sick of it!

If you're sick of
If you're sick of
If you're sick of it!
Sick of it!
If you' re sick of it!

I'm tired of it
I'm over it
I'm bored to death

Gonna face this
I'M SICK OF IT!

Raise your hands
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it

Raise your hands
If you're sick
If you're sick of it

Sick of it!
Raise your hands - get rid of it!
While there's a fighting chance
Are you over it?
Bored to death?
Have you had enough regret?
Take a stand, raise your hands
If you're sick of it!

Are you sick of it?
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it

Get rid of it!
If you're sick
If you're sick of it

Are you over it?
Bored to death?
Have you had enough regret?
Take a stand, raise your hands

Are you sick of it?
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it

Are you sick of it?
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it

Are you sick of it?
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it

If you're sick of it
If you're sick
If you're sick
If you're sick of it"
