"1" "One Thing
Vineyard

I've had a vision
That we are living
In strange times
Everything's shaking
The whole Earth is quaking
And heaven's on my mind
But I'm still believing
Though all I know just fades away
That out in the darkness
A light is shining
And love will never fade

All that I see (dream)
All that I am (need)
I find in You
All of my world
All of my life
I find in just one thing

Oh I've been dreaming
That we'll be living
Where freedom reigns
The sounds of war ended
Where peace, love and justice
Will bring in each new day
And I'm still believing
And I'm receiving the strength I find
There's joy in the morning
A new day is dawning
Where love will always shine"
