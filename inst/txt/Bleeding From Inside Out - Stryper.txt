"1" "Bleeding From Inside Out
Stryper

You've lived a hard life a self made prisoner
You've built your house upon the sand
It sharpens the dull knife
That cuts and makes you endure
The scars that label you a broken man

[Chorus:]
You're Bleeding from inside out
Wounded beyond your own recognition
You're bandaged in fear and doubt
Brought to your knees by a life and death collision

You see what you want to see
A child in make believe
You rule the land where you are king
There's rain that washes clean
The soul that stains your legacy
There is redemption - it's your destiny!

[Chorus]"
