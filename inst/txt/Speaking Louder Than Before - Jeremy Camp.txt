"1" "Speaking Louder Than Before
Jeremy Camp

Hear now this declaration
From out across the nations
We need to wake up and understand

Many hurting hearts are crying
But our voices seem to be dying
Can you see the battle raging on?

We are the light to reach this world
We are the salt preserving these souls
Let's show them the love that we've received now

We are, we are in desperation
We need to reach this generation
We are speaking louder than before

We are the hope that's been forgotten
We have a love that will be brought and
We are speaking louder than before

Take every chance that you can
Move together taking a stand
Never losing heart, we'll speak as one

We need to be the image of Christ
Show love and serve at all times
We can make a difference in these lands

We are the light to reach this world
We are the salt preserving these souls
Let's show them the love that we've received now

We are, we are in desperation
We need to reach this generation
We are speaking louder than before

We are the hope that's been forgotten
We have the love that will be brought and
We are speaking louder than before

Everything's so surreal
But this urgency I feel
We should be reaching out to all these desperate
pleas

Oh, the need is real can't you feel
This call to revolution
My beating heart is breaking for them
That's why I'm speaking now
That's why I'm speaking now

We are, we are in desperation
We need to reach this generation
We are speaking louder than before

We are the hope that's been forgotten
We have a love that will be brought and
We are speaking louder than before

We are, we are, we're speaking louder
We are, we are, we're speaking louder
We are speaking louder than before
We are speaking louder than before
Oh, yeah"
