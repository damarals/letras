Lauren Daigle

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh, its

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

Oh, what fun it is to ride
Oh, what fun it is to ride
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh"
