"1" "Be The Moon
Chris Tomlin

You're the Lord of all creation, God, You made me in Your image
And I'm just a reflection of the love that I've been given
Everybody wants to be somebody
I wanna be somebody too
If I'm gonna be known for something
I wanna be known for You

I wanna be the moon, up among the stars
Fly around the world, lighting up the dark at night
I'm nothing without the Son's amazing grace
On everything I do
If You're shining on me, I'm shining right back for You
I wanna be the moon
Lord, I wanna be the moon for You

Yeah, there's gonna be some cloudy days
Sometimes it's gonna cover up the work You're doing in me
But still with every breath I breathe

I wanna be the moon (I wanna be the moon)
Up among the stars (Up among the stars)
Fly around the world (Fly around the world)
Lighting up the dark at night (Lighting up the night)
I'm nothing without the Son's amazing grace
On everything I do
If You're shining on me
I'm shining right back for You
I wanna be the moon
(Lord, I wanna be the moon for You)

Everybody wants to be somebody
I wanna be somebody too
If I'm gonna be known for something
I wanna be known for You

I wanna be the moon
Up among the stars
Fly around the world
Lighting up the darkest nights

I wanna be the moon (I wanna be the moon)
Up among the stars (Up among the stars)
Fly around the world (Fly around the world)
Lighting up the dark at night (Lighting up the night)
I'm nothing without the Son's amazing grace
On everything I do
If You're shining on me
I'm shining right back for You
I wanna be the moon, hmm, hmm
(Lord, I wanna be the moon for You)
Lord, I wanna be the moon for You"
