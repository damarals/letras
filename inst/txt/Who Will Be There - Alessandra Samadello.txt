"1" "Who Will Be There?
Alessandra Samadello

Who will be there to hear my call?
Who will be there when I am on a verge of a fall?
Who will be there with open arms to take my all?
Who will be there inside the pain?
Who will be there with a heart that can feel the same?
Just as my heart and take my hand and let me stand?

Who will be there to quiet down my every fear?
Who will be there to take away all of my tears?
Who will be there to light my way to bring me home and let me stay?
Who will be there, you will be there
God will be there."
