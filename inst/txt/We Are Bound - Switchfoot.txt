"x"
"1" "We Are Bound
Switchfoot

A slip of a tongue and fist
A slight of a hand like this
Touch of the fingertips
Goes through the note we skipped

- Chorus -

We are bound
We are falling through you
We are bound
We are falling through

A moment of bitter bliss
Licking your Judas lips
Throwing a timeless fit
With tongues of a fire we lit

- Chorus -

We are bound
We are falling through you
We are bound
We are falling through

We follow sons amiss
The sons of the counterfeits
The devil has called me from inside

We are bound
We are falling through

Counterfeit sons, counterfeit sons, counterfeit sons"
