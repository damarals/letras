"1" "Imagine/Sing the Wondrous Love of Jesus
Amy Grant

I can only imagine what it will be like
When I walk by Your side
I can only imagine what my eyes will see
When Your face is looking at me

Surrounded by Your glory, what will
My heart feel
Will I dance for You Jesus or in awe of You
Be still
Imagine, I can only imagine

I can only imagine all creation bowed down
The whole universe saying Your name out loud
I can only imagine all our broken lives
Resurrected in the healing light

Surrounded by Your glory, what will my
Heart feel
Will I dance for You Jesus or in awe of You
Be still
Will I stand in your presence or to my knees
Will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah, Will I be able to
Speak at all
I can only imagine, I can only imagine

Surrounded by forgiveness, what will my
Heart feel
Will I dance for You Jesus or in awe of
You be still
Will I stand in your presence or to my
Knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all

I can only imagine, Oh I can only imagine
I can only, I can only, I can only imagine
I can only imagine, just imagine
I can only imagine, imagine

Sing the wondrous love of Jesus
Sing His mercy and His grace
In the mansions bright and blessed
He'll prepare for us a place"
