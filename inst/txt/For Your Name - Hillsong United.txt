"1" "For Your Name
Hillsong United

We gotta a new life
in the light of Your love
Call by the name to the Saviour of all
We gotta a new song generations will sing
Ohohooh

We gotta a new home, all because of the cross
Saved by the grace that You've given to us
We gotta a new song all the nations will sing
ohohooh

Chorus
For Your name
Shines in all the earth
Great above all lives
Light of our salvation

Verse 2
For Your glory we will give all we are
all our lives for the love of Your son
we got a new song now we are redeemed
Ohohooh

Chorus
For Your name
Shines in all the earth
Great above all lives
Light of our salvation
Nations rise
Sing for the only One
Holy is Your name
Lifted high forever

Now hope is in
Our saviour's love
You gave it all
Let whole Earth sing
To Christ our king
Be lifted up"
