"1" "Breaking My Fall
Jeremy Camp

So easily I fall, so easily you reach your hand out
So quickly will I drown, in all the pools of all my reason
So easily will I fear, so easily will your peace surpass me
So quickly will I trust, in anything I think is worthy

How many times you make the waves calm down
So I won't be afraid now
I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall
What am I suppose to do

How precious are your thoughts
The way that you think about me
How faithful are your ways
I always feel you grace abounding
How quickly will I call
How quickly will you answer my cry
How carefully will you bring everything I need in my life

How many times you make the waves calm down
So I won't be afraid now
I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall
What am I suppose to do

This narrow road I'm walking,
This world will I try to draw
Your work will help me fight it
With you I'll face it all

I say you're breaking my, breaking my fall
What am I suppose to do"
