I know you hear this beat
it sound like somethin' to step with
But morals and your music, you want them separate
Like garnish on the side, somethin' y'all don't mess with
That Christo-centric rap, eclectic
You might like rap that's wild and reckless
A soap box for lots of young and restless
They got ya head bobbin' till ya lose ya necklace
Or better yet bobbin' till it leaves you neckless
You know where death is, where no more breath is
And 3rd graders learn how to leave you chestless
Where God is dissed, dismissed and distant
And far from their hearts cause they hard and wicked
Sin hates God for real
That's why He's rarely talked about
and He don't get the mass appeal
You might see sin blessin' a meal
That it eats while it cheats on the spouse
out seekin' a thrill

Hook
(Jai)
I'm free from sin
I win, I win
I'm free, I'm free
And no more chains are holdin' me
I'm free from death
Got power now, me kill the flesh
I'm free, I'm free
I'm gone, I'm gone

(Lecrae)
They walk in the church dressed flyer than sea birds
She came to see him, he hopin' to see her
They motives ain't right and they heart ain't either
Over God they choose to feed they fever
And he don't understand that it's Christ who bled for
Every second glance, every turn of his head yo
And she don't really get that Jesus did that
For everytime she fantasize about his six pack
They sure like Al B, to connect like his brows be
And with they bodies spit in God's face so foully
Sin's so bad, it's a liar
It says we on the throne, tells God to retire
It says He ain't enough, and it says we want more
It says He ain't just, it says He ain't Lord
Sin is the laugh at His power, the rape of His mercy
The mock of His patience, it says He ain't worthy

Hook

(Sho Baraka)
I been duped and been schemed
Like the Lord was cool with my sinning
Mockin' the cross living unrepented
My sinful ways kept us so distant
We know He's Lord and been king
Let Him run your life like a Simmons
Then you'll start loving His righteousness
And we start looking just like His kids

Hook

Bridge
(Sho Baraka)
Live free by His mercy and grace
Live free by His mercy and grace
and tell the world I'm gone
Live free by His patience and peace
Live free by His patience and peace
and tell the flesh I'm gone
Live free by His joy and love
Live free by His joy and love and tell the lust I'm gone
Live free by His truth and just
Live free by His truth and just and tell the hate I'm gone"
