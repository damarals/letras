"1" "I See You
Michael W. Smith

Lord' You're leadind me
With a cloud by day
And then in the night
The Glow of a burning flame

Chorus
And everywhere I Go I see You
everywhere I go I see You

And You take my Hande
And Wash it Clean
I Know the promised land
Is Light years ahead of me

Repeat Chorus

And the eagles flies
Ande the rivers run
I look throught the night
I can see the risin' sun

Repeat Chorus

Well, the grass will die
And flowers fall
But Your Word's alive
Will be after all

Repeat Chorus
