Take 6

Everybody wants to know
What the future has in store
Will you be or will you won’t
Where is that pot of gold?
When confusions got you bound
And it’s hard to make a sound
Just put your trust in me
I’m here to set you free

I’m here to set you free
Want to fill you with my love
I’m here to set you free
Want to fill you with my love

I don’t have a magic pill to give
But i can change the way you live
And just the place to start
Is deep inside your heart
If you give my love a chance
You will enjoy the dance
And if put your trust in me
I’m here to set you free

I’m here to set you free
Want to fill you with my love
I’m here to set you free
Want to fill you with my love

Sometimes life can knock you out
And keep you sleeping thru the count
But as long as i know that you’re rising to your knees
I will lift you off the canvas and set your mind at ease
I’ll set you free

I’m here to set you free
Want to fill you with my love
I’m here to set you free
Want to fill you with my love

I’m here to set you free
Want to fill you with my love
I’m here to set you free
Want to fill you with my love
Set you free"
