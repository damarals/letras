"1" "Mothers Of The Night
Delirious

Turn down the light,
Wait next to me,
Whisper a prayer,
Before you walk in to the night,
Momma don't cry,
When I sing you a song,
Momma don't weep,
For our freedom won't be long

Mother's of the night,
With your big brown eyes tonight,
Mother's of the night,
See you dancing in the light

Turn out my light,
And fall in to me,
Say all your prayers,
That god will save us from our plight,
Please for give our desperate ways,
But I'll die in this shame,
So my children live tonight

Mother's of the night,
With your crimson kiss so bright,
Mother's of the night,
Your father would be proud of you tonight

Wash me whiter than the snow,
I am guilty for my sin,
Wash me whiter than the snow,
I am guilty I threw the stone
Wash me whiter than the snow,
I am guilty for my sin
Wash me whiter than the snow,
I am guilty, 'cos I threw the stone
Guilty"
