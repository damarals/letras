"1" "When You Are Near
Jeremy Camp

There’s no need to say a thing when I’m before you.
In this silence I feel refreshed with peace.
Break this noise that binds the voice that tries to speak.
Open my eyes to see Your gracious, sovereign reach.

[CHORUS]
It’s hard to talk when I feel that You are near,
When all is quiet it’s the beauty that I hear.
This hidden place where I know that You've calmed my fears.
I know that You’ve washed my tears.

The seasons of change I’ve faced have never left me wounded.
Only scars of hurt, but never deeply rooted.
This healing I have felt, no burden can replace.
Redemptive hope has been the story of my pain.

[CHORUS]
It’s hard to talk when I feel that You are near,
When all is quiet it’s the beauty that I hear.
This hidden place where I know that You've calmed my fears.
I know that You’ve washed my tears.

All is lost without the breath of life You give, and You give so much.
I want nothing more than You, so here’s my heart

[CHORUS]
It’s hard to talk when I feel that You are near,
When all is quiet it’s the beauty that I hear.
This hidden place where I know that You've calmed my fears.
I know that You’ve washed my tears."
