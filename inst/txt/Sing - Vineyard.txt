Vineyard

Sing Canada India Asia sing
Mexico Africa dance and shout
Come on everyone around the world
You gotta let it out
Lift your voice and sing

I hear a rumbling
The earth's a-trembling
Cultures rising up
From the north the south
The east and the west
Creation sets the stage
The choir takes its place
No longer holding back
The part we all were meant to play
The dancers warming up
The song's almost begun
From every tribe and tongue
Let all the nations sing

Sing America Israel Russia sing
All of Europe and Brazil dance and shout
Come on everyone around the world
You gotta let it out
Lift your voice and sing
