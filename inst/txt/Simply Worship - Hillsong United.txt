"1" "Simply Worship
Hillsong United

I come to You in humble sacrifice
Hear my heart I worship
The cares of life I lay them at Your throne
With childlike faith I simply worship You

Verse 2:
No greater love has my heart ever known
In awe of You I worship
My spirit soars when my heart beats with Yours
Embraced in love I simply worship

Chorus:
Jesus how could I live without You
Jesus I simply worship You

Bridge:
Your love compels me to come
Into Your presence I will run

Chorus 2:
Jesus how could I live without You
Jesus I simply worship You"
