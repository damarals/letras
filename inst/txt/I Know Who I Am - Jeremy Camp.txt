"1" "I Know Who I Am
Jeremy Camp

I try so hard but I always fall short
So I've faced the truth of my weakness
There's nothing good that I can bring forth
But I stand in the strength of Your presence
I've wasted time always trying to face things alone
But I wait here now and I lay it all down

I know who I am and I know I'm not able
To stand on my own I can't live all alone
So I'm taking my hands and I'm reaching them out
And I fall down
For you I fall down

In times of brokenness always you show
The depth of love that you bring me
I'm kneeling down in your presence I know
You source of life I'm receiving
I place myself in your arms that will always lead me
And I won't let go cause there's nowhere else to go

I know who I am and I know I'm not able
To stand on my own I can't live all alone
So I'm taking my hands and I'm reaching them out
And I fall down
For you I fall down

Hey, I don't know why the things I want to do I always run from now
Because I know apart from you there's nothing that
I can do where life will become new

And I know who I am and I know I'm not able
To stand on my own, I can't live all alone
So I'm taking my hands and I'm reaching them out
And I know that I'll take everything that's in me
And I fall down for You, I fall down for You
And I fall down for You"
