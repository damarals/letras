"1" "Victory's Time
Ziza Fernandes

My sweet Lord
Now I offer you my pain
Living inside of me
That seems it’ll never end
When I cry
I don’t see anything beyond
In your hands I’ll hide my soul
So I can go on and live
You’re my trust
You can hear what I don’t say
Your holy voice makes alive
And warms up my heart
Even peace
Has already left my life
I’m tired of mistreating me
When I live without your grace
The victory
Comes beyond the holy cross
And nobody else can blame
What your love can touch, my Lord"
