"1" "You Are The Only One
Kirk Franklin

You are the only One who makes me feel this way
You turn my nights to day, Lord I just came to say

I tell You that You are the only One who came and
Took me in You’ve been that kind of friend, You’re
The only One You’re the One

You the are the One who makes me feel brand new
No other friend can give me joy so true in my darkest
hour I can call on You, You are the One

Can’t nobody do like You do sweet Jesus
[Shoo-boo-dooh-bop-du-weh]
