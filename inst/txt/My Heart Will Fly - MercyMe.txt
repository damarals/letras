"1" "My Heart Will Fly
MercyMe

Why this happened I cannot explain
Why write the script with such heartache and pain
Could there not have been an easier way

Watching life through this glass so faded
I cannot see the bigger picture taking place
Oh to understand one day

Chorus
My heart will fly
When I finally see you face to face
And my tears will fly
Away, away

It won’t be long until we all go home
With all things revealed and on that day we’ll finally know
Oh, as we are fully known

Chorus

Bridge
And what appears as incomplete
Is still completely Yours
And one day we’ll see as we’ve been seen
And we’ll soar

Chorus"
