"1" "What Kind Of Love
Amy Grant

Pour me some coffee
I've got an hour before I go
Tell me a secret
Tell me somethin' I don't know
Oh in this life
I need You more than You could know
To hold my hand
To be my friend
To hear you tell me once again

CHORUS/CORO:
What kind of love
Is a love that won't break down?
What kind of love
Honestly knows no bounds?
Hopes all things, believes all things
Never, never let me go
What kind of love?

I've got a new place
You've got a baby on the way
Time keeps on movin'
Seems like nothin' stays the same
Oh in this life
It can be hard to keep the faith
Some truth you hold
Some you let go
But in the end, you've got to know
What kind of love
Is a love that won't break down?
What kind of love
Honestly knows no bounds?
Hopes all things, believes all things
Never, never let me go
And what kind of love will still be here
When everythin' else has disappeared?
And what kind of love is strong enough to stand the test of time?
What kind of love
Is a love that won't break down?
What kind of love
Honestly knows no bounds?
Hopes all things, believes all things
Never, never let me go
What kind of love?
What kind of love?
What kind of love?"
