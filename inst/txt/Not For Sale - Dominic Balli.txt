"1" "Not For Sale
Dominic Balli

We are not for sale
We are not for sale
We are not for sale
We are not for sale

You can't put a price on a human life
It's not mine to sell it's not yours to buy
All came from the dirt and we'll return to earth
Who are we to decide another man's worth
Created equal without social status
Without social systems of cast or classes
It's even scales as far as I can tell
We didn't make mankind it's not ours to sell
How's this for pathetic down right ironic
The land of the free
And the slave owners run it
Shipping drugs to the drug lords
Girls to the strip clubs
Boys to the fields and guns to the gang wars
It's blasphemous

We write in God we trust
On a hundred dollar bill to fulfill a man's lust
More slave's today than transatlantic slave trade
Underground genocide sending youth to their grave

Do we even know the truth
? Bout the clothes that we choose
Made by slaves and the food we consume
I'm right there with you I never knew
So here's twenty two to name just a few

Coffee and cotton
Chocolate and diamonds
Gold rings rubies
Just like the movies
Sugarcane and charcoal
Paper and gravel
Cell phones, pornography
Carpets and cattle
The rice in my fryer
The rubber on my tires
Tea and tobacco
Granite for my castle
Silk for my linen
Buttons for my denim
Sneakers for my feet
Worth more than human

Yep you heard right for the price of some Nikes
You could own a girl's freedom sex slave for life
The worst part
You didn't think twice
Still the fact remains
She aint your to buy"
