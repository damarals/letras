Lecrae

(hook)
I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
I'm angry, I'm fighting, I'm busting, I'm poppin'
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry, I'm hating, I'm pushing, I'm shoving
Somebody better get me cos I'm 'bout to do something
I'm angry

(verse 1)
Been up all night
Got me feeling weak
No sleep on the first day of a long week
I guess I'm still in school
These people testing me
For disrespecting me I will respond aggressively
A long day short fuse in the worst mood
My temper red hot
I will get these boys blues
Hard livin got me feelin very selfish
Crab in a bucket tryin' crush these other shellfish
Forget the chip upon my shoulder man I carry boulders
I don't know how to control them when they get to rollin'
When people pop off at the mouth I try to keep the cool
But all I wanna do is fix 'em, troubleshoot
Yeah they say I'm wrong
If this carries on
The faith I claim to have
I'll probably never own
Empty waiting pool
Running out of patience
This is anger management get me another agent

(verse 2)
I'm angry every morning before I get up off the bed
This dog keep on barkin I'ma bust em in the head
Uncle keep on trippin if he want to he can get it too
Anybody say another word I'ma act the fool
I hit the dough, push my fitted to the side
Heart full of pride
Anger in my eyes
Been this way since the day I seen my homie die
Now I'm mad at the world and I hate that I'm alive
Really hate to say it cos it's killing me inside
All I wanna be is loved and it's eating me alive
Don't nobody love me man my momma and my daddy don't
My uncle ain't my uncle cos I'm living in a foster home
I say I'm saved but I'm scared of the truth
Cos I read galatians 5 and I didn't see the fruit
I don't know what else to do, I don't know what else to say
So I hit my knees and pray, god take this thing away

(verse 3)
I would die for my respect
But I got no humility
And jesus paid my debt while
I reject him willingly
Man I got some nerve
Holding anger in my heart
The father could have come serve me that beef up a la carte
Not to mention torture, jesus took all my misfortune
I’ve been freed from the law, but I'm serving these court orders
Unforgiveness is my pedigree, you say you’re sorry better be
Better bein' mad at you, than try'na be a better me
Ain't nothin' in my workin' tryna demonstrate his worth
And though he show me plenty grace, I don't extend to other persons
And that anger led to murder, when you pull up on that murder scene
It's jesus nailed upon that cross, yeah the murderer was me"
