"1" "Standing in The Storm
Skillet

I still got some life in me
You can try to shake me
I still got some fight in me
But you can never break me

I see the clouds around me start to darken
Like searching eyes of serpents always watching
Tell me I'm still breathin' (breathin')
Tell me there's still feelin' (feeling)
Resistance makes me stronger
It makes me stronger

Time for me to be defiant
Cuz I won't be silencеd when I suffer
Slinging shots at Goliath
Gonna call down fire in rain and thundеr

I see the world around me start to darken
Resistance makes me stronger
So make me stronger

Whatever comes

I'm Standing in the storm
Like never before
The pressure builds around me
Let the winds surround me

Whatever comes
I'm not givin' up
Fearless as lion
Not afraid of dying

I still got some life in me
You can try to shake me
I still got some fight in me
But you can never break me

Standing in the storm
Like never before
The pressure builds around me
Let the winds surround me
I'll stand in the storm
I still got some life in me
I'll stand in the storm
I'll still got some fight in me

I feel the voices underneath me calling
I sink into the graveyard of the fallen
Tell me that you hear them (hear them)
Tell me you don't fear them (fear them)
Resist a little longer
Death before dishonor

Nothing left to be decided
Cause I won't be quiet when they threaten
Through the hate and the violence
Got truth on my side and love's my weapon

I feel the voices underneath me calling
Resist a little longer
Death before dishonor

Slinging shots at Goliath
Slinging shots at Goliath
Time for me to be defiant

I still got some life in me
You can try to shake me
I still got some fight in me"
