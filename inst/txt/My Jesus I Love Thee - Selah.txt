"1" "My Jesus I Love Thee
Selah

My Jesus I love Thee I know Thou art mine.
For Thee all the follies of sin I resign.
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou.
If ever I loved Thee my Jesus tis now.

I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me.
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree.
I love Thee for wearing thy thorns on Thy brow.
If ever I loved Thee my Jesus tis now.

In mansions of Glory and endless delight.
I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright.
I'll sing with the glittering crown upon my brow.
If ever I loved Thee my Jesus tis now."
