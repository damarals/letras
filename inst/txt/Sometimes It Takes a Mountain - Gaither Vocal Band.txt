"1" "Sometimes It Takes a Mountain
Gaither Vocal Band

I faced a mountain
That I never faced before
That's why I'm calling on the lord
I know it's been awhile
But Lord please hear my prayer
I need you like I never have before

Sometimes it takes a mountain
Sometimes a troubled sea
Sometimes it takes a desert
To get a hold of me
Your love is so much stronger
Then whatever troubles me
Sometimes it takes a mountain
To trust you and believe

Forgive me Jesus
I thought I could control
Whatever life would throw my way
But this I will admit
Has brought me to my knees
I need you lord and I'm not ashamed to say

Sometimes it takes a mountain
Sometimes a troubled sea
Sometimes it takes a desert
To get a hold of me
Your love is so much stronger
Then whatever troubles me
Sometimes it takes a mountain
To trust you and believe"
