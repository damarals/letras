Hillsong United

Amazing love has won my heart
I am in awe of all You've done
You gave us Jesus and with Him
You freely give us everything

Amazing love sets me free
From all that would weigh down on me
You are my strength, my help, my friend
And my hope - life without end

Father, my Father I am so secure in You
Your perfect love drives away all my fear
Father I love You for You have loved me first
And I am grateful for amazing love"
