"1" "Trials And Tribulations
MÃºsicas Gospel

God's angels will be singing,
When his final bell is ringing.
The thunder will fill the skies,
There'll be tears in many eyes.

God's warnings had gone out,
His words had left no doubt.
The Bible said what he'd do,
And his word is always true.

Chorus:
Trials and tribulations,
Is what the Bible said.
But some of the people,
Couldn't get it in their head.
The end that they'll face,
Is one that I won't see.
Because I paid attention,
To what his words said to me.

As the fire falls from above,
They will cry for God's love.
Many tears will be cried,
From the lost and terrified.

There's not a thing God can do,
Even if he wanted to.
He warned the end would come,
Before the deed was done.

Chorus:
Trials and tribulations,
Is what the Bible said.
But some of the people,
Couldn't get it in their head.
The end that they'll face,
Is one that I won't see.
Because I paid attention,
To what his words said to me."
