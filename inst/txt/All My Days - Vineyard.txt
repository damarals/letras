"1" "All My Days
Vineyard

You are the reason I can wake up
And forget about the past
You are the reason I can face tomorrow
Knowing I'll be holding Your hand

You have been so good to me
You have been so good to me

All my days I will praise You
I lift my song up to Your throne
All my days I will follow
I give my heart to You alone"
