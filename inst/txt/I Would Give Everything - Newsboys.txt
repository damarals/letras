"1" "I Would Give Everything
Newsboys

i would give everything
to give nothing more
i would give everything
to give nothing more

walk outside you're standing in the rain
eyes collide we both know i'm to blame
see me cry feel like judas for awhile
absolution i'm feeling so tired

bygones by you took away the blame
this humanity haunts me
everyday i feel ashamed

how long till everything is new
how long till our bodies are renewed
how long till we see you face to face
how long till we reach that perfect place
