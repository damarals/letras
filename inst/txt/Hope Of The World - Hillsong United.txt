"1" "Hope Of The World
Hillsong United

For the love poured out
For the price of freedom
Let the whole earth sing
Hear the praises rising

We stand in awe of what you've done for us
At the cross

The hope of the world
Lifted on high
Calling us home
With arms out wide
To know you forever
To love you forever
You are our everything"
