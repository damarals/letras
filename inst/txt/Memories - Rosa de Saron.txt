Rosa de Saron

My day has gone
The night is bringing
Memories of past
Memories of you
Don't think that I've forgotten you
I'm right here

Sleepless and cold
It's 4:10
Only 4:10 at dawn
It's all right
I'm drinking a coffee
I get up
Open the window
And I scream out loud, loudly

Wherever you are
I will be
Hoping that you will
Be waiting for me
And you must be sure
I'm really your friend
Forever your friend
I'm very glad

It's only midday
Of a rainy weekend
I was in bed
But I woke up
Put on some pants
I pack my bags
Grab my old guitar
Look, I'm right behind you

Where you are
I will be
Hoping that you will be waiting for me
And you must be sure
I'm really your friend
Forever your friend
I'm so glad

Then I realized
That the peace I didn't have
Was here inside
And I was lost in a castle of illusions
And with my mind clear
I'm coming back home
Because today I live

'Cause where you are
I will be
Hoping that you will be waiting for me
And you must be sure
I'm really your friend
Forever friend
I'm very glad

Yeah, there was a castle of illusion
In a castle of illusion"
