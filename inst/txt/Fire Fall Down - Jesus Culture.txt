Chorus 1:
Cause I know that You’re alive
You came to fix my broken life
And I sing to glorify
Your holy Name
Jesus Christ

Verse 1:
You bought my life
with the Blood that You shed on the cross
When You died for the sins of men
And You let out a cry
Crucified now alive in me

Verse 2:
These hands are Yours
Teach them to serve as You please
And I’ll reach out desperate to see
All the greatness of God
May my soul rest assured in You

PreChorus:
I’ll never be the same
No I’ll never be the same

Chorus 2:
‘Cause I know that You’re alive
You came to fix my broken life
And I sing to glorify
Your holy Name
Jesus Christ

Verse 3:
You’ve changed it all
You broke down the wall
When I spoke and confessed
In You I’m blessed
Now I walk in the light
In victorious sight of You

Bridge:
Your fire fall down
Fire fall down
On us we pray, As we seek
Your fire fall down.
Fire fall down
On us we pray, as we seek (repeat 4x)

Show me Your heart
Show me Your way
Show me Your glory
Show me Your heart
Show me Your way
Show me Your glory (repeat 5x)"
