"1" "I Am My Beloved's
Diante do Trono

With all my heart I’m waiting for You
Your holy fragrance I want to feel once again…2x

I call your name, Jesus, I’m longing for You
I call your name, Jesus, I’m longing for You

Your love is better than wine
Let me lose myself in your arms…2x

I am my beloved’s, I am my beloved’s
I am my beloved’s and He is mine

With all my heart I’m waiting for You
Your holy fragrance I want to feel once again…2x

I call your name, Jesus, I’m longing for You
I call your name, Jesus, I’m longing for You

Your words are sweeter than honey
You’re the one my soul desires…2x

Let me lay down at your feet
Give you all I am, all of me
I’m running to the place where
It will be only You and me"
