"1" "Jonah's Song
Alessandra Samadello

I didn’t want to go, I didn’t want to preach
I didn’t want to see, all the suffering on the streets
They needed me to go, they needed me to preach
People on the street, they needed me, they needed me

“Go, servant, go!, understand my love
Look inside you, look around you, love is the only way
Go, servant, go!, please, don’t hesitate
Love can save hearts, love can build lives, love is the only way”

God told me: “Go and save, my hand will keep you safe
Go Jonah, go and tell them to be different, to repent”
I didn’t want to see that God had chosen me
I was so afraid, I ran away, I ran away

“Go, servant, go!, understand my love
Look inside you, look around you, love is the only way
Go, servant, go!, please, don’t hesitate
Love can save hearts, love can build lives, love is the only way”

I ran away, he brought me back
I turned my face away again
But nothing else would change his mind
Because my God had chosen me

“Go, servant, go!, understand my love
Go, servant, go!, understand my love
Look inside you, look around you, love is the only way
Go, servant, go!, please, don’t hesitate
Love can save hearts, love can build lives
Love can save hearts, love can build lives, love is the only way
Love is the only way”."
