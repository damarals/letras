"1" "Now Is The Time
Hillsong United

Verse:
This love, this hope
This peace of God
This right - eous - ness
This faith, this joy
This life complete in me


Verse 2:
Now healed and whole
And risen in His right - eous - ness
I live in Him
He lives in me
And filled with this hope in God
Reflecting His glory


Chorus:
Now is the time to worship You
Now is the time to offer You
All of my thoughts, my dreams and plans
I lay it down
Now is the time to live for You
Now is the time I'm found in You
Now is the time Your Kingdom come
