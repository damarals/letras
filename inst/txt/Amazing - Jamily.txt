You'll never change, you never will
I love the way you make me feel
You're amazing
I wake up my soul
Let up my world
Changing everything at once, for a new
You're amazing

(Bridge I)

Come walk with me
Stay with me
Never let me go
I'll never let you go
Come touch me
Stay with me
True it all, true it all

(Chorus)

You're all, you're all I need you, are
Everything you are
Almight amazing

(Bridge Ii)

There's no better a place to be
Then right next to you, right next to you"
