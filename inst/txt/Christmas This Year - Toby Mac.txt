"x"
"1" "Christmas This Year
Toby Mac

As fall rides off in the Sunset
I sweep the Snow from my doorstep
I just can't help but Stop and Grin
It's like I'm Ten Years old again

And Everywhere I go I can feel it
Some say it moves like a Spirit
It falls on us once a Year
Like it came on a Midnight clear
It's all Love

The Season is a Gift
When Love came down to let us Live
Let's open up and let our Hearts embrace this Moment
For Christmas This Year
Gonna make a Sound
Gonna make it Loud
For Christmas This Year

We're gonna make some Noise
Let the World rejoice
For Christmas This Year
For Christmas
For Christmas This Year
The Laughter starts before the Sunrise

I sneak downstairs at the Sparklin' Lights
And, oh, what Joy it brings to me
Our Family around our Christmas Tree
And I thank the Lord for His favor
As we sing the songs of the Savior
Our Savior

It's all Love
The Season is a Gift
When Love came down to let us Live
Let's open up and let our Hearts embrace this Moment
For Christmas This Year

Gonna make a Sound
Gonna make it Loud
For Christmas This Year
We're gonna make some Noise

Let the World rejoice
For Christmas This Year
For Christmas
For Christmas This Year

Holy, Holy, Holy
God is coming Near
Unto us a Savior born
On a Midnight clear

Holy, Holy, Holy
God is coming Near
Unto us a Savior born
On a Midnight clear

Oh...
For Christmas This Year
Gonna make a Sound
Gonna make it Loud
For Christmas This Year

We're gonna make some Noise
Let the World rejoice
For Christmas This Year
For Christmas

For Christmas This Year
For Christmas This Year
Gonna make a Sound
Gonna make it Loud

For Christmas This Year
We're gonna make some Noise
Let the World rejoice
For Christmas This Year

For Christmas
For Christmas This Year
Holy, Holy, Holy (For Christmas This Year)
God is coming Near (For Christmas This Year)

Unto us a Savior born
On a Midnight Clear"
