I come to You, my God
The joy of my salvation,
In You I put my trust. And though I walk through valleys low,
I will fear no evil.

Your love endures forever,
Reaches to the heavens.
And though my flesh may fail me,
You’re the strength of my heart, You will always be.
I know Your loving kindness,
The power of forgiveness.
All that I hold dear is Yours.
My Jesus, it’s You I long for.

I love Your Name, Oh Lord,
I’ll sing Your praises eternally.
My life is in Your hands, and when darkness tries to cover me,
I will ever give You praise. I will ever glorify"
