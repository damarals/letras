"1" "Could He Be the Messiah
Michael W. Smith

Words:Deborah D. Smith
Music: Michael W. Smith

Been here for days, I'm amazed (at) this teacher, carpenter, preacher
Lost in the crowd, I hear him now, he's praying and he's saying, \"God feed them all\"
Five-thousand men, al of his friends are worried find bread and hurry
Five loaves and fish, what can he wish, he's praying still he's saying, \"God feed them all\"
Chorus:
Could he be the messiah?
Miracle man, part of the plan
Could he be the messiah?
Life in his hand,
I understand he could be....

Meet for our needs fully he feeds our hunger older and younger
Twelve baskets more, can we ignore, he shows us that he knows us, is he the Christ?
God in his eyes, I realize his power, need of the hour
Jesus is his name, they say he came to feed us and to receive us, is he the Christ?

Chorus

It is he the messiah!
Miracle man, part of the plan
It is he the messiah!
Life in his hand
I understand it is he

Chorus
