"1" "Your Amazing Love
Vineyard

Whisper in my ear
Tell me one more time
The words I long to hear, that I
I am forgiven

Hold me in Your arms
Draw me next to You
Safely by Your side, I know
That I am forgiven

Chorus:
And I will never truly know just
Why You love me Lord
I am so broken and so desperate
Still You love me more
Lord, I love Your amazing love

There's beauty in the way
You cherish and embrace me
In all my brokenness, I know
That I am forgiven

Bridge:
And I lift my hands
In worship at your throne
And I raise my heart
So thankful Lord for what You've done"
