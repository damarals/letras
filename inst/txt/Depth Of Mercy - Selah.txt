"1" "Depth Of Mercy
Selah

Depth of mercy, can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God His wrath forbear me
The chief of sinners, spare?

Heaven find me on my knees
Hear my soul in passioned pleas
Depth of mercy, can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?

Now incline me to repent
Let me now my sins lament
Deeply my revolt deplore
Weep, believe and sin no more

Heaven find me on my knees
Hear my soul in passioned pleas
Depth of mercy, can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?

Heaven find me on my knees
Hear my soul in passioned pleas
Depth of mercy, can there be
Mercy still reserved, mercy still reserved
Mercy still reserved for me?"
