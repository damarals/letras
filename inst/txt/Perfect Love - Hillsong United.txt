"1" "Perfect Love
Hillsong United

I want to see the broken hearts,
Finding hope in God above,
I want to know, I'm doing all I can,
So with this life, with all I am,
No matter what the cost may be,
I pray to see your love become our cause,

I wont stop believing,
You alone are, you alone are God,
In you there's freedom

Chorus

Your love brings me to my knees again,
We're gonna bring an anthem of love,
We're gonna live for you now

This perfect love, I can't explain,
This way of life that has no end,
The mercy satisfies, it's all I need,
My purpose found in you alone,
To love the lost and bring them home,
That we were made to glorify our King

I won't stop believing,
You alone are, you alone are God,
In you there's freedom

Chorus

Your love brings me to my knees again,
We're gonna bring an anthem of love,
We're gonna live for you,
May your love, become our every thought,
I want to learn the sound of your heart,
I want to live for you now

Bridge

For you, for you, it's all for you, it's all for you,
Singing you, you bring me life, you bring me hope, you're all I need"
