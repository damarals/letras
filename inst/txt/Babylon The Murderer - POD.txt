"1" "Babylon The Murderer
P.O.D.

Tell the world
Tell the whole world that you keep nothing back,
Hold nothing back
Raise a single flag
Raise it to tell everyone that babylon will fall

Her images and idols will be broken and destroyed,
Will be broken and destroyed

Yeah, ha

Babylon is a murderer
Crash down through your walls
Bring lightning thunder
Pull the trigger and light you up
In a world so fake, we come dangerous

And your gods will be shattered
Absolutely discredited
Perfectly dead and shamed
For a nation will come down from the north
With such destruction, and desolation
And bring it all to an end
Such death and demolition
Such death and devastation
That no one will ever live there again

Yeah, ha

Babylon is a murderer
Crash down through your walls
Bring lightning thunder
Pull the trigger and light you up
In a world so fake, we come dangerous

Pull the trigger

And as we sat down,
By the rivers of babylon
We wept, and we wept
And we remembered, and we remembered zion

Pull the trigger

Babylon is a murderer
Crash down through the ground
Like lightning thunder
Pull the trigger and light you up
In a world so fake, we come dangerous"
