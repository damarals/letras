"1" "Breakthrough
Britt Nicole

Hey there, fear
I've seen you here before
You keep comin' back
And knockin' at my door
For so long, so long
I've been tryin' to soar
With my hands tied up and my feet held to the floor

But I'm feelin' like a breakthrough is comin'
I can see that a breakthrough is comin', comin' for me
'Cuz my heart, it was made to fly
Destiny can't be denied
I'm tired of waiting
I am overdue for a breakthrough

You used to have me stumblin'
Yeah, trippin' again and again
But I've been studyin' you
And now I know you like the back of my hand
You can't keep me here
I've cried too many tears
Yeah, I've had enough
Now I'm gonna call your bluff
You mande your bet, but the stage is set
Get ready 'cuz I'm lightin' the fuse

But I'm feelin' like a breakthrough is comin'
I can see that a breakthrough is comin', comin' for me
'Cuz my heart, it was made to fly
Destiny can't be denied
I'm tired of waiting
I am overdue for a break-break-breakthrough
Break-break-breakthrough

I can feel a breakthrough comin'
I can feel a breakthrough comin'
I can feel a breakthrough comin'
I can feel a breakthrough comin'"
