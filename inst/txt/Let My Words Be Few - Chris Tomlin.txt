"1" "Let My Words Be Few
Chris Tomlin

You are God in heaven
And here am I on earth,
So I'll let my words be few
Jesus I am so in love with You.

And I'll stand in awe of You,
Yes I'll stand in awe of You,
And I'll let my words be few
Jesus I am so in love with You.

The simplest of all love songs
I want to bring to You,
So I'll let my words be few
Jesus I am so in love with You."
