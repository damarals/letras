"1" "Heart Of The Heavens
Vineyard

Lonely desert below
Barren soil 'neath the sky
Only death in the wind
Every echo is dry

Hills and valleys on fire
Mere memories of life
Parched and thirsty by day
No relief in the night

Hunger cries in the heart
Groanings reach up, touching heaven
Buried hopes start to tremble and breathe again
Deep longing is heard
All waiting will cease
For the Heart of the heavens is love

The sky smiles on the earth
Releases living rains
Great clouds of mercy empty
One gives, one gains
And both are satisfied
The desert and the sky
For the Heart of the heavens is love

Such tears of grace pour
Streams swell into a river
Wonder of divine reflection
The needy and the Giver

And both are satisfied
The desert and the sky
For the Heart of the heavens
The God of the heavens
For the Heart of the heavens is love"
