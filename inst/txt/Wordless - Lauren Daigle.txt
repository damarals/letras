"1" "Wordless
Lauren Daigle

There isn't any fear here
There isn't any fear in love
When You come
When You come

There isn't any heart here
That You don't wanna overwhelm
When You come
When You come

I am speechless, but I can't keep quiet
And I am wordless, but I can't stay silent

There isn't any rush here
So I'm just gonna wait on You
And linger longer
'Cause every time I find You
I'm a little more undone
When You come
When You come

Woah, I'm lost for words to say
Woah, You take my breath away

You move me, and I can't define it
You consume me, and I can't describe it
I am speechless, but I can't keep quiet
And I am wordless, but I can't stay silent, silent

There isn't any fear here
There isn't any fear in love"
