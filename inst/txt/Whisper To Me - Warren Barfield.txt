"1" "Whisper To Me
Warren Barfield

I lay down
And I close my eyes
But I won't go to sleep tonight
There's too much on my mind
Holy God
You seem to be twice as far away from me
Than you have ever been before

CHORUS:
Hold me safely in Your arms
And clear my crowded mind
And whisper words of peace
In the dark
Whisper to me
Oh, whisper

I'm afraid but they don't know it
I feel so weak
But I can't show it
So here I lay
Crying out with hears

CHORUS:
Hold me gently in Your arms
And calm my beating heart
And whisper words of hope
In the dark
Whisper to me
Oh, whisper

BRIDGE:
Whisper
Make the day sleep
Make the noise cease
And give me peace
Whisper to me
How I need to hear You whisper
Whisper to me
Oh, Whisper

CHORUS:
Hold me gently in Your arms
And calm my beating heart
And whisper words of hope
In the dark
Whisper to me
Words of hope
Words of peace
Whisper to me"
