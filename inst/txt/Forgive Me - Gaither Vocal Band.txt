"1" "Forgive Me
Gaither Vocal Band

Forgive me, I'm so sorry
Forgive me, I've been so wrong
First I hurt You and drove You away
Then pride kept me silent when I needed to say.

Forgive me, I'm so sorry
I need You, I always will
This hole in my heart Lord, only You can fill
Forgive me, please take me home.

The trust that's been shattered
Love can restore
And time will heal
Our broken heart.

Forgive me, I'm so sorry
I love You, I need You so
Moments are fragile, let's hold them close
Forgive me, please take me home.

Forgive me, I'm so sorry
Forgive me, I've been so wrong
This hole in my heart Lord, only You can fill
Forgive me, please take me home.

Forgive me."
