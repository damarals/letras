"1" "This Is My Father's World
Youthful Praise

...as sung by amy grant
This is my father's world. O let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the ruler yet.
This is my father's world: why should my heart be sad?
The Lord is king; let the heavens ring!
God reigns; let the earth be glad!
This is my father's world: he shines in all that's fair;
In the rustling grass I hear him pass;
He speaks to me everywhere.
In the rustling grass I hear him pass;
He speaks to me everywhere."
