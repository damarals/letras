"1" "What This World Needs
Casting Crowns

What this world needs
Is not another one hit wonder with another ax to grind
Another two bit politician peddling lives
Another three ring circus society

What this world needs
Is not another sign waving super saint who's better than you
Another ear pleasing candy man afraid of the truth
Another prophet in an Armani suit

What this world needs
Is a Savior who will rescue
A Spirit who will lead
A Father who will love them
In their time of need

A Savior who will rescue
A Spirit who will lead
A Father who will love
That's what this world needs

What this world needs
Is for us to care more about the inside, than the outside
If we become so blind that we can't see
God's gotta change our heart before He changes our shirt

What this world needs
Is for us to stop hiding behind our relevance
When we mean so well
That people can't see the difference
And it's the difference that sets the world free

What this world needs
Is a Savior who will rescue
A Spirit who will lead
A Father who will love them
In their time of need

A Savior who will rescue
A Spirit who will lead
A Father who will love
That's what this world needs

People aren't confused by the Gospel
They are confused by us
Jesus is the only way to God
But we are not the only way to Jesus
This world doesn't need my tie, my hoodie,
My denomination or my translation of the Bible
They just need Jesus
We can be passionate about what we believe
But we can't strap ourselves to the Gospel
Because we are slowing it down
Jesus is going to save the world
But maybe the best thing we can do
Is just get out of the way

What this world needs
Is a Savior who will rescue
A Spirit who will lead
A Father who will love them
In their time of need

A Savior who will rescue
A Spirit who will lead
A Father who will love
That's what this world needs
Jesus is our Savior
That's what this world needs
The Father's arms around you
That's what this world needs
That's what this world needs"
