"1" "Love Is The Compass
Delirious

I tried to save the world but it fell
upon my shoulders,
I couldn't stop the sun, now it's
only getting colder.
Falling down, be there for me when
I start to drown.

Chorus:
Your love,
It is the compass of my heart,
Your love,
It is the thing that let me start.

I'm gazing at the Son,
Keeps me younger now I'm older
But we've only just begun,
Feel Your hand upon my shoulder.
Sing it loud, all we need is fire and
The cloud

Chorus

I've been left, I'm alright,
Cos' freedom points me to the light,
I've not been left, cos' I'm alright."
