Hillsong United

I was lost
I was afraid
Until u found me and u took me by the hand

I was bound
I was in chains
Until u came and set me free to dance again

NOW I'M SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS:
WHOOOOAH

U are good
I know
I'll shout it from the rooftops
U are good
I know
And ur love will go forever
U ARE GOOD

I was lost
I was afraid
Until u found me and u took me by the hand

I was bound
I was in chains
Until u came and set me free to dance again

NOW I'M SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS:
WHOOOOAH

U are good
I know
I'll shout it from the rooftops
U are good
I know
And ur love will go forever
U ARE GOOD

I was blind but now I see
From the rooftops I 'll sing
I was bound but now I'm free

I was blind but now I see
From the rooftops I 'll sing
I was bound but now I'm free

I was blind but now I see
From the rooftops I 'll sing
I was bound but now I'm free

U are good
I know
I'll shout it from the rooftops
U are good
I know
And ur love will go forever

U are good
I know
I'll shout it from the rooftops
U are good
I know
And ur love will go forever
U ARE GOOD

U ARE GOOOD
