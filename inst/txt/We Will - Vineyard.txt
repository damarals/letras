Vineyard

We sing praises to You Lord
We worship and adore
We praise Your name forevermore
(2x)

Let our melodies be sweet in Your throne room
Let our melodies be sweet to You

Chorus:
We will
Lift our hands in highest praise
We will
Bow our knees before Your throne
We will
Come and worship You
With all our hearts
We will

Bridge:
With all our hearts, with all our strength
With all our minds and with all our lives
(repeat)"
