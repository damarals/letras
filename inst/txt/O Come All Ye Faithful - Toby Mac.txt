"1" "O Come All Ye Faithful
Toby Mac

O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem, Bethlehem
O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
Come let us adore Him, Come let us adore Him,
Come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord
Come let us adore Him, Come let us adore Him,
Come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord
O sing, choirs of angels, O sing in exultation
O sing, all ye bright hosts of heav'n above
Glory to God sing
(repeat chorus)
(Come let's adore Him, bow down before Him)
Come let's adore him, one voice one people
(repeat chorus)"
