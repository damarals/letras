"1" "A Passion Burning
For Today

Do you have a passion?
Find something that you love
Run with it, don't stop for anyone else
No one can get you down
You are better than that
Fight for your passion
Be knowledgeable of your roots
and proud of what you've become
If what you love reflects yourself inside out
It is not a trend
So many people will never find true life
and all the passion that can flow from it
Everyone is so quick to judge
All just so quick to judge
But while they're just watching
We'll run past them.
