"1" "Sanctify
Delirious

Here i am in that old place again
Down on my face again
Crying out i want you to hear my plea
Come down and rescue me

How long will it take
How long will i have to wait?

(Chorus)
Cause all i want is all you have
Come to me, rescue me,
Fall on me with your love
And all You want is all I have
Come to me, rescue me,
Fall on me with your love

Sanctify i want to be set apart
Right to the very heart
Prophesy to the four winds
And breathe life to this very place

How long will it take
How long will i have to wait?
(Repeat chorus)

Lifted up i've climbed with the strength i have
Right to this mountain top
Looking out the cloud's getting bigger now
It's time to get ready now.

How long will it take?
How long will I have to wait?
(repeat chorus)"
