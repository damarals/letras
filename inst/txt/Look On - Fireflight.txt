"1" "Look On
Fireflight

This morning I sat to read the paper
The fog was lifting a little late
Each day someone was dying
And that's all I seem to notice

Lord Separate me from this mess
The world is dying its just that clear
The separation of You from us
Its killing me, its killing us

Look on
Forward to the end
Press on
Cause this time we won't be stopped

Forgiveness in You is the next hardest thing
Then giving your life for strangers
A lasting impression can fuel this move
And love will always over come

Look on
Forward to the end
Press on
Cause this time we won't be stopped

Look on
Forward to the end
Press on
Cause this time we won't be stopped

Look on
Forward to the end
Press on
Cause this time we won't be stopped"
