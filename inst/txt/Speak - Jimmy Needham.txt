"x"
"1" "Speak
Jimmy Needham

We mostly keep to ourselves 'round here
No sense rockin' the boat 'round here
We watch you dance into hell 'round here
It's time we speak his mind 'round here

Oh, so open your mouth, open it wide
Quit singing songs for a minute tonight
You can love with your hands
You can love with your deeds
How will they know if they know If we don't even speak?

We are the social workers
And we'll put springs on your car
We'll make your ride so smooth, yes we will
That you'll forget where you are
Don't forget where you are

So open your mouth, open it wide
Quit singing songs for a minute tonight
You can love with your hands
You can love with your deeds
How will they know if we don't even speak?

Cause I'm getting sick and I'm getting tired
I'm not even hearing us preach to the choir

So open your mouth, open it wide
Quit singing songs for a minute tonight

You can love with your hands
You can love with your deeds
How will they know if we won't even speak?

Open your mouth, open it wide
Quit singing songs for a minute tonight
You can love with your hands
You can love with your deeds
How will they know
If we don't even, won't even, don't even speak"
