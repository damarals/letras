"x"
"1" "No Matter What
Rosa de Saron

You could give me a broad smile
And there is nothing else to add
Today I live without emptiness
Now everything has sense

If my patience far away goes
I can hear 'Stay a little longer'
The deep eco that your voice makes
Gives more reasons to be, so well

Everything I have
To you I give, no matter what
Everything you have
I want to be mine
No matter what

And this way I live happily
I have only changed the way I see
And this little has become a lot to me
I can't never forget, I can't
Where I came from and who I am
It's that I returned
I learned on the road the price that I paid
For everything not lived"
