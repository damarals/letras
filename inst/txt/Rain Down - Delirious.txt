Delirious

Looks like tonight, the sky is heavy
feels like the winds, are gonna change
Beneath my feet, the Earth is ready
I know it's time, for heavens rain.
It's gonna rain, yeah yeah

Cause living water we desire,
to flood our hearts with holy fire

Rain down, all around the world we're singing
Rain down, can you hear the Earth is singing
Rain down, my heart is dry but still i'm singing
Rain down, rain it down on me.

Back to the start, my heart is heavy
Feels like it's time, to dream again
I see the clouds, and yes i'm ready
To dance upon, this barren land
Hope in my hands, yeah yeah

Cause living water we desire,
to flood our hearts with holy fire

Rain down, all around the world we're singing
Rain down, can you hear the Earth is singing
Rain down, my heart is dry but still i'm singing
Rain down, rain it down

Do not shut, do not shut, do not shut, the heavens
But open up, open up, open up, our hearts

Rain down, all around the world we're singing
Rain down

(Rain down) Give me strength to cross this water,
keep my heart upon your altar, rain down
(Rain down) Give me strength to cross this water
keep my feet, don't let me falter, rain down

(Hey,'ey,'ey)

Do not shut the heavens
But open up our hearts, open up our hearts,
Do not shut the heavens
But open up our hearts, open up my heart."
