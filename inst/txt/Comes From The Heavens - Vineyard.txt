"1" "Comes From The Heavens
Vineyard

You're looking for something
Its on your mind but it is so unclear
Shape the question and in time
It will be answered
You'll find the key that you hide away

You're bringing your history
But there's a time that has shaped the lines
Shaped your future it is pride
You're using your mind, and your beauty
You'll be fine

A new life, a sign
That comes from the heavens
Take a step His way you'll find a freedom
Take a breath this night
You'll rise above the seasons of your life
You'll find a reason

You're running in circles
Most of your life you have made your way
But where are you now?
You're in a place
That could not be better
Won't you show your face?"
