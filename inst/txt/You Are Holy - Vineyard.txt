"1" "You Are Holy
Vineyard

Beauty wakes every place You go
Peace surrounds every truth You show
In Your life I find my freedom

Tenderness spoken through Your touch
Mercy's kiss granted from Your love
In Your eyes I find my healing

You are holy
You are holy
And our praise surrounds Your throne
You are holy
You are holy
And we worship You alone
I bend my knee and I adore You

Selflessness marks Your act of love
God in flesh humbled on a cross
By Your blood I find my meaning

(BRIDGE)
Holy holy holy holy
Holy is the Lamb
Holy holy holy holy
Holy is the Lamb"
