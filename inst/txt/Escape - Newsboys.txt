Don't believe the hype (hu-hu-hu-hu-hu)
(hu-hu-hu-hu-hu)

You're being tempted by the same ol', you say it's under control
Just remind me how you see so clearly face down in a hole
Press toward the light and the light will ground you
Go with the flow and the flow will drown you
Hey now, there's always an out?

But if you get up, get up, get up
You can breakaway (you gotta breakaway)
And if you get out, get out, get out (hu-hu-hu-hu-hu)
Nothing can overtake
Don't wait? escape
(hu-hu-hu-hu-hu)

We get beaten by the same sticks, until we start to crack
We get deceived by the same tricks
That's why the devil's bringing 'em back
(He's bringing 'em back)

But if you get up, get up, get up
You can breakaway (you gotta breakaway)
But if you get up, get up, get up
Nothing can overtake
Don't wait? escape
(hu-hu-hu-hu-hu)

Don't believe the hype
It's such a letdown
Don't believe the hype
It's such a letdown
Don't believe the hype
It's such a letdown
Don't believe the hype
It's such a letdown

But if you get up, get up, get up
You can breakaway (you gotta breakaway)
But if you get up, get up, get up
Nothing can overtake
But if you get up, get up, get up
You can breakaway (you gotta breakaway)
But if you get up, get up, get up
Nothing can overtake
Don't wait? escape
(hu-hu-hu-hu-hu)
Escape
