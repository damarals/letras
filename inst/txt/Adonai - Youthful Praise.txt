Youthful Praise

I lift my voice
I lift my praise to you
I lift my hands
I lift my worship to you
I love you more than I can say
I love you more than I can say
Ever I will sing
Only you will I adore
Glorify my Lord
Only you will I serve
For the world will fade away
Still my song to you remains
Only you will I adore
Oh I love you always..."
