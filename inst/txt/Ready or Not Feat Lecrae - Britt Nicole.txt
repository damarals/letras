"1" "Ready or Not (Feat. Lecrae)
Britt Nicole

Uh, Britt, 'crae
Ready - or not!
Yeah!
Let's go!

I tried to cover my shine
I've tried stayin' in the lines
I, I, I don't wanna hide
No, not tonight
You, you, you want me to take my light, light
Fit it in your box, right
I want you to look me in the eye-eye-eye-eye

Ready or not
Here, here, here-here-here I come
I'm about to show you
Where the light comes from
Oh, oh, ready or not here-here I come
This is who I am
I won't hide it
Imma take it all over the world
To the young, to the old, every boy and girl
Ready or not here-here I come
Imma show the world where the love is

I'm not ever sellin' out
A love out loud is what it's all about
Givin' everything to see the lost get found
Yeah, it's goin' down
You, you, you want me to take my light, light
Fit it in your box, right
I want you to look me in the eye-eye-eye-eye

I, I refuse to keep this buried deep inside of me
Yeah, this lil' light of mine, it's time to let it shine a bit
'Cause there's no point in hidin' it
It's everything I am
The source of all my hope
And it's the reason why I stand
And-and-and-and I pledge allegiance to being somebody real
There's no more holding it back
I'm showin' 'em how I feel, 'cuz love is more than a word
It's a noun and a verb, and hidin' it is absurd
Ya heard
Ready or not"
