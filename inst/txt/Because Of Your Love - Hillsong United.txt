Hillsong United

Verse:
Because of your Love,
ev'rythings changed
because of Your Love
I'll never be the same
Your Love is perfect and I'll never be afraid
Because of your love
ev'rything changed


Chorus:
I have this confidence that God is on my side
All of my days are in your hands
Love so amazing that it cannot be denied
that ev'ry day I'm in your plan
