Where you go I go
What you say I say, God
What you pray I pray
What you pray I pray

Where you go I go
What you say I say, God
What you pray I pray

Verse
Jesus only did
What he saw you do
He would only say
What he heard you speak

He would only move
When he felt you lead
Following your heart
Following your spirit

How could I expect
To walk without you
When every move that Jesus made
Was in surrender

I would not begin
To live without you
For you alone are worthy
And you are always good

You are always good
Yeah

You are always good
Always good
Always good
Yeah, yeah yeah

Chorus
Where you go I go
What you say I say, god
What you pray I pray

Though the world sees and soon forgets
We will not forget who you are
and what you've done for us
What you've done for us

Chorus
Where you go I go
What you say I say, God
What you pray I pray
What you pray I pray

Bridge
Though the world sees and soon forgets
We will not forget who you are
and what you've done for us

Bridge 2
Though the world sees and soon forgets
We will not forget, who you are
Who you are, who you are, yeah
Who you are, oh you are my God, you are my God
You are my God, you are my God, you are my God
Woah, yeah"
