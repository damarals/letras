"1" "Open Arms
Michael W. Smith

Many people
In the steeple
But no one leaves the walls

Quick to stand and speak
All of their beliefs
Quick to leave you if you fall

Tell me, where's the love
That knows no boundaries
Tell me, where's the love
Open arms
We need to be
Open arms

Never judging
Always loving
Needs to be what we become

Lifting up the lost
Showing them the cross
Shining brightly like the sun"
