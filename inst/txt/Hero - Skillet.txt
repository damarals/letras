I'm just a step away
I'm a just a breath away
Losin my faith today
Jen: Fallin off the edge today

I am just a man
Not superhuman
Jen: I'm not superhuman.
Someone save me from the hate

It's just another war
Just another family torn
Jen: Falling from my faith today
Just a step from the edge
Just another day in the world we live

I need a hero to save me now
I need a hero
Jen: Save me now
I need a hero to save my life
A hero'll save me
Jen: Just in time

I've gotta fight today
To live another day
Speakin my mind today
Jen: My voice will be heard today

I've gotta make a stand
But I am just a man
Jen: I'm not superhuman.
My voice will be heard today

It's just another war
Just another family torn
Jen: My voice will be heard today
It's just another kill
The countdown begins to destroy ourselves

I need a hero to save me now
I need a hero
Jen: Save me now
I need a hero to save my life
A hero'll save me
Jen: Just in time

I need a hero to save my life
I need a hero
Just in time.

Save me just in time
Save me just in time

Who's gonna fight for what's right
Who's gonna help us survive
We're in the fight of our lives
Jen: And we're not ready to die

Who's gonna fight for the weak
Who's gonna make 'em believe
I've got a hero
Jen: I've got a hero

Livin in me

I'm gonna fight for whats right
Today I'm speaking my mind
And if it kills me tonight
Jen: I will be ready to die

A hero's not afraid to give his life
A hero's gonna save me just in time

I need a hero to save me now
I need a hero
Jen: Save me now
I need a hero to save my life
A hero'll save me
Jen: Just in time.

I need a hero
Who's gonna fight for what's right
Who's gonna help us survive

I need a hero
Who's gonna fight for the weak
Who's gonna make 'em believe

I need a hero

I need a hero

A Hero's gonna save me just in time!"
