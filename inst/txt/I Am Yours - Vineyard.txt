"1" "I Am Yours
Vineyard

Father here i am in this place again
I know that you're no stranger to pain, to loneliness

Father here i come, lay my burdens down
Knowing that you'll take me as i am
So i come with freedom as your child and i run to your arms

My heart is a aching for my father, my eyes they long to see my god
This world has nothing i desire, your are what i'm looking for
Hide me underneath your shelter, cover me and i will say
I am your, surely i am your"
