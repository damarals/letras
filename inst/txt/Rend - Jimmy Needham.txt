Jimmy Needham

You've been tarnished
And you've been stained
And all the varnish you've used to cover up with is peeling away

Yet even now, return to me with nothing less
Than your wounded, broken heart
And cling to Me, your gracious King
Be shattered glass of empty jars and rend
Rend, rend, rend
Rend your hearts

You've been tarnished
And you've been stained
And all the varnish you've used to cover up with is peeling away

Yet even now, return to me with nothing less
Than your wounded, broken heart
And cling to Me, your gracious King
Be shattered glass of empty jars and rend
Rend, rend, rend
Rend your hearts

I don't need a grand display
Show me that your heart has changed
I don't need a show
Only just to know your own heart breaks

Yet even now, return to me with nothing less
Than your wounded, broken heart
And cling to Me, your gracious King
Be shattered glass of empty jars and rend
Rend, rend, rend
Rend your hearts"
