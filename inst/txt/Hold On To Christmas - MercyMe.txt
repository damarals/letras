"1" "Hold On To Christmas
MercyMe

Light the fire and trim the tree
It wont be long til Christmas Eve
So close your eyes and make believe
That dreams really do come true
Manger scenes and mistletoe
Christmas cards from friends we know
Theyll disappear like melted snow
At least for another year
channel
Watching children as they play
Makes you wish that Christmas would stay
chorus
All year long just for
Dreamers like me
And those who believe
The joy of the season would stay
All year long like a December snow
That just wont let go
Lets hold on to Christmas this year
Long ago and far away
Love was born on Christmas day
A cattle stall, a bed of hay
A star shining in the sky
channel
Even as the shepherds prayed
Heaven knew that Christmas would stay
chorus
All year long like a December snow
That just wont let go
Lets hold on to Christmas this year"
