"1" "You Are The One
Chris Dur√°n

You're the son of David
Your name is Eloim
God Emanuel and forever ever reings

As long as I shall live
The world will hear your voice
Tell about your love
Pouring mercy over me

When I'm alone I think of you
Early in a morning I think of you
I'll never stop my dancing
And worship before my king
All that I want is your presence

You are the one, adorable one
Burning desire within my heart
More than emotion, unquenchable love
Poured out and spread all
Over the nation"
