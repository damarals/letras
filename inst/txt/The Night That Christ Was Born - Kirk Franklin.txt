"1" "The Night That Christ Was Born
Kirk Franklin

[Chorus:]
Listen to the angels
Rejoicing e'er so sweetly
Receiving heaven's glory
The night that Christ was born
[repeat]

[Chorus II]
Can't you see the people
Coming from every nation
Pleading for salvation
The night that Christ was born

[Repeat Chorus I & II]

[Chorus III]
Oh such a wonderful savior
To be born in a manager
So that I can share His favor
And my heart be made anew

[Chorus IV]
Listen to the trumpets
Shouting through the darkness
Crying 'holy, holy'
The night that Christ was born

[Repeat Chorus III and IV]

[Repeat Chorus III]

Listen to the trumpets
Shouting through the darkness
Crying 'holy, holy' (Now Behold the Savior)
The night that Christ was born
[repeat Chorus]
