Title: They Need to Know
Autor: Kirk Franklin
Album: Christmas

They`ve taken Christ from christmas
Filled it with earthly joys
Like frosty and rudolph
Even a drummer boy
They need to know that Christ is christmas
They need to know that Christ is christmas
Sent down to save the world from sin
That`s why he came my friend
They really need to know

They`ve taken Christ from christmas
Replaced him with toys and games
The world really needs to know
That`s not why he came
They need to know that Christ is christmas
They need to know that Christ is christmas
Sent down to save the world from sin
That`s why he came my friend
They really need to know

They need to know he came to save the world
Sent down to save every precious boy and girl
Sent down to save the world from sin
That`s why he came my friend
They really need to know"
