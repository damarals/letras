"1" "Never Too Far Away
Newsboys

I want you to know
Somebody loves you (You)
Your hearts growin' cold (Cold)
When loves right beside you (You)

From your best moments to your darkest hours
You're held inside the hands of supernatural power
Don't you ever forget you are a child of God

And you're never too far away
To turn it all back around
You're more than your yesterdays
You can leave 'em all behind you now
You're never too far away
Oh, you gotta keep the faith
When everything falls apart
You're still in the arms of amazin' grace
You're nеver too far away

It's hard to believе (Believe)
That you are forgiven (—given)
Free from mistakes that built the walls
In your heart like a prison

From your best moments to your darkest hours
You're held inside the hands of supernatural power (Supernatural power)
Don't you ever forget you are a child of God (You are)

And you're never too far away
To turn it all back around
You're more than your yesterdays (Yesterdays)
You can leave 'em all behind you now
You're never too far away (Too far away)
Oh, you gotta keep the faith
When everything falls apart
You're still in the arms of amazin' grace
You're never too far away

Greater is He that is within you
Even greater than He that is in the world
He'll never leave, no, He'll never forsake you
The highs and the lows, wherever you go
I want you to know

You're never too far away
To turn it all back around
You're more than your yesterdays (Yesterdays)
You can leave 'em all behind you now (Leave 'em all behind you)
No, you're never too far away (Too far away)
Oh, you gotta keep the faith (Just keep the faith)
When everything falls apart
You're still in the arms of amazin' grace
You're never too far away

Hallelujah, I'm forgiven, you're forgiven
You're never too far away
Hallelujah, I'm forgiven, you're forgiven
You're never too far away
Hallelujah, I'm forgiven, you're forgiven
You're never too far away
Hallelujah, I'm forgiven, you're forgiven
We're never too far away"
