Since God will be my Shepherd
Oh, I won't need a thing
He leads the way before me
Restores my soul to sing
You lift my head from sorrow
And turn my mourning into joy

So I won't fear what evil brings
For You are with me
And You lay my anxious heart to rest
When I am with You

Oh, even through the valley
Oh, You are holding me
Your beauty is overflowing
Your face is all I see
You lift my head from sorrow
And turn my mourning into joy

I am home in the house of God
Yes, I'm home"
