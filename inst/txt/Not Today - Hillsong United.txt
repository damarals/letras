"1" "Not Today
Hillsong United

Trouble won't throw me
Won't break me
Won't scare me
No more
Fear must have thought I was faithless
When it came for my heart

'Cause I got a song that will never die
I know Your love is the reason why

I'll sing the night into the morning
I'll sing the fear into Your praise
I'll sing my soul into Your presence
Whenever I say Your Name
Let the devil know not today

Tell me did the enemy panic
As You took up that cross
Tell me did the darkness cry mercy
As You rolled back that rock

'Cause I know Your life is the life in mine
I know Your love is the reason why

I'll sing the night into the morning
I'll sing the fear into Your praise
I'll sing my soul into Your presence
Whenever I say Your Name
Let the devil know not today
Whenever I say Your Name Jesus
Let the devil know not today
Not now not ever again

Your love stood down death
Crushed the devil's head
Fear is just a liar
Running out of breath
The fight beneath Your feet
I'm standing on Jesus' Name
So let the devil know not today
Let the devil know not today No no
Not now not ever again Jesus
Let the devil know not today"
