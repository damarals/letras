"1" "The Fallout
Fireflight

Rushing out the house while it's burning down
Running through the door trying to make it out
Ashes fill the sky, you're left chose inside
Leaving everything that you know behind
See you fall apart right before your eyes
Tears run down your face, everything's erased

Oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Black heart beat
This is the fallout, this is the breakdown
What are you fighting for?
Give all that you've, got down to the last drop
What are you fighting for?
Standing in the fallout

Picking up the pieces with broken hands
Put it back together, however, you can
Left you high and dry, you're done asking why
Never going back to what used to be
Never gonna repeat that history
Lay it all to rest
Get it off of your chest"
