"x"
"1" "Slip Away
Elaine Martins

Everytime you look at me
A part of me comes alive
I went dead inside for so long and
I was going to lose my mind

I never though I will come to this
A feeling as good as this
And even though we fight
I know we will always make things right

Don't slip away don't slip away
Don't slip away
Don't slip away don't slip away
Don't slip away

I know it's hard to understand a girl like me
But for you its easy
And you let me be
Up and down we go

Boy I can't let you go
And those memories at most
And these enemies but
We get it together

That's why we together
Me and you is forever
Letting you go I will never
I will never

Every time you look at me
A part of me comes alive
I went dead inside for so long and
I was going to lose my mind

I never though I will come to this
A feeling as good as this
And even though we fight
I know we will always make things right

Don't slip away don't slip away
Don't slip away
Don't slip away don't slip away
Don't slip away

Don't slip away don't slip away
Don't slip away
Don't slip away don't slip away
Don't slip away"
