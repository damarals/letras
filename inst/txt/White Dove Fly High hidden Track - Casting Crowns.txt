Casting Crowns

Pu li leun haneul ga eh
Hee mang eh nale pyuhgo
Han up she jayoo lo ee
Choom choo myu nali nae

Bee dul gee ya!
Bee dul gee ya!
duh no pee nal ah la

Nae jo gook ee po leun ha naneul
Gooleumee heuleejee ahngeh


High up in the blue sky
Wings of hope are spreading wide
A white dove is dancing
Flying free and happily

White dove,
White dove,
Flying higher and higher

Lest my country's clean and blue skies
Should be cloudy and grey."
