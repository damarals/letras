Welcome to the freak show
Step up, status quo
Hope you enjoyed the ride
Welcome to the freak show
We got horns and halos
We ain't afraid and ain't buying a lie

Eat it, drink it, think it, be it, breathe it
Guess you don't even know who I am
I don' t believe it,
Need it, see it,
Be it, breed it
Time to make my final stand

Welcome to the freak show
This is where the freaks go
This is the place that they can never take away
Welcome to the freak show
We don't ever need though
One to tell us who to be, how to feed
I don't care what they believe
Welcome to the freak show

Welcome to the outcast
Take a step across the tracks
We ain't got nothing to prove
Don't need your smiling face
Don't need your handshake
Because this is my life to live and I ain't living for you

Eat it, drink it, think it, be it, breathe it
Guess you don't even know who I am
I don' t believe it,
Need it, see it,
Be it, breed it
Time to make my final stand

Welcome to the freak show
This is where the freaks go
This is the place that they can never take away
Welcome to the freak show
We don't ever need though
One to tell us who to be, how to think
I don't care what they believe
Welcome to the freak show

I'm a freak naturally
Just how I want to be
You're a freak just like me
I'm a freak naturally
Just how I want to be
You're a freak just like me

Welcome to the freak show
This is where the freaks go
This is the place that they can never take away
Welcome to the freak show
We don't ever need though
One to tell us who to be, how to think
I don't care what they believe

Freak show, freak show
The place that they can never take away
Freak show, freak show
The place that they can never take away

Welcome to the freak show
