Hillsong United

(Verse 1)
You are my light, You are my strength
You are my rock, On You I stand

(Verse 2)
I lift my voise, I raise my hands
I lift my soul, with all I am

(Pre-Chorus)
In Christ forever I stand

(Chorus)
I will believe
You are strong enough in my weakness
God be lifted up and I will sing
Lift Your praises high, Lord be magnified
You make all things new
I will believe

(Verse 3)
So hear this song, receive our praise
You are our strength for all our days

(Bridge)
We Lift You up, our voices high
In every storm let God arise"
