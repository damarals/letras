"1" "Take Me Over
Red

Traces of your voice
I know it, I know it so well
Waking in the storm
I can feel you, I can feel you with me
Can I go again
Oh your reckless, your reckless love goes
I cannot defend, this untamed heart is waiting


I am standing on the edge
Take me over, take me over
See how fast this life can change
Take me further, lead me further

Take me over, take me over

Find my life ahead
Oh I don't know, I don't know where
But I'm starting on my way
Will you meet me, will you meet me there
Echoes in the night
Like a melody is haunting me
But then I meet your eyes
With the fire of a rising sun

I am standing on the edge
Take me over, take me over
See how fast this life can change
Take me further, lead me further

You believe a life can change?
Take me over, take me over
You believe a life can change?
Take me over, take me over
You believe a life can change?
Take me over, take me over
You believe a life can change?

I am standing on the edge
Take me over, take me over
See how fast this life can change
Take me further, lead me further
Take me over, take me over"
