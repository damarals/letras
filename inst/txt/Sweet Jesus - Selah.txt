Selah

Sweet Jesus, my Savior
You are my faithful Friend
You Made me, You know me
You've seen my every sin
And my soul is amazed
By this gift of Your grace
And these arms that take me in
Sweet Jesus, my Savior
You are my faithful Friend

Sweet Jesus, my Shelter
You are my faithful Friend
The Refuge that I run to
When my world comes closing in
Why should I be afraid
When I know I am saved
By the arms that take me in
Sweet Jesus, my Savior
You are my faithful Friend

Sweet Jesus, my Sheperd
You are my faithful Friend
You hold me, You lead me
I'll follow 'til the end
And once more I will say
On that beautiful day
When Your arms take me in
Sweet Jesus, my Savior
You are my faithful Friend

Sweet Jesus, my Savior
You are my faithful Friend"
