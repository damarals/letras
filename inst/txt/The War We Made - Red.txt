"1" "The War We Made
Red

You're a voice when the light is gone
Never know who's side it's on
Think you're gonna see someone
But you are the only one

Am I alone? Am I alright?
Am I insane? Am I alive?
What does it take to stop waging war with

All I thought I wanted
All I thought I needed?

Waking up from myself
To a life outside this hell
No more lies, no more pain
You can't fight the war we made

The war we made

You thought the worst was done
But it's there when the morning comes
You lie awake under the weight and the fear
Just let it go, it isn't real

All I thought I wanted
All I thought I needed

Waking up from myself
To a life outside this hell
No more lies, no more pain
You can't fight the war we made

The war we made
The war we made
The war we made
The war we made

You're a voice when the light is gone
Never know who's side it's on
Think you're gonna see someone
But you're still the only one

Am I alone? Am I alright?
Am I insane? Am I alive?
What does it take to stop waging war with?
Am I alone? Am I alright?
Am I insane? Am I alive?
What does it take to?
What does it take to?

Waking up from myself
To a life outside this hell
No more lies, no more pain
You can't fight the war we made

The war we made
The war we made
The war we made
The war we made"
