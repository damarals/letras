"1" "The Breaker's Commission
For Today

Life
Love
Forgiveness
Acceptance
Stripping demons right off my back trying to leach life off me
Get off me and feel my father's fury and oppressor
One day you'll feel the full blast of his vengeance, bells above but for now I'll love
Cause I got strength ,He blew courage in my backbone
Now I'll stand straight and militant lining up in Jehovahâ€™s battalion
Knowing you can't challenge him so we march forward
Swift as eagles, set like talons ready to grip souls from your grass
Slick snake in a crass my Lord sees you and vengeance is his
But for now I retaliate, propelled by a holy man made to heal cause I know how bad it hurts
Full of madness at first but now gladness bursts out the seams of our beings cause we overflow with the oil of joy
the ointment of the anointed mending any torn soul healing any broken bone
He is here
He was there
He is peace
He is faith."
