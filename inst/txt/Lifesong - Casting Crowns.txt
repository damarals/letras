"1" "Lifesong
Casting Crowns

Empty hands held high
Such small sacrifice
If not joined with my life
I sing in vain tonight

May the words I say
And the things I do
Make my lifesong sing
Bring a smile to You

CHORUS
Let my lifesong sing to You
Let my lifesong sing to You
I wanna sign Your name at the end of this day
Knowing that my heart was true
Let my lifesong sing to You

Lord I give my life
A living sacrifice
To reach a world in need
To be Your hands and feet

So may the words I say
And the things I do
Make my lifesong sing
Bring a smile to You

CHORUS

Hallelujah, Hallelujah Let my lifesong sing to You (3x)

CHORUS 2x"
