They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique
and swinging hot spot
Don't it always seem to go
but you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot

They took all the trees
And put them in a tree museum
And they charged all the people
25 bucks just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
They paved paradise
put up a parking lot

Hey farmer farmer
Put away your D.D.T. now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees
Please!
Dont it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
They paved paradise
When you put up a parking lot
I said you pave paradise
When you put up a parking lot

Dont it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
pave paradise
When you put up a parking lot

Late last night
I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi
carried off my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
pave paradise
When you put up a parking lot

Dont it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
They pave paradise
put up a parking lot

Oh na now then a pave paradise
put up a parking lot
Hey steam rolled paradise
you put a parking lot
