"1" "Fall Into You
Vineyard

How can it be that I'm before You now
How can it be that I'm still standing while You're here
Take me away to the place where I'm with You
To fall in Your arms and empty myself
And worship at Your feet

And I'm amazed by the sight
Of this breathtaking light
That shines from Your eyes
Lover of my soul
Let me fall into You let me be consumed
All I want is You Lover of my soul

How can it be that I'm not broken every time
How can it be that I'm still not satisifed
Take me away to the place where I'm with You
To fall in Your arms and empty myself
And worship at Your feet"
