"1" "We Are Alive
Fireflight

Standing here under heaven's light
I do believe
I take hold of this precious time
Given to me
Catch the moment and take it in
This is the dream
You and I we were born for this
Here now we're free

Ch
We're feeling good tonight
Can't keep it all inside
We are alive
We're shining like the stars
Just being who we are
We are alive

Share the love, give all that you can
Your heart is full
Let it rain like a waterfall
Unstoppable


Nothing can stop us now
Nothing can slow us down
We're feeling so alive"
