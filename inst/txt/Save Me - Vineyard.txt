"1" "Save Me
Vineyard

Then my first thought would be of You
With my last breath I'd call to You
Only You and You alone possess the words of life
Where else can I go
Save me save me

If a famine came into my land of plenty
The singing nightingale was stormed by birds of prey
If a fire broke out and ravaged every sentry
And my walls of stone became like burning hay

If a flood came in and made my pool an ocean
Humble streets of clay became like diamond beds
If the winds of change brought manna down
From heaven and all my priceless pearls
Should hang on golden threads

(BRIDGE)
Save me save me
Grant that I may have enough
That I don't have to beg
Grant that I don't get so much
That I forget Your grace
Save me save me"
