"1" "Who To Listen To
Amy Grant

Don't take a ride from a stranger,
No way to know where they go.
You may be left on a long dark road,
Lost and alone.
Don't you recall what your Mama told?
You've got to learn hot from cold.
When you're afraid that you might get burned,
Where do you turn?

You've got to know who to, (who to)
Who not to listen to.
You've gotta know who to, (ooooh....)
Who not to listen to.
Well, you know, they're gonna hit you from all sides,
Better make up your mind
Who to, who not to listen to.

(Who to listen to.)

How can you learn what is true and just?
How to know who to trust?
Here comes a man with a scam to sell.
How can you tell?
You've gotta know there's a bigger plan,
Room to fall, room to stand.
Pray for the plan to begin in you;
Keep your heart true.

You've got to know who to, (who to)
Who not to listen to.
You've gotta know who to,
Who not to listen to. (Who to listen to.)
Well, you know, they're gonna hit you from all sides,
Better make up your mind
Who to, who not to listen to.

It's gonna hit you from all sides,
Better make up your mind
Who to, (who to), who not to listen to.

Everyone will have their words to say....
Find the word to help you find your way....

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...yeah...ah....)

You've got to know who to, (who to)
Who not to listen to.
You've gotta know who to,
Who not to listen to. (Who to listen to.)
Well, you know, they're gonna hit you from all sides,
Better make up your mind
Who to, who not to listen to.

They're gonna hit you from all sides,
Better make up your mind
Who to, who not to listen to. (Who to listen to.)

They're gonna hit you from all sides.

Hit you from all sides,
Better make up your mind
Who to, (who to), who not to listen to.
(Who do you listen to?)

They're gonna hit you from all sides, (They're gonna hit!)
They're gonna hit you from all sides,
Better make up your mind
Who to, who not to listen to.

(Who to listen to.)

(You've got to know.
Who to listen to.)

(You gotta know who to.
Who to listen to.)

(They're gonna hit you from all sides.
Hit you from all sides.)
