"x"
"1" "Goodbye Ordinary
MercyMe

I wonder when we first bought into this
So satisfied with status quo
Have we convinced ourselves that this is all there is

Well all that is within me
Says we were meant to break free

Chorus
Live like thereâ€™s no tomorrow
Love extravagantly
Lead a life to be followed
Goodbye Ordinary
Goodbye Ordinary

We were never meant to compromise
Settle for mediocrity
This life was never made to be a waste of time

Well all that is within me
Says no more just existing

Chorus

Bridge
No more complacency
No more just settling
This time
Goodbye to atrophy
For we were meant to be
Alive

Chorus"
