As soon as I open up my eyes
It's the same voice on the inside
Already (Already) so heavy (Heavy)
Weighin' on my soul

All the fear all the worry (All the worry)
All the heart ache all the hurting (All the hurting)
Collidin' with Your light and
Tryna steal my hope

Some days I break
I lose my way
More doubt than faith

But every time I'm in that fight
Your love keeps pullin' me back, pullin' me back
It's magnetic (Magnetic)
I've pushed away but I can't escape
Your love keeps pullin' me back, pullin' mе back
It's magnetic (Magnetic)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's magnetic (Magnеtic)

Your goodness won't give up on me
It's a fountain flowin' so deep
You're so patient and so gracious
It's unconditional

Even when I try to go my own way
Even when my heart is in the wrong place
You bring it back around like a boomerang
Just like a boomerang

'Cause every time I'm in that fight
Your love keeps pullin' me back, pullin' me back
It's magnetic (Magnetic)
I've pushed away but I can't escape
Your love keeps pullin' me back, pullin' me back
It's magnetic (Magnetic)

Like gravity
Just when I think that I'm outta reach
Your love, Your mercy keep pullin' me, pullin' me
Oh, I can feel it, feel it, feel it
It's changin' me
No more searchin', it's clear to see
Everything that I used to be is history
Oh, I can feel it, feel it, feel it

Yeah, every time I'm in that fight
Your love keeps pullin' me back, pullin' me back
It's magnetic (Magnetic)
I've tried to push away but I can't escape
Your love keeps pullin' me back, pullin' me back
