"1" "Your Eyes
Oficina G3

I feel your eyes looking at my life
Where I go wherever I am
I listen your voice
It makes me happy and console
I feel the strenght of your love

Even the world makes me cry
I won't give up trust in you

Because you are and you'll always be
The Lord of my life

Ever and forever
The Lord of my life"
