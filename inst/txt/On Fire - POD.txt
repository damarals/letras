P.O.D.

Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire!
Come into my house and i'll set you on fire!
Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire! i'm on fire! i'm on fire!
Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire!
Drink from my cup as much as you require!
Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire!

I was born, raging against the machine before;
Rage against the machine, heretore;
More than meets the eye is the truth unseen;
The king salutes the recruits of the new regime;
Storm the highways and byways, bring down the walls;
Because i will not sleep until babylon falls;
To coexist with the system is a mission to deceive us;
So i & i must walk alone through these flames of hell.

Turn the heat up!

Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire!
Come into my house and i'll set you on fire!
Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire! i'm on fire! i'm on fire!
Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire!
Drink from my cup as much as you require!
Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire!

Ther's a sucka born every minute sucking everybody's gimmick;
Remember when you said
That would never be you and now you're living it;
Everyday routine, destiny foreseen;
That's why i stand for the cause, you jump from scene to scene;
Let the brethren avow that they wont sell out;
Cause no longer are we blind, we see clearly now;
And because i sin i hope that god forgives;
And because i'm dead, it's the only way to live.
(and it's the only way to die)

Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire!
Come into my house and i'll set you on fire!
Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire! i'm on fire! i'm on fire!
Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire!
Drink from my cup as much as you require!
Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire!

Turn the heat up!
My soul ignites!
Consumed by the fire, let us burn tonight;
Let us burn tonight!
Turn the heat up and burn tonight!
Forever we burn tonight!

Turn the heat up!

Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire!
Come into my house and i'll set you on fire!
Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire! i'm on fire! i'm on fire!
Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire!
Drink from my cup as much as you require!
Stop, drop, roll, i'm on fire!"
