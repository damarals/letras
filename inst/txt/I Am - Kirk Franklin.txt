"x"
"1" "I Am
Kirk Franklin

How do you do
I am a sinner
Born into sin and shaped in iniquity
Now I believe not who I was but still not what I shall be
You found me and gave me your name and
Things I desired have changed but
Inside you'll see it's still broken pieces
Deep in me reaches for you
How do you do
I am a beggar
Desperate for more
I hunger for your truth
See I am shattered
Though I may fall still you make all things new
You speak, the storm, it obeys and ..
There is no way to mistake
Though I still feel you continue to heal, look close and see, whoa

Chorus


I am so far from perfect
I thought life is worthless
Until you showed me who I am
Not here by mistake

No luck only grace
I'm on my way to
Who I am
I am (repeats 3x)
Thank God I am
I am, I am

How do you do?
I am a winner
I lost a few and life struck me to my knees
And now I am standing
Not by my power, but your life inside of me
Even through seasons and changes
No tear has ever been wasted
This under system it worked for my good look now and see
I am not the old me but still

Chorus

I am"
