"1" "Your Name Is Glorious
Jesus Culture

Who is like you
Took the sin of the world
On your shoulders
You did it so willingly

God the price you paid
Will forever be enough
And the life you gave
Yeah, you gave it all
For love

Your name is glorious
We lift you up higher, higher
Come see what God has done
We lift him up higher, higher

Who can fathom
The depths of the seas
And the universe
How far does it reach

Still you spread your arms out
Upon the cross for us
And the life you gave
Yeah, you gave it all
For love

Your name is glorious
We lift you up higher, higher
Come see what God has done
We lift him up higher, higher

We will sing
Over again
We will bring
The highest praise
To the king
Sing it again
Sing it again

Your name is glorious
We lift you up higher, higher
Come see what God has done
We lift him up higher, higher

We will sing
Over again
We will bring
The highest praise
To the king
Sing it again
Sing it again

Your name is glorious
We lift you up higher, higher
Come see what God has done
We lift him up higher, higher"
