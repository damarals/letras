Third Day

Magnificent holy father
I stand in awe of all I see
Of all the things you have created
But still you choose to think of me

And who am I that you should suffer
Your very life to set me free?
The only thing that I can give you
Is the life you gave to me

This is my offering, dear Lord
This is my offering to you, God
And I will give you my life
For it's all I have to give
Because you gave your life for me

I stand before you at this altar
So many have given you more
I may not have much I can offer
Yet what I have is truly yours


This is my offering, dear Lord
This is my offering to you, God
And I will give you my life
For it's all I have to give
Because you gave your life for me

This is my offering
This is my offering, dear Lord
This is my offering to you, God
And I will give you my life
For it's all I have to give
Because you gave your life for me

This is my offering to you, God.
And I will give you my life
For it's all I have to give
Because you gave your life for me

Because you gave your life for me"
