"1" "It Would Take All Day
Kirk Franklin

It would take all day
To tell you
How I need you
It was hard but now I'm learning how to trust you
And to know you
More than just my friend
Cause friendships sometimes end

It would take all day
To show you
How I miss you
When my own desires they steal my heart from you
And hurt you
But still you say there's room
That you want me close to you
It's amazing

So incredible to me
How you look past where I am
And see where I will be
Though millions call your name
You still make time for me
That's incredible to me
That's incredible to me

It would take all day
To tell you
How I thank you
For all those times in my life you've come through
I appreciate you
No goodness of my own
How you forget my wrong
It's amazing

So incredible to me
How you look past where I am

And see where I will be
Though millions call your name
You still make time for me
That's incredible to me

So incredible to me
How birds that fly will testify
You will supply their needs
Although my life may change
Your promises you keep
That's incredible to me
To me (2x)

If it takes all day
To tell you
I love you
This heart that beats each fragile piece I give you
It's for you
Before I knew my name
My love was pre-arranged
It's amazing

So incredible to me
How you look past where I am
And see where I will be
Though millions call your name
You still make time for me
That's incredible to me

So incredible to me
How birds that fly will testify
You will supply their needs
Although my life may change
Your promises you keep
That's incredible to me (2x)"
