What can wash away my sins
(There's) Nothing but the blood of Jesus

What can make me whole again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

This is all my righteousness
It's nothing but the blood of Jesus

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
