"1" "Lay Me Down
Aline Barros

With this heart open wide
From the depths from the heights
I will bring a sacrifice
With these hands lifted high
Hear my song, hear my cry
I will bring a sacrifice
I will bring a sacrifice

With this heart open wide
From the depths from the heights
I will bring a sacrifice
With these hands lifted high
Hear my song, hear my cry
I will bring a sacrifice
I will bring a sacrifice

I lay me down, I'm not my own
I belong to you alone
Lay me down, lay me down
Hand on my heart this much is true
There's no life apart from you
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, yeah

Letting go of my pride
Giving up all my rights
Take this life and let it shine
Take this life and let it shine

I lay me down, I'm not my own
I belong to you alone
Lay me down, lay me down
Hand on my heart this much is true
There's no life apart from you
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down

It will be my joy to say, Your will, Your way
It will be my joy to say, Your will, Your way
It will be my joy to say, Your will, Your way always

It will be my joy to say, Your will, Your way
It will be my joy to say, Your will, Your way
It will be my joy to say, Your will, Your way always
Always, always

I lay me down, I'm not my own
I belong to you alone
Lay me down, lay me down
Hand on my heart this much is true
There's no life apart from you
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down"
