"1" "Love Is A Miracle
Delirious

Love, pulled me up off my knees,
Took all my disease,
You’ve always been there for me.

Love put shoes on my feet,
Took a song made it sweet,
You always had ears for me.

You’ve given me everything,
Love of my life
Forever I’ll sing that

Love is a Miracle oh, oh,
Love is a Miracle,
Your mercy catches me when I fall,
Love is such a miracle.

Love is where you abide,
It sees every side,
It crosses the great divide.

Love took hold of my hand
And taught me to walk
It’s time now to make a stand."
