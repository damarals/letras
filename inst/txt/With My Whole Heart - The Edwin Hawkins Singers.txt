"1" "With My Whole Heart
The Edwin Hawkins Singers

Verse:
There's so much in my heart
that I wanna say dear Lord.
There's so much You are
and so much You've done.

I wanna get some help from You, Lord,
in my heart I wanna to try to relate it tonight,
and please forgive me Lord if I start to cry.

Chorus:
(I've got to) tell You how I love You, Jesus,
tell You how I worship and adore You, Master.
Teach me how to honor Thee,
with my whole heart,
I will bless You, Precious Lord.

Bridge:
There's no trouble You can't see me through,
never a worry, never a care, always on time.
When I'm alone, You raise my spirit by Your touch,
You made my day bright,

Oh with my whole heart,
I will bless You, Precious Lord.

Ending:
With my whole heart,
I will bless You, Precious Lord."
