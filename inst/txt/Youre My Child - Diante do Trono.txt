"1" "You're My Child
Diante do Trono

My child I am here
Longing for the moment
When you’re back with me
I want to hold you near
My child, come and see
I am waiting for you
With my arms open wide
Come running, come to me

Cry out for me
I’ll hear your call
Seek me and I will be found
I will never let you down
Draw near to me
I will take you in my arms
I’ll give you new life
I will keep you by my side
You’re my child

Let me hold you
Let me hug you
Let me squeeze you
Let me caress
How I love you"
