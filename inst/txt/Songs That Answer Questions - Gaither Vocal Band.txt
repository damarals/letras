"1" "Songs That Answer Questions
Gaither Vocal Band

I don't wanna spend my time a-writing songs that answer questions
That nobody's even asking anyhow
When the house is burning to the ground
There's just no time to stand around
Arranging all the pictures on the wall
I wanna spend my life a-giving folks the living water
And the bread of life they just can't live without
Instead of spending all that time a-writing songs that answer questions
That nobody's even asking anyhow

Don't wanna spend my life a preaching sermons that give answers
To the questions no one's asking anywhere
When there's so much pain and hurting there's no time to be searching
For the needles in the haystacks that aren't there
I wanna spend my time a-wearing myself out for Jesus
With the news a cure's been found to heal our land
Instead of making lists, inventing creeds that aren't concerned with people's needs
I'll show 'em how to touch the nail scarred hand

I don't wanna spend my time praying prayers bombarding heaven
With requests to reign down fire on saints who care
In our methods we may differ, but if christ the lord we live for
May we not forget the enemy is out there
I wanna spend my life making my part of the body
Of the savior work with smooth efficiencey
One may be the knee, and one the toes, I'm the chin and I'm the nose
But listen, brother, we have need of these

I don't wanna spend my time a-writing songs that answer questions
That nobody's even asking anyhow
When the house is burning to the ground
There's just no time to stand around
Arranging all the pictures on the wall
I wanna spend my life a-giving folks the living water
And the bread of life they just can't live without
Instead of spending all that time a-writing songs that answer questions
That nobody's even asking anyhow"
