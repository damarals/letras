"1" "With All Of Your Heart
Diante do Trono

I want to know you my lord
Come and touch me
With your presence
All I need is more of you in me
I know there's so much more
Of your great love
Of your life and power
Let me hear your heart beat

Teach me the way
I want to find you
Show me your face
I canâ€™t live without you

You will seek me
And you will find me
When you search for me
With all of your heart"
