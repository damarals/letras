"1" "Human Spark
Michael W. Smith

God, for the life of me
I don’t know why
We hurt each other
In the name of what is right
Oh what we day think is right

God, for the life of me
I don’t understand
Echos every day of man’s
Inhumanity to man
Man’s inhumanity to man

There’s a river of sorrow
Running thru my heart
Thru the long night I will follow
The glimmer in the dark
Lord, You are the human spark

God, for the life of me
I cannot explain
How people born of love
Lose there way to hate
Oh there’s got to be a better way"
