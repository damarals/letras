Switchfoot

Face down with the LA curbside ending
In ones and zeros.
Downtown was the perfect place to hide.
The first star that I saw last night was a headlight
of a man-made sky, but
Man-made never made our dreams collide.

(chorus)
Here we are now with the falling sky and the rain,
We're awakening
Here we are now with the desperate youth and the pain,
We're awakening
Maybe it's called ambition, you've been talking in your sleep
About a dream, We're awakening

Last week found me living for nothing but deadlines,
With my dead beat sky but, this town doesn't look the same tonight
These dreams started singing to me out of nowhere
And in all my life I don't know if I've ever felt so alive, alive

(chorus)

I want to wake up kicking and screaming
I want to wake up kicking and screaming
I want a heart that I know is beating,
It's beating, I'm bleeding.
I want to wake up kicking and screaming
I want to live like I know what I'm leaving
I want a heart that I know is beating,
It's beating, I'm bleeding"
