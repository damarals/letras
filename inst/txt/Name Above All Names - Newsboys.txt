"1" "Name Above All Names
Newsboys

Your Name is highly exalted
Jesus forever be glorified
Forever be glorified

Your Name is power to conquer
Your fame resounds throughout heaven and earth
Resounds throughout heaven and earth

Name above all names, You are glorious
Wonderful and true, powerful are You
There will be a day, when every knee will bow
Before Your Holiness, every tongue confess
The Name, the Name above all names

Rulers will one day be silent
Lost in the wonder and awe of Your Name
The wonder and awe of Your Name

Eternal none is Your equal
We cry no other God but You
No other God but You

Every knee will bow
Every knee must bow
Every knee must bow
To You"
