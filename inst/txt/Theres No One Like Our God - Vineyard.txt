"1" "There's No One Like Our God
Vineyard

There's no one like our God, no one at all
He gave His Son for us, Jesus the Lord
Who can love us like He does, no one at all
Oh how we love You Lord

You are high above all nations
Your glory shines above the heavens
Humbled Yourself to love and save us
Be praised through endless generations

You lift the needy from the ashes
And seat them high up with the princes
You give the barren woman healing
She'll dance with joy like the mother of children"
