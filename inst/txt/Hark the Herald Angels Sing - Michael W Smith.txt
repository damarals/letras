"1" "Hark the Herald Angels Sing
Michael W. Smith

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echo back their joyus strains

Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo (x4)

Come to Bethlehem and see
(Gloria O sing Gloria)
Him whose birth the angels sing
(Gloria O sing Gloria)
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn king

Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo (x4)

Angels we have heard on high
(Gloria O sing Gloria)
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
(Gloria O sing Gloria)
Jesus Lord of heav'n and earth
With us sing our Savior's birth

Gloria O Gloria in exelsis Deo (x8)

Alleluia

"
