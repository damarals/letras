Fireflight

The clock is ticking
The seconds pass you by as you lie frozen
You are petrified of one more failure
A swing and a miss might break your heart in half
Yeah I know you feel alone
Don't let it break your back

Don't lay down
Don't let it destroy you
Pain is real but it's not gonna own you
Not this time around
(this is your time now)
Get back up, gotta keep on trying
Raise your fist, gotta keep on fighting
This is your time now
This is your time now

Your head is spinning
The path is right before you but you're stopping
The cycle locks you in and you can't see
That you're so close to finally being free
Yeah I know, yes I know
That you can turn the key

Don't lay down
Don't let it destroy you
Pain is real but it's not gonna own you
Not this time around
(this is your time now)
Get back up, gotta keep on trying
Raise your fist, gotta keep on fighting
This is your time now
This is your time now

You're not hopeless, you're not worthless, no
You are loved, don't give up now
This is your time now

Don't lay down
Don't let it destroy you
Pain is real but it's not gonna own you
Not this time around
(this is your time now)
Get back up, gotta keep on trying
Raise your fist, gotta keep on fighting
This is your time now
This is your time now"
