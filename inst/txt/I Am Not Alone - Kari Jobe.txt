"1" "I Am Not Alone
Kari Jobe

(Verse 1)
When I walk through deep waters
I know that you will be with me
When I'm standing in the fire
I will not be overcome

Through the valley of the shadow
Oh I will not fear

(Chorus
I am not alone
I am not alone
You will go before me
You will never leave me

(Verse 2)
In the midst of deep sorrow
I see your light is breaking through
The dark of night will not over take me
I am pressing into you
Lord you fight my every battle
And I will not fear

(Bridge
You amaze me
You redeem me
You call me as your own

In my shame
You're my defender
You're my refuge in the storm

Through these trials
You have always been faithful
You bring healing to my soul"
