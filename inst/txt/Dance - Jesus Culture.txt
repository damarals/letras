I'm after your heart, why should I be still
When the worship starts Lord
I'm so in love with you
What can man do, can't hold me back anymore

You spin over me, and you are pleased when
I spend myself on you
I'm gonna let go now, really worship
Letting my dance come forth

Chorus:
Dance, dance
Let the Spirit move you
Dance, dance
Holy Spirit in you

Turned my morning into dancing
My heart is overjoyed
I will praise You
You healed my body and made me new
My heart is overjoyed
I will dance with You
Gave me love that broke down fear
My heart is overjoyed
I will sing to You
My heart is overjoyed
I will praise, I will dance, I will sing for you, for you!"
