"1" "Our God Is Love
Hillsong United

(Verse 1)
Every soul every beating heart
Every nation and every tongue
Come find hope in the love
Of the Father

All creation will
Bow as one
Lift their eyes
See the risen Son
Jesus Saviour
Forever and after

(Chorus)
This is love
Jesus came and died
And gave His life for us
Let our voices rise
And sing for all His done
Our sins is overcome

Our God is love
Our God is love

(Verse 2)
Every distant and broken heart
Every prayer every outstretched arm
Finding hope in the love of the Father
Age to age let His praises rise
All the glory for all of time
Jesus Saviour forever and after

(Bridge)
Age to age
We will be singing
In the light of all Hes done

All the earth
Everyone singing
In the wonder of His love"
