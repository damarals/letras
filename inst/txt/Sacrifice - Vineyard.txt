Vineyard

I will be a living sacrifice
Pure and holy in Your eyes
I will follow where you lead
I'm falling deeper into deep

I will hold to all that's true
And give it all to follow you
You give strength when I am weak
You are everything I need

Holy, holy, holy are you Lord
I'm set apart for the one that I adore
Holy, holy, holy are you Lord
You paid the price that I could not afford"
