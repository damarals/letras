"1" "The Tree Of The Cross
Shirley Carvalhaes

I wanted to know
About the lumberjack himself
What wood he used to make the cross
Although I feel that tree cried
When it fell on the ground
And the ax that plowed it
Blinded itself with so much emotion

The cross (the cross)
It was the heaviest
On the outside they only saw wood
But inside were my sins
On the outside they only saw wood
But inside were my sins

I wanted to know what the hangman felt
When Jesus struck with forty stripes
Making so many stings in him who did only good
Who knows, the hangman felt
The pain of lashes also

I wanted to know why earth trembled
The sun has gathered and night has come
If the crime was protested
In the author of creation
They showed more feelings
Proved to have more heart"
