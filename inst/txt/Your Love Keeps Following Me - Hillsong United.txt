"1" "Your Love Keeps Following Me
Hillsong United

You loved as you foun me
Your love Keeps following Me
You wrapped your arms around me
Yur love Keeps following Me
By grace i'm what I should be
Your love Keeps following Me
You saw as I could be
Your love Keeps following Me

And it's higher
Reaches from heaven to men
It's wider
Anyone can come in
It's deeper
It covers any sin
And I know this one thing
Wherever I go
I know
Your love Keeps following Me"
