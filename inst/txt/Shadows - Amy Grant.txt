Amy Grant

There are two of me
One does the right thing,
One cannot see.
Standing back to back,
Who is the strong one
In the last act?
Every path I take,
Roads I go down,
Choices I make,
Take me right between
Patches of light and
Darkness in me.

Oh, we have to keep
A watch on our shadows--
Every move
They secretly make.
We try to be
So close to heaven,
But then our shadows,
They run away.
They pull away.

Oh....

And the shadows prove,
Falling behind,
Tracing each move, oh,
When I do some wrong,
There is no hiding;
Shadows are long.

So we have to keep
A watch on our shadows--
Every move (Every move)
They secret make, yeah, yeah,
We try to be
So close to heaven, (Mmmm....)
But then our shadows,
Pull us away.
They pull away....

We have to keep
A watch on our shadows--
Every move (Ooooh....)
They secretly make, yeah,
We try to be
So close to heaven,
But then our shadows,
They pull us away.

Oh, we have to keep
A watch on our shadows--
Every move (oooh....) they secretly make, yeah,
We try to be
So close to heaven,
But then our shadows
Pull us away.
Pull us away.

Pull us away.

(Ha, hu ha, oh no, cha cha.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
Keepin' it under my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
On my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
Keepin' it under my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
Keepin' it under my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
Keepin' it under my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
On my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
Keepin' it under my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
Keepin' it under my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
Keepin' it under my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
On my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
Keepin' it under my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
Keepin' it under my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
Keepin' it under my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
On my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
Keepin' it under my shadow.
Oh no, gotta keep our watch.
Keepin' it under my shadow.)
