"1" "Thirst Is Taking Over
Skillet

CHORUS:
You alone are what my soul needs
You know the thirst is taking over
Hardly breathe, I'm in urgent need
You know the thirst is taking over

The thirst is taking over

Hold me down, hold me down
Drip it on my tongue
And my convulsions stop
Thirst for love, thirst for your love
I could swallow your beauty whole

CHORUS

Running out, times running out
Searching for the one who can conquer me
I'm going to scream aloud, throw it down
Crash in the sweet obsession of you
I'm going to swim and drown in the wake of you

CHORUS

The thirst is taking over
I wanna taste it
I need to taste it
Deep in the Saviors arms

CHORUS

I wanna drink you in
I am drinking you in
I wanna drink you in

Hardly breathe, I'm in urgent need
You know the thirst is taking over
The thirst is taking over

I wanna taste it
I need to taste it
Deep in the Saviors arms
