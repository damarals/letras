"1" "Jesus Loves Me
Gaither Vocal Band

Jesus loves me! This I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong,
They are weak but He is strong.

Chorus
Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me!
The Bible tells me so.

Jesus loves me! He who died,
Heaven's gate He is gonna open wide;
He will wash away my sin,
Let His little child come in.

Chorus

by Ste."
