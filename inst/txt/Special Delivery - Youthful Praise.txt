Youthful Praise

Chorus:
You've given your love to me
Special delivery
You've given your love to me
Special delivery
Repeat Chorus
When I was in a special need
You gave a special answer
Especially considering my plight
Discovering my broken heart
You did not leave me helpless
Quickly stealing me away from night
Now I am so happy
You did not let me down
You overcome my struggle with that game
Now I know the victory
In overcoming sin
Whenever I just call upon Your Name!
Repeat Chorus
When You were a special boy
A human on this earth
Tempted every way but without sin
Bearing all the sacrifice
And trouble that we'd given
In spite of this You gave us second birth
Now I am committed
To telling everyone
That You are not a myth, you are the LORD!
I'm encouraged every day
And daily I'm assured
To gaining strength from feasting on Your Word (yeah)
Repeat Chorus
Chorus 2:
Through trouble, danger, sword
I will trust in the Lord
You've given me all I need
I call You desperately
You answer graciously
You've given Your love to me
Stepout:
Special delivery and your home above
Given your love to me
Desperately I call oh yes
Given your love to me
You've given your love, given your love
Given your love to me
You've given me all I need
By giving your love to me
We'll you've given your love to me
You've given your love, given your love
Special delivery"
