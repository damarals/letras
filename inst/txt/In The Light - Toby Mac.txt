"1" "In The Light
Toby Mac

I wanna be in the light as you are in the light
I wanna shine like the stars in the heavens
Oh, lord be my light and be my salvation
Cause all i want is to be in the light

I wanna be in the light you are in the light
I wanna shine like the stars in heavens

Oh, lord be my light and be my salvation
Cause all i want is to be in the light
Yeah all i want is to be in the light

There is no other place that i'd rather be,
There is no other that's right for me that in your light in your light
There is no other place that i'd rather be,
There is no other that's right for me that in your light in you light
That in your that in your light in your light."
