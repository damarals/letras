Newsboys

All creatures of our God and king
Lift up your voice and with us sing
Oh praise him hallelujah
Thou burning sun with golden beam
Thou silver moon with softer gleam
Oh praise him, oh praise him hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Thou rushing wind that art so strong
Ye clouds that sail in heaven along
Oh praise him hallelujah
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice
Ye lights of evening find a voice
Oh praise him, oh praise him hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Let all things their creator bless
And worship in humbleness
Oh praise him hallelujah
Praise, praise the father, praise the son
And praise the spirit three in one
Oh praise him, oh praise him
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hands go up
Heaven come down
Giving him praise is the only sound"
