Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
Cause when I feel afraid, I think I've lost my way
There you are right beside me
Jesus be my guide and hold me to your side
Please be near me to the end

Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path

Cause when I feel afraid, I think I've lost my way
There you are right beside me
Jesus be my guide and hold me to your side
Please be near me to the end

Cause when I feel afraid, I think I've lost my way

Shout to God with joy

All your heart and soul and your strength..."
