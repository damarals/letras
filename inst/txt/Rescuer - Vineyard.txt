Vineyard

You came to rescue, You came to save
You came to free us from the power of the grave
You came to find us, to draw us near
You came to heal and wipe away every tear

Rescuer, strong deliverer, all our hope, is in Your name
Mighty God, Mighty Saviour, only You have power to save

You're here with freedom, here with life
Here to overcome the dark with radiant light
You're here with mercy, here with grace
By Your Spirit You are moving in this place

You are moving here, we believe You're near
Jesus You are all we need
So we're reaching out, for the Saviour's hand
Jesus You are all we need"
