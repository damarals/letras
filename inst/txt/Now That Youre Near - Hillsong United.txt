Hillsong United

Hold me in your arms
Never let me go
I want to spend eternity with you

I stand before You Lord
And give You all my praise
Your love is all I need
Jesus You're all I need
My life belongs to You
You gave Your life for me
Your grace is all I need
Jesus You're all I need

Hold me in your arms
Never let me go
I want to spend eternity with you

And now that You're near
Everything is different
Everything's so different Lord
I know I'm not the same
My life You changed
I want to be with You (2X)

I stand before You Lord
And give You all my praise
Your love is all I need
Jesus You're all I need
My life belongs to You
You gave Your life for me
Your grace is all I need
Jesus You're all I need

Hold me in your arms
Never let me go
I want to spend eternity with you

And now that You're near
Everything is different
Everything's so different Lord (2X tudo)
I know I'm not the same
My life You changed
I want to be with You(2X)

And I will sing for You always
Cause in Your presence God is where I want to stay

Hold me in your arms
Never let me go
I want to spend eternity with you

And now that You're near
Everything is different
Everything's so different Lord (2X tudo)
I know I'm not the same
My life You changed
I want to be with You(2X)"
