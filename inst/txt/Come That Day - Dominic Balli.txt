"1" "Come That Day
Dominic Balli

There will come a day
There will come a day

One and all we beg for bread we
Could feed each other but we fight instead
When will this all end will it ever end
Fire in the hallway blood at our feet
Everybody's running from a bomb in the street oh
When will this all end will it ever end

There will come a day when we will be together
And there'll be no more pain
Come that day come that day
We will find the way through beauty and disaster
'Til that day 'til that day
Come that day come that day

We lose our friends we'll lose our lovers
Hold so tight but lose each other
When will this all end will it ever end
When the child and the lion lay in peace
No victim no enemy
No victim no enemy


No more injustice and hate
No more suffering
Oppression, and division
Will no longer be the way
No more imagining

Can you see what I see
Dreams a reality
Can you see
Can you see what I see"
