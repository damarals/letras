"x"
"1" "Promise
Delirious

Do I wipe a tear or do I spit in your face?
Do I point a finger or give a hand of grace?
Oh why does it come to this?

Is it freedom that you want or are the chains in your head?
Can a man play God when he made his own bed?
Oh why does it come to this?

Whatever happened to the love that you made?
Whatever happened to the prayer that you prayed?
Whatever happened to a promise these days?

Did the earth disappear when you told of the truth
of the worlds you would conquer and the mountains you'd move?
Oh why does it come to this?

Did you covenant or live a dream in your head?
Would you die for her or rather raise the dead?
Oh when will I learn from this?

I'm falling into you (x 4)
