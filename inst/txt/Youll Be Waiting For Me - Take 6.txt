"1" "You'll Be Waiting For Me
Take 6

Too many times I've find
Another chance a better time
'Cause I believe
You'll be waiting for me

I traveled deep inside
On a magic carpet ride
To break those chains that bind
I found the strength somewhere
I never knew was there
Left my fears behind

And I can see it clear
A special place not far from here
Folow my destiny
Where I believe
You'll be waiting for me

Bridge:
One steadfast soldier
Riding on his roller coaster
Just waiting a safe heaven
Someone to love and can lean on
Just lean on...

And I now someday I'll find
Another chance a better time
My spirit will dance free
So joyful I will be
And I believe
You'll be waiting for me"
