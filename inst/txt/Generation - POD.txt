P.O.D.

Hey pretty lady, why you lookin so grey?
Why are you worried about tommorrow, if living is for today?
Time flies, keep passing you by.
They see you going under, and they all wonder why
Oh why, can you hear the voices saying

It's alright, It's alright
This is our Generation!
And it'll be your time
In this situation
You better hold on tight
Break the foundation
You got to live your life
In this Generation

Hey pretty baby, why they look in your eyes?
Your gonna make it in this lifetime, daddy make it alright.
Sun shines, keep your head up towards the light
Release the soul is burning so you can learn to fly,
So fly, It's only yours if you take it

It's alright, It's alright
This is our Generation!
And it'll be your time
In this situation
You better hold on tight
Break the foundation
You got to live your life
In this Generation

And it'll be alright, and it's alright.
And it'll be your time, In this Generation
You better hold on tight, In this Generation
You gotta live your life, In this Generation
And it'll be alright, In this Generation
And it'll be your time, In this situation
You gotta hold on tight, Break the foundation
You got to life your life, In this Generation
You got to live your life"
