Checkmate, pull the plug on a fake
Get to steppin too late, gotta take em, break em down
One testify, see the fire in his eyes
We determine the ghost when a warrior cries that sound
Spirit flips, soul spits. Meditate on the words from the King's lips
Apocalyptic, psalm scripted, prophet's eyes
Armageddon come quick, It's a death wish, of a white witch
Come inside and I'll tell you were the beast live
Come inside and I'll tell you were the beast live

Soul that's raised by a rush through your veins
Gonna bring the pain, You can see it's goin down
Frontline, nobody left behind. Rebel soul, let em know
when it's time you better hold your ground.
Regulate, interrogate, cause the enemies loose and he's out for the take
Under no faith, leaving no trace, another one took by an old hate
It's a death wish, of a white witch
Come inside and I'll tell you where the beast live
Come inside and I'll tell you where the beast live

Who's got that witch? Who's got that witch? Who's got that witch?
Who's got that witch? Who's got that witch? Who's got that witch?
Who's got that witch? Who's got that witch? Who's got that witch?
Who's got that witch? Who's got that witch? Who's got that witch?
Who's got that witch? Who's got that witch?

Be not far from me,
For trouble is near,
And there is none to help.
