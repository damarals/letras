"1" "I Am Yours
Lauren Daigle

I see your fingerprints
The work of your hands
It's all in your hands
I see the evidence
Leaving nothing to chance
The world's in your hands

So I rest in your promises
Now I am sure of this
I'm yours
Let the waters rise
I will stand as the oceans roar
Let the earth shake beneath me
Let the mountains fall
You are God over the storm
I am yours

I hear the voice of love
Calling me home
To where I belong
It cripples every fear
And the ones who will kneel
Will walk away healed

So I rest in your promises
Now I am sure of this
I'm yours, I am yours
No power is strong enough
To separate me from your love
I'm yours

Even the thunder and the wind obey
At the command of my father, (my) father
I set my feet upon your mighty name
So let the rain fall harder, harder
So take my everything, my flesh and blood
I'll lay me down on the altar, altar
I am forever covered in your love
So let the rain fall harder, harder"
