Gaither Vocal Band

Come ye sinners, lost and lonely
Jesus' blood can make you free.
For he saved the worst among you
When He saved a wretch like me

and I know, yes, i know,
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean.
and I know, yes, i know,
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean.

To the faint He giveth power
Through the mountains makes a away
Findeth water in the desert
Turns the night to golden day.

In temptation He is near thee,
Holds the powers of Hell at bay.
Guides you to the path of safety
Gives you grace for every day.

Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean.

Uuuu, uuuu…
I’t’s the blood of Jesus
can make you clean.


Whoa. The blood of Jesus"
