"1" "Suspended In You
Skillet

Thought You'd put me in a box
Thought You'd push me into a clump
Make me smaller than I was before
Though You'd press me Ã± mold me in
Took a step and felt the pressure on
Exploding me into open space

Now You pull me apart
I'm suspended in You
Stretch me bigger
Reveal Yourself to be
The frame that holds me tightly in center
Pulled into suspension in the middle of You

Let what was hidden be reveal
Walls of fear broken wide
Infinite Jesus spread all in You
Towering over the horizons
Gushing with surrender in Your hands

Now You pull me apart
I'm suspended in You
Stretch me bigger
Reveal Yourself to be
The frame that holds me tightly in center
Pulled into suspension in the middle of You
