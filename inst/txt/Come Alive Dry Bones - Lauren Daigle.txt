"1" "Come Alive (Dry Bones)
Lauren Daigle

Through the eyes of men
It seems there's so much
We have lost

As we look down the road
Where all the prodigals
Have walked
And one by one
The enemy has whispered lies
And led them off as slaves

But we know that you are God
Yours is the victory
We know there is more to come
That we may not yet see
So with the faith you've given us
We'll step into the valley unafraid, yeah

As we call out to dry bones
Come alive, come alive
And we call out to dead hearts
Come alive, come alive
Come up out of the ashes
Let us see an army rise
We call out to dry bones come alive

Oh God of endless mercy
God of unrelenting love
Rescue every daughter
Bring us back the wayward son
By your spirit breathe upon them
Show that you alone can save
You alone can save

As we call out to dry bones
Come alive, come alive
And we call out to dead hearts
Come alive, come alive
Come up out of the ashes
Let us see an army rise
We call out to dry bones come alive, yeah

So breathe, oh breath of God
Now breathe, breath of God
Breathe oh breath of God
Now breathe
Oh breathe, breath of God
Now breathe, oh breath of God
Breathe, oh breath of God, now breathe

As we call out to dry bones
Come alive, come alive
And we call out to dead hearts
Come alive, come alive
Come up out of the ashes
Let us see an army rise
We call out to dry bones come alive, yeah
We call out to dry bones... Come alive"
