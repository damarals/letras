"1" "A Quiet Place
Take 6

There is a quiet place
Far from the rapid pace
Where God can soothe my troubled mind

Sheltered by tree and flowÂ´r
There in my quiet hour
With Him my cares are left behind

Whether a garden small
Or on a mountain tall

New strength and courage there I find
Then from this quiet place
I go prepared to face
A new day with love for all mankind

[repeat]"
