Love Song

Save the sadness for another time
Save the words for a song that rhymes
Save the crying for the ones who've lied
Who've missed all the meaning
And their souls have died

Save the doubting for the morning sun
Bringing daylight where there once was none
Feel the warmth that each new day can bring
By believing,....by receiving Him

Feel the love
Feel the love

Save the heartaches for the yesterday's
Now's the time to change our foolish ways
Feel the love the Son of God can bring
By believing, by receiving Him

Feel the love
Feel the love"
