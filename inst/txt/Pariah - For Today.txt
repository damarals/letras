For Today

I will never bow down to your idols
I know who I am
You'll have to put me in the ground
To silence me
This is my final stand

You can't kill me, I'm already dead
This is the martyr's cry
So as the crowd demands my head
My time has come to die

Death is only the beginning of everything I'm living for
This is my final stand
Laid upon the altar
This is my final stand
Laid upon the altar
This is my final stand

Stand up, my convictions are not for sale
And I know who I am
They can't deny the truth inside me
So I will suffer at their hands
Dragged through the streets like a criminal
My my own flesh and blood
Guilty by association
There is hell to pay for this apostate son

Kill him!
The self-righteous scream
He serves a new king
Kill him!

Their blind eyes can't see
I serve the true king
Now the rocks start flying
And my mouth it fills with blood
I can hear my mother crying
But one voice is not enough
I was facing the full wrath of hell

Feeble as it is
I was facing a good death as well
This is glorious
Face to face with the grave
I was waiting for
And now my killers were
Face to face with a faith that they can't ignore
This is my final stand

I will never bow down to your idols
I know who I am
You'll have to put me in the ground
To silence me
This is my final stand

You can't kill me, I'm already dead
This is the martyr's cry
So as the crowd demands my head
My time has come to die"
