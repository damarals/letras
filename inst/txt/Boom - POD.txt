"1" "Boom
P.O.D.

I never knew that a kid like me
Could take his mic around the world
And flash the big sd
And rock the masses
From madrid to calabasses
Tijuana, mexico
Bootleg demos in tokyo
They know me though
Cause I be puttin work
Commit my life to rebirth
Well respected
Cause that's my word
I'm sure you heard
About a new sound going around
She might have left my hood
But she was born in my town

(Bridge)
You didn't know that we was new on the scene
Well it's alright it's alright!
I know you know
I see you smiling at me
Well it's alright it's alright!

(Chorus)
Boom
Here comes the
Boom
Ready or not
Here comes the boys from the south
*repeat*

We rep. The south
So what you talking abou
I'm not running off my moth
I know this without a doubt
Cause if you know these streets
Then these streets know you
When it's time to handle business
Then you know what to do
Me and my crew
We stay true old skool or new
Many were called
But chosen are few
We rise to the top
What you want?
Just in case you forgot
Rush to the stage
Grab my mic
Show me what you got!

(bridge and chorus)

(bridge)

Is that all you got?
I'l take your best shot

(Chorus 2x)"
