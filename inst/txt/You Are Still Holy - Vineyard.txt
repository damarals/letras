"1" "You Are Still Holy
Vineyard

Holy, You are still holy
Even when the darkness surrounds my life

Sovereign, You are still sovereign

Even when confusion has blinded my eyes

Lord I don't deserve Your kind affection

When my unbelief has kept me from Your touch

I want my life to be a pure
reflection

Of Your love

CHORUS
So I come into Your chambers
And I dance at Your feet, Lord
You are my Savior
And I'm at Your mercy
All that has been in my life up to now
Belongs to You

You are still holy"
