He makes a resting-place for me in the green fields:
He is my guide by the quiet waters.
He gives new life to my soul:
He is my guide in the ways of righteousness because of his name.

Yes, though I go through the valley of deep shade,
I will have no fear of evil;
For you are with me,
Your rod and your support are my comfort.

You make ready a table for me in front of my haters:
You put oil on my head;
My cup is overflowing.
Truly, blessing and mercy will be with me all the
days of my life;
And I will have a place in the house of the Lord all my days."
