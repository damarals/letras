Delirious

With You

Ooh ooh ooh just another day
When being with you
shines a light as I go my way
Oh ooh ooh just another day
Another moment you and
I can take it all the way
And its OK cos

Im with you, Im with you, only you
To steal another day, is all thats on my mind
And Im staying here to find that
Im with you

Ooh ooh ooh nothing left to say
When my heart it burns with holy fire
dont get in my way
Ooh ooh ooh give it all away
Got to keep these clean hands dirty
if Im gonna to stay awake
But its OK

You never let me go
You never let me fall
I know youre in this pain
And when Ive got it all
And Im clinging on to you
Cos its all that we can do
Cos knowing you is beautiful
