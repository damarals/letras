"1" "In The Middle
Jimmy Needham

I remember it was later in december when we got the call
Dead of winter cut deep like a splinter from the weight of it all
When the news came, for me the hardest part of all
Was to see you sitting there so brokenhearted

I'd forgotten how it felt to hit the bottom when you suffer pain
It was like tryin' to run a hundred miles in the pourin' rain
But the truth is not even storms can kill this flame
My promise to you always remains
In the middle of the cold, dark knight
In the middle it'll be all right
I will be there, I will be there
And if pain is the ocean you are swimmin' in
If I can't pull you out, I'm dyin' in

Never thought I could love anyone the way I loved you
And if it took my life I'd fight to protect you, too
But I was helpless and there was nothing I could do
So I'll just wrap my arms around you and say

I believe that god was there
Watching over us
I believe he heard our prayers
He cried along with us
Even when our hearts are scared
He's closer than he seems
And I can hear him sing

In the middle of the cold, dark night
In the middle it'll be all right
I will be there, I will be there
And if pain is the ocean you are swimmin' in
You can rest assured that I'll be divin' in

In the middle of the cold, dark night
In the middle it'll be all right
I will be there, I will be there
And if pain is the ocean you are swimmin' in
Like I've done before, I'm divin' in
I am divin'
I am divin' in"
