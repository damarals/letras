"1" "Proof Of Our Love
Fireflight

So far away from the lives we lead each day.
Love as voices hunger, and there's no shelter from danger.
All this love we talk about, talking won't put food into their mouths.

Don't look away, don't look away
Why don't we do something?
Why don't we do something?
(if we say that we love them?)
Don't turn away, don't turn away
Let's open up our eyes,
Bring our faith to life.
(this is proof of our love.)
This is proof of our love.

Harder to see than the problems we perceive.
We're sickness, fast on our apathy and there's no way to the suffering.
All this hope we talk about, wishing won't help those who go without.

Don't look away, don't look away
Why don't we do something?
Why don't we do something?
(if we say that we love them?)
Don't turn away, don't turn away
Let's open up our eyes, bring our faith to life.
(this is proof of our love.)
This is proof of our love.

Indifference will not defeat us.

Don't look away, don't look away
Why don't we do something?
Why don't we do something?
(if we say that we love them?)
Don't turn away, don't turn away
Let's open up our eyes, bring our faith to life.
(this is proof of our love.)
This is proof of our love.

Why don't we do something?
(if we say that we love them?)
Where's the proof of our love?
Let's open up our eyes.
(this is proof of our love)
This is proof of our love."
