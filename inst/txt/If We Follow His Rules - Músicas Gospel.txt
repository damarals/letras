"1" "If We Follow His Rules
MÃºsicas Gospel

He only gave us ten,
For us to obey.
But if we follow them,
We'll have better days.

They're called golden rules,
And he wrote them in stone.
He said if they're obeyed,
He'll walk us back home.

Chorus:
The Bible speaks his words,
That were written and heard.
If we follow his rules,
We'll be nobody's fool.
We can climb heaven's stairs,
Where love is everywhere.
We'll walk his golden streets,
When our life is complete.

If we follow his rules,
He'll help us pull through.
He will walk beside us,
In all that we do.

He's not asking much,
In the things that he ask.
None of them are hard,
They're all simple task.

Chorus:
The Bible speaks his words,
That were written and heard.
If we follow his rules,
We'll be nobody's fool.
We can climb heaven's stairs,
Where love is everywhere.
We'll walk his golden streets,
When our life is complete.

We can climb heaven's stairs,
Where love is everywhere.
We'll walk his golden streets,
When our life is complete."
