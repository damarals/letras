"1" "Trough Many Ways
Suellen Lima

I walked trough many ways
shattered dreams all of my days
the heavy cross was on my sholder,
made me fell so tired and sad
lingering ters and endless fountain,
on my face go rolling down
only you my dear Jesus,
would take my hand and guide me now...
if you don't leave your holy spirit,
I'm safe I have no fear
even way all things go stray,
you Lord Jesus here willstay
and wen the time is come,
you that land I wanna be,I wanna be
far beyond this earth and sun,
Jesus face then I you see"
