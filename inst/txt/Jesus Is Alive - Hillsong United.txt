"1" "Jesus Is Alive
Hillsong United

Hallelujah Jesus is alive
Death has lost its victory
And the grave has been denied
Jesus lives forever
He's alive, He's alive

He's the alpha and omega
The first and last is he
The couse of sin is broken
And we are perfect liberty
Lamb of god has risen
He's alive, He's alive

Hallelujah, Jesus is alive"
