"1" "There Is None Like You
Hillsong United

There is none like You
No one else can touch my heart like You do
I could search for all eternity long
And find
There is none like You

Your mercy flows like a river wide
And healing comes in Your Name
Helpless children are safe in Your arms
And there is none like you"
