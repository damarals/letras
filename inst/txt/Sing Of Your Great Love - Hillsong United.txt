"1" "Sing Of Your Great Love
Hillsong United

All that is within me Lord
Will bless Your holy name
I live my life to worship You alone
You brought me out of darkness and
Into Your glorious light
Forever I will sing of Your great love
Forever I will sing of Your great love

I love to see You glorified
To see You lifted high
I yearn to see all nations bow their knee
It’s You alone Lord Jesus
Who can cause the coldest heart
To find Your love and everlasting peace
To find Your love and everlasting peace

Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord

Your trumpet will sound
And all the heavens will know
That the time has finally come
For the bride to take her place
And we’ll hear the angels sing"
