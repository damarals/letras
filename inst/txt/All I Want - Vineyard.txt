"1" "All I Want
Vineyard

In the morning when I rise
Expectantly I lift my eyes
and I see you, (and I see you)
Gazing on your heavenly throne
In your presence I'm at home,
Here with you, (here with you)

(And) All I want is more and more of you
Earthly cares and passions pale
When you take away the veil
and I see you, (and I see you)
When you open heaven's door
All I want to have is more,
more of you, (more of you)

Earth and all it's glory will fade
But the word of our God will stand
The earth and all it's glory will fade
But the kingdom of God I will seek

Nothing in the world compares
To the love that I can share alone with you, (alone with you)
There is nothing else so real
As the things that you reveal
When I'm with you, (when I'm with you)"
