"1" "Here I Am To Worship
Diante do Trono

Light of the world You stepped down into the darkness
Opened my eyes let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You

(Chorus)

Here I am to worship Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days Oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross

Call upon the Name of the Lord and be saved
Call upon the Name of the Lord and be saved"
