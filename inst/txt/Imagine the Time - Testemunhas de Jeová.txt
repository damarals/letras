"1" "Imagine the Time
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

Life is hard and it wears us down
There's not enough to go around
I close my eyes and there I see
That every hope has come to be

Imagine the time when there's no more pain
When life's so good and we are young again
Imagine the time when we wake up and say
Thank you, thank you, for this new life
And this brand new day

Not a sound has ever touched my ears
And eyes grow dim with passing years
But ears will hear when music plays
And eyes will see each brand new day

Imagine the time when there's no more pain
When life's so good and we are young again
Imagine the time when we wake up and say
Thank you, thank you, for this new life
And this brand new day

I might not be the way I want to be
But one day soon I'll be running free!

Imagine the time when there's no more pain
When life's so good and we are young again
Imagine the time when we're dancing out the door
Every day is better than before

Imagine the time when there's no more pain
When life's so good and we are young again
Imagine the time when we wake up and say
Thank you, thank you, for this brand new day"
