"1" "You Said
Hillsong United

You said ask and you will receive
Whatever You need
You said pray and I’ll hear from heaven
And I’ll heal Your land

You said Your glory will fill the earth
Like water the seas
You said lift up your eyes
The harvest is here
The kingdom is near
You said

Ask and I’ll give the nations to You
O Lord
That’s the cry of my heart
Distant shores and the islands Will see
Your light
As it rises on us"
