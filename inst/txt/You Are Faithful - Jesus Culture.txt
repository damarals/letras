My heart aches for You, my God
My soul waits for You, my God
I've come far to find You here
In this place will I draw near

And Your spirit soars with me
To the highest heights
From where I'll not look back
I'll keep trusting You

For I know
You are faithful
My God
(2x)

My heart aches for You, my God
My soul waits for You, my God
I've come far to find You here
In this place will I draw near

And your spirit soars with me
To the highest heights
From where I'll not look back, no
I'll keep trusting You

From the land of the barren
We will cry out for rain
Fill our hearts, God
I'll keep trusting You

For I know
You are faithful
My God

For I know
You are faithful
My God
(3x)

You are

For I know

Your spirit inside me holds me close
In Your wonderful presence I let go
I cleanse my hands, You burn my heart
I cry out for love, You set me apart
(2x)

And Your spirit soars in me
To the highest height
From where I?ll not look back, no
I'll keep trusting you

From the land of the barren
We will cry out for rain
Rain God
Fill our hearts, God
I'll keep trusting You

For I know
You are faithful
My God

For I know

My God

For I know
You are faithful
My God"
