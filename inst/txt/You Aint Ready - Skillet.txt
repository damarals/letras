"1" "You Ain't Ready
Skillet

You ain't ready
You ain't ready
You ain't ready
You ain't, you ain't ready for me

A little bit of love, a little bit of great
A little bit of pain and misery
A little bit of strife in life
I fight and I survive
My back is gettin' pushed up against the wall
I'm never givin' up, I give my all
I'm never lookin' back, attack
My fear, it's in the past

Stand up, stand up
Stand up, you ain't ready for me

Give me your best shot, the stronger I stand
Not lookin' for sympathy
What doesn't kill me makes me who I am
A soldier fights till he's free
You ain't ready for me

You ain't ready (No)
You ain't ready (No)
You ain't ready (No)
You ain't, you ain't ready for me (Me, me)

A little bit of hope, a little bit of hurt
A little bit of \"Get what you deserve\"
Trodding through the mud and blood
Can't help, I've had enough
Am I gettin' through? Try to come alive
Do you wanna live before you die?
Hold on to your truth till you break through
You'll never lose

Stand up, stand up
Stand up, you ain't ready for me

Give me your best shot, the stronger I stand
Not lookin' for sympathy
What doesn't kill me makes me who I am
A soldier fights till he's free
You ain't ready for me

You ain't ready (No)
You ain't ready (No)
You ain't ready (No)
You ain't, you ain't ready for me

Stand up, stand up
Facin' the lions
Stand up
You ain't ready for, you ain't ready for
Stand up, stand up
Facin' the fire
Stand up
You ain't ready for, you ain't ready for me
You ain't ready for me

Give me your best shot, the stronger I stand
Not lookin' for sympathy
What doesn't kill me makes me who I am
A soldier fights till he's free
You ain't ready for me

You ain't ready (No)
You ain't ready (No)
You ain't ready (No)
You ain't, you ain't ready for me"
