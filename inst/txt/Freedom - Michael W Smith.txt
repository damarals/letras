Michael W. Smith

where the spirit of the Lord is
there is freedom
where the spirit of the Lord is
there is freedom

lift your eyes to heaven
there is freedom
lift your eyes to heaven
there is freedom

freedom reings in this place
showers of mercy and grace
falling on every face
there is freedom
Jesus reigns in this place
showers of mercy and grace
falling on every face
there is freedom

ever time you're thirsty
there is freedom
every time you're thirsty
there is freedom

give you all to Jesus
there is freedom
give you all to Jesus
there is freedom

freedom reings in this place
showers of mercy and grace
falling on every face
there is freedom
Jesus reigns in this place
showers of mercy and grace
falling on every face
there is freedom

freedom reings in this place
showers of mercy and grace
falling on every face
there is freedom
Jesus reigns in this place
showers of mercy and grace
falling on every face
there is freedom"
