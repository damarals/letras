"1" "Nothing Is Beyond You
Amy Grant

Intro

Where could I go?
Where could I run?
Even if I found the strength to fly

And if I rose
On the wings of a dawn
And crashed through the corners of the sky

If I sailed past the edge of the sea
Even if I made my bed of nails
Still there you would find me

Chorus

Cause nothing is beyond you
You stand beyond the reach
Of our thin imaginations
Our misguided priorities
The Heaven's tries to hold you
And deep cries out to deap sea
And there is nothing is beyond you
Nothing is beyond you
Time can not contain you
You fill Eternity
Sin can never restrain you
Death has lost it's sting
And I can not explain the way
You came to loving me
Except to say nothing is beyond you
Nothing is beyond you

If I should shrink
Back away from the light
Well I can sing into the dark

If I take cover
And I close my eyes
Even then you would see my heart

You cut through all my pain and rage
The darkness is my guard to you
And night is as bright as day

Chorus

Nothing is beyond you
