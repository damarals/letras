"1" "Great Is Your Faithness
Newsboys

If I rise on wings of dawn
Or drift in seas of doubt
Even there, your strong right hand
Has never failed to guide me out

(chorus)
Great is Your faithfullness
To carry on with a sinner like me
Great is Your faithfullness
Turning shame into victory
Your grace has never let me be
Your mercy's waited patiently
Oh, so great is Your faitfullness
To carry on with a sinner like me

If I hide in dark and shadows
Fearfull of each day
Even there
Your blinding light illuminates my pathway

(chorus)

Lord, Your goodness
Goodness never
Never fails
It never fails me

(chorus)"
