"1" "Should We Give Less Than God
MÃºsicas Gospel

God placed no value,
On the love he gave.
Sacrificed his son,
So we could be saved.

It doesn't cost a cent,
To give someone a smile.
But it can mean so much.
If it lingers for awhile.

Should we give less than God,
When we show our love.
Is he pleased with all he sees,
Does he think we lovein' enough.

It's only cost some time,
To give peace of mind.
When you lend a hand,
And help when you can.

Jesus suffered his pain,
And freed us of blame.
His blood was the price,
He was man's sacrifice.

Should we give less than God,
When we show our love.
Is he pleased with all he sees,
Does he think we lovein' enough."
