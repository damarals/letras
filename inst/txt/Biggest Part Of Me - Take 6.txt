"1" "Biggest Part Of Me
Take 6

(Sunrise) There's a new sun arisin'
(In your eyes) I can see a new horizon
(Realize) That will keep me realizin'
You're the biggest part of me

(Through the night) No more feeling here beside me
(Shine the light) Need you close enough to guide me
(For all my life) I've been hopin' He would find me
You're the biggest part of me
Well
Make a wish (make a wish)
When you love Him, you make it come true
Make a list (make a list)
Of the things He'll do for you
Ain't no risk now,
In lettin' His love rain down on you,
If I wash away the past,
So that we may start anew

(Rainbow) Risin' over my shoulder;
(Love flows) Gettin' stronger as we're older
(All I know) All I wanna do is server Him
He's the life that breathes in me
(Forever) If you work you say forever
(Together) People only be together
(For better) And for me, there's nothin' better
You're the biggest part of me

Well
Make a wish (make a wish)
When you love Him, you make it come true
Make a list (make a list)
Of the things He'll do for you
Ain't no risk now,
In lettin' His love rain down on you,
If I wash away the past,
So that we may start anew

Oh

More than an easy feelin'
(He’s my rejoicing)
How can I tell you
What He means to me?

Make a wish (make a wish)
When you love, you make it come true
Make a list (make a list)
Of the things He'll do for you
Ain't no risk, now,
In lettin' His love rain down on you,
If I wash away the past,
So that we may start anew

(Rainbow) Risin' over my shoulder;
(Love flows) Gettin' stronger as we're older
(All I know) All I wanna do is server Him
He's the life that breathes in me
(Forever) If you work you say forever
(Together) People only be together
(For better) And for me, there's nothin' better
You're the biggest part of me
You’re the life that breathes in me
(Here’s the biggest part) the biggest part of me"
