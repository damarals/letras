"1" "Into My Heart / Fairest Lord Jesus
Selah

Into my heart, into my heart
Come into my heart, Lord Jesus
Come in today, come in to stay
Come into my heart, Lord Jesus

Fairest Lord Jesus, ruler of all nature
O thou of God and man the Son
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor
Thou my soul's glory, joy and crown

Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight
And all the twinkling starry host
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer
Than all the angels heaven can boast

Beautiful Savior, Lord of all the nations
Son of God and Son of man
Glory and honor, praise, adoration
Now and forever more be Thine
Now and forever more be Thine"
