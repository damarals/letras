Casting Crowns

I will love you, Lord always
Not just for the things you done for me
I will praise you all my days
Not just for the change you've made in me.
But I'll praise you for you are Holy Lord
And I lift my hands but you are worthy of so much more

For You are awesome God of the Nations
Lion of Judah, Rock of the Ages
Alpha, Omega. Worthy of all praise
More than the hands I raise

I'll live a life of praise
I'll live a life of praise

I will serve You, Lord always
For You are my strength when I am weak
And I will never be afraid
For You are my rock and You protect me
But I'll praise You, for You are Hold Lord
And I'll lift my hand but You are worthy of so much more

For You are awesome God of the Nations
Lion of Judah, Rock of the Ages
Alpha, Omega. Worthy of all praise
More than the hands I raise
You're worthy of all praise"
