"1" "The One Who Is
Nívea Soares

I can hear the sound of the waters of the rivers of my God
I can hear the sound of rain that will come over this desert
I can feel the wind of Spirit bringing life to these dry bones
I can feel the mountains trembling as the hear the voice of the Almighty, our God

The One who was
And who Is
The One who Is to come
He comes over me

We’re the generation of those who love Your presence
We’re the generation of those who seek Your face

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus"
