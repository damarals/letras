"1" "Holy
Marina de Oliveira

Holy, Holy,
There' S Power In You Name Your Name Is Holly
Holy, Holy,
Let Us Lift Up Our Hands, In Worship To The Lamb
Almighty King, For Your Name Is Holy
Oh! My Lord Here I Am
Just To Say How Much I Love You
So In This Quiet Place I Stand,
To Relie Upon Your Word
Upon That Cross You Died For Me
And With You Died All My Sins
So More Than Words Could Ever Say
(Listen To Me Now)
I Wanna Trank You For That Day"
