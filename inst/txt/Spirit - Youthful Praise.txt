Verse:
When Jesus ascended to Heaven
He said I won't leave you alone
But I'll send you a comfort
So you won't be on your own
He sent us a paraclete, mediator
Advocate and reminder

Chorus:
We need Him
Can't live without Him
He is the spirit of God
The sweet holy spirit of God

He comes to dwell within us
He is the spirit
To comfort and keep us
Oh yes

Chorus

Vamp:
He is the spirit
The holy spirit

He is the spirit of God"
