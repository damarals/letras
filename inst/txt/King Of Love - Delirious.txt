"1" "King Of Love
Delirious

King of Love you've called my name
You gave me life although the shame,
Had covered me, you took my hand,
And here I stand, I'm saved by grace.

Father God, you heard the prayer
From deep within my spirit cried
If there's a God, come rescue me,
Now here I stand, I'm saved by grace.

I will thank you for saving my soul,
For you've shown me the truth in your Word,
I will take up my cross and follow you,
Now I live for the glory of God.

Now we turn, to walk away,
From selfishness, the pride and hate,
And when we pass through stony ground,
We'll gladly walk upon our knees,
So we cry out, \"Come change us Lord,
Into a church that loves your Word\"
We will return to knowing you,
With joy we walk beneath the Cross.

We will thank you for saving our souls,
For you've shown us the truth in your Word,
We will take up the Cross and follow you,
Now we live for the glory of God.
Now we live for the glory of God.
Now we live for the glory of God."
