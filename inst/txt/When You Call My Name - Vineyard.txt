"1" "When You Call My Name
Vineyard

There’s a hunger in this wilderness for Your revelation

To hear the words of life that strengthen me
Come and show what You’ve prepared for me

Speak your confirmation
Show me how I fit into Your plan

For when You call my name I can see again
Who You are and who I’m meant to be

And as you beckon me I am free to see
Who You are and who I’m sent to be

I am seeking true identity in the light of Your presence
I am longing to know how You see me

In the time that You have given me, release the strength to follow
And the grace to be who You say I am"
