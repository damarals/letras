Toby Mac

Happy birthday Jesus
Let's celebrate the birth of Love

She was only 13
Young with a big dream
Then, unexpectedly, things would never be the same
Love was born, and she held a gift God made
Born for redemption's sake
Earth was void 'til He came
Love was born a, love was born a King

Now we all sing
L-o-v-e, L-o-v-e, L-o-v-e
Everybody sing
L-o-v-e, L-o-v-e, L-o-v-e
Love, love, love, love, love, la, la, love
Let's celebrate, let's celebrate
Let's celebrate the birth of love
Love, love, love, love, love, la, la, love
It's Your birthday, it's a new day, it's the true way, in His love

Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
Let's follow the beat of the drum
Doesn't matter where you come from
Let's come together as one and celebrate, let's celebrate
Let's take this love, and let's elevate
To a place where we can conversate
And share our New Year's dreams over grandma's hot plates
Hey, hey, hey, hey everybody
Let's celebrate that beautiful love
Hey, hey, everybody
Let's celebrate that beautiful love
No silent night, no jingle bells
We gonna rock tonight
We gonna rock this love

Rock the love
L-o-v-e, L-o-v-e, L-o-v-e
Rock the love
L-o-v-e, L-o-v-e, L-o-v-e
Love, love, love, love, love, la, la, love
Let's celebrate, let's celebrate
Let's celebrate the birth of love
Love, love, love, love, love, la, la, love
It's Your birthday, it's a new day, it's the true way, in His love

Now we welcome everybody to this beautiful celebration
We're celebrating the birth of love
