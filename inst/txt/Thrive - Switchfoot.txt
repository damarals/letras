Switchfoot

Been fighting things that I can't see, yeah
Like voices coming from the inside of me, yeah
Like doing things I find hard to believe in
Am I myself or am I dreaming?

I've been awake for an hour or so
Checking for a pulse but I just don't know
Am I man if I feel like ghost?
The stranger in the mirror is wearing my clothes

No I'm not alright
I know that I'm not right
The steering wheel doesn't mean you can drive
A warm body doesn't mean I'm alive

No I'm not alright
I know that I'm not right
Feel like I travel but I never arrive
I want to thrive, not just survive

I come alive when I hear you singing
But lately I haven't been hearing a thing, yeah
I get the feeling that I'm between
A machine and a man who only looks like me

I try and hide it, not let it show
But deep down inside me I just don't know
Am I man if I feel like a hoax?
The stranger in the mirror is wearing my clothes

No I'm not alright
I know that I'm not right
The steering wheel doesn't mean you can drive
A warm body doesn't mean I'm alive

No I'm not alright
I know that I'm not right
Feel like I travel but I never arrive
I want to thrive, not just survive

I'm always close and never enough
I get so down, but I won't give up
I get so down, but I won't give up
get so down, but I won't give up

Been fighting things that I can't see, yeah
Like voices coming from the inside of me, yeah
Like doing things I find hard to believe in
Am I myself or am I dreaming?

Thrive, thrive, thrive

No I'm not alright
I know that I'm not right
The steering wheel doesn't mean you can drive
A warm body doesn't mean I'm alive

No I'm not alright
I know that I'm not right
Feel like I travel but I never arrive
I want to thrive, not just survive"
