"1" "The Difference
Hillsong United

Verse 1:
You are the difference in us
You've broken the past
And set us apart

Verse 2:
You caused the darkness to end
You lifted our heads
To know You again

PreChorus:
Lord You bring us to life
In You our hope will rise

Chorus:
We are found
And there's nothing that
Could hold us down
With anything against us
We know that Your love will
Be the difference
Be the difference
You give and take
Still we'll go Your way
All our fear is in the distance
We know that Your love will
Be the difference
Be the difference

Verse 3:
You define reason with love
Took the former through us
You are alone are enough
Though we will destined to fail
You opened the way
And broke every chain

Bridge:
You awaken our hearts
To You we know who we are
You're the change in us
The change in us we know"
