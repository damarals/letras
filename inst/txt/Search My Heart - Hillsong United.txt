Hillsong United

Search my heart and search my soul
There is nothing else that I want more
Shine your light and show your face
In my life Lord have your way

Hear my cry and hear my pray
Draw me close
I know your near

Give me strength and give me grace
To walk with you
Lord, all my days

So with all my heart and all my soul
With all I am lord I'll follow you
You took the cross, you took my shame
Restored my life
Now I live to worship you

Without you I'm nothing

So with all my heart and all my soul
With all I am lord I'll follow you
You took the cross, you took my shame
Restored my life
Now I live to worship you

Search my heart and search my soul
There is nothing else that I want more

So with all my heart and all my soul
With all I am lord I'll follow you
You took the cross, you took my shame
Restored my life, lord, I will follow you

Without you I'm nothing

So with all my heart and all my soul
With all I am Lord I'll follow you
You took the cross, you took my shame
Restored my life, Lord, I will follow you"
