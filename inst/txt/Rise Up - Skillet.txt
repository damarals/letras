Skillet

No way, never gonna bow
To your, hate can't pull me under
Stand proud, say it like you mean it
Shout out, your voice is like thunder

Step up the pace and put me away
I'll stay in the game, I'll finish the race
Giving my all, my heart and my soul
You can't control

Love's gonna be a battle cry
So we will

Rise up, rise up
Just like a fire
We will rise again
Rise up, rise up
We got the fire
Burnin' to the end
No fear, no death tonight
We're feelin' so alive
Rise up, rise up
We got the fire
We will rise
We will rise again

Rise up, rise up
We got the fire
Rise up, rise up
We got the fire

Day, night, late at night it's creepin'
Left, right, our fate gets closer
Stand proud, the enemy is knockin'
Scream out, your voice is like thunder

'Cause I believe we are the light
I know who I am, can't take it to me
I will defend, never pretend
I won't give in

Love's gonna be a battle cry
So we will

Rise up, rise up
Just like a fire
We will rise again
Rise up, rise up
We got the fire
Burnin' to the end
No fear, no death tonight
We're feelin' so alive
Rise up, rise up
We got the fire
We will rise
We will rise again

Rise up, rise up
We got the fire
Rise up, rise up
We got the fire

Rise up, rise up
Just like a fire
We will rise again
Rise up, rise up
We got the fire
Burnin' to the end
No fear, no death tonight
We're feelin' so alive
Rise up, rise up
We got the fire
We will rise
We will rise again

Rise up, rise up
We got the fire
Rise up, rise up
We got the fire"
