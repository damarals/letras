"1" "When I Speak Your Name
Kari Jobe

Jesus the most beautiful name of all names
Jesus the only name that brings healing and strength

When I speak Your name
Mountains move chains are loosed
When I speak Your name darkness flees
It has no hold on me
Jesus the most beautiful name that I know
You're the exalted One
Jesus oh You have the power alone
You lift the lowly ones
Jesus

Jesus the most wonderful name of all names
Jesus the only name that brings freedom and hope

Be exalted be exalted
Be exalted higher and higher"
