Vineyard

As we return to You
Stretch out Your hand and heal our brokenness
You saved our lives now come restore us Lord

We're pressing on to know You more
Just like the rising sun You will appear
You saved our lives now come restore us Lord
You saved our lives now come restore us Lord

Rain down, rain down
Come to us like the winter rains [repeat]
Like sweet spring rains"
