"1" "Rockin' With The Best
P.O.D.

Let us begin, what where, why or when
I'll take offense, the pussycats hanging in the lion's den
All [?] second hand versions, a knock off imitation, my echo in the wind
I remember when, when this music meant something
And these rappers weren't fronting but now they all bluffing
All about nothing, no resumes and no dudes
[?] Talking to you
In a bout four seconds [?] I think we need
My philosophy part two and three, so take it from me
All I need is a baseline, feedback from my guitar
I did 'em all with one rhyme

Who rocks the party, that rocks the party
I rock the party, that rocks the party
You rock the party, that rocks the party
(You're now rocking with the best)
Who rocks the party, that rocks the party
I rock the party, that rocks the party
You rock the party, that rocks the party
(You're now rocking with the best)

As good as it gets from past to present tense
Mp3 on iphones to tapes and cassettes
From what's hot now to what's next, no special effects
I'm on another level, too memorable to forget
Poetically phonetic, got you [?] for discussion
My left minded controlling right brain function
Imagination inside beyond the normal music
And I create three dimensional forms
Not to mention one over four, quarter century or more
We've been rocking on tour for your p-pleasure
So la dee da dee, don't mean to be so cocky
But everybody and they mommy know who co rocks the party

Who rocks the party, that rocks the party
I rock the party, that rocks the party
You rock the party, that rocks the party
(You're now rocking with the best)
Who rocks the party, that rocks the party
I rock the party, that rocks the party
You rock the party, that rocks the party
(You're now rocking with the best)

You're now rocking with the best
You're now rocking with the best
You're now rocking with the best
You're now rocking with the best

You're now rocking with the best
You're now rocking with the best
You're now rocking with the best
You're now rocking with the best

Who rocks the party, that rocks the party
I rock the party, that rocks the party
You rock the party, that rocks the party
(You're now rocking with the best)"
