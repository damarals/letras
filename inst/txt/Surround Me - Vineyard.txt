"1" "Surround Me
Vineyard

Surround me, You surround me
I'm lost to everything but You
Cover me, put Your arms of peace around me
And I will love You
Until my last breath and

You are my hope, my will to live
You are my strength, what can I give?

and I'm waiting
and I'm wanting
and I'm needing more of You
and I'm waiting
and I'm needing more of You"
