"1" "Redemption
For Today

I have been in this daily battle long enough
to know its time to bring this to an end.
a call to be pure, to be so clean.
a call for action
I lift my prayers to you father,
bring us to our knees.
Let me hear your voice in this time of need,
and take this lust away from me!

this is your redemption.
this is our freedom!
our freedom, our right,
tonight i make this promise,
to never let lust take over my life.
i know there will be many trials,
and i will be tempted,
but by your grace and your love,
i will defeat this,
and taste the sweet sweet victory,
in you Jesus"
