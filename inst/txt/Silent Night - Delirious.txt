"1" "Silent Night
Delirious

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child

Holy
Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night,
Holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar

Heavenly hosts
Sing Alleluia!
Christ, the Saviour is born
Christ, the Saviour is born
Silent night, holy
Night

Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of
Redeeming grace

Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth"
