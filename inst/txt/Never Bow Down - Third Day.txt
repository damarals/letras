Third Day

Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day

From the recording: Time, Track #4.

Take me from my home
Drag me with the tether
Tell me it's all wrong
The things I've always known
Instill in me all that you think
Will make all of us better
Do just what you want
It matters not to me

I will never bow down
though I know I will be saved from the fire
I will never compromise
All that I have and everything I hold

Call us all around
To show us what you have made
Command us all to fall
When the music starts to play

And everyone from everywhere
Will show you their allegiance
Bu the child of God
Will faithfully stand tall
"
