"1" "Love Is The Final Fight
Dominic Balli

Often the hardest fights go
Night for night through
Rain or shine like war they hold tight
Dawn to dawn stay

We press on
They may run with hatred
But we won't lose sight
Can steel our freedom
Run our kingdoms
Rob us clean of our gold
But they can't take our love within

Even if, even they come with guns
We will not run
Even if even if they come with guns
We will not run
And we shall bound as one
We shall overcome with love

There's a weapon of warfare
Stronger than slaughter
Purges like water
The soul of it's rage
Worth more than diamonds
Stronger than bondage
Murder and carnage
All inferior ways

Through hatred and prejudice
Love is the final fight
Disdain and injustice
Love is the final fight
Bias and bitterness
Love is the final fight
Right love is the final fight"
