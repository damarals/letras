"1" "Let Us Be One
Love Song

Lord, don't let me strive against my brother
I'm so tired of it, don't want to do it no more
Lord, don't let us fight against each other
Let us be one in you
Lord, give us love for one another
In what we say, yes, in what we do
Lord, teach us to build up one another
Let us be one in you
For your sake let us learn to wait on the Spirit's move
We know that the hour is so late and you'll be coming soon
La da da

(Chorus)
Pa pa pa pa pa ra pa pa da da
Pa pa pa pa pa ra pa pa da da da da da da da da pow
Pa pa pa pa pa ra pa pa da da
Let us be one in you (go to ending on second time through)
Let us be one

Lord, let us rest up in your Spirit
Knowing full well that we're in your hands
Oh, God, open up our hearts so we can hear it
Let us be one in you
Let us be one

(Chorus)

Let us be one in you
Let us be one in you
Let us be one in you"
