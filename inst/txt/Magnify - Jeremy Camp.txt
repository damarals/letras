Jeremy Camp

I will open up my heart and sing
For You have lifted up my burdens
And You have made me clean
I have felt the joy of life renewed
Let all I am live to worship
Sovereign king ever with us

Chorus:
We magnify we glorify
You are Holy You are Holy
Every hope will rest in Your faithfulness
Oh how beautiful You are
You are

In the stillness i will hear You speak
Oh the greatness of Your Word
The light unto my feet
Let Your presence overwhelm my soul
Have my heart every moment
Sovereign King ever with us

You are beautiful
You are beautiful
We magnify we glorify
You are Holy You are Holy
Every hope will rest in Your faithfulness
Oh Jesus how beautiful You are
