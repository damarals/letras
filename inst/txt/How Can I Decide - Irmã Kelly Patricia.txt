"1" "How Can I Decide?
Irm√£ Kelly Patricia

Where do you go? How can I decide?
Walking through the road of my life
Sinking in the mud of my sins
I've tried to find joy and peace

Where do you go? How can I decide?
Trying to get all know ledge books and sentences lead me to the edge
Where do you go? How can I decide? Where do you go?

I've tried to find joy and peace. Where do you go?
Living through the will of flesh
I wandered but I found only trash
I've tried to find joy and peace

Where do you go? How can I decide?

Look at the fields, look at the trees, a good tree give us a god gift look want you seed, look want you reap. Only He is the way, truth and life and can give you the joy and the peace do you know who he is? He is Jesus!"
