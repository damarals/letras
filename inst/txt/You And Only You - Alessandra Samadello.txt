"1" "You And Only You
Alessandra Samadello

You, and only You, are the creator
You are the One who reigns above the heavens
Precious is Your name in all the earth
Wonderful is Your power
And all the heavens sing Your grace and glory

You are the Lord, You are the Lord
You are the Lord, You and only You

You and only You, are the redeemer
Our souls behold your grace, your love and glory
Praise the Lord our God, for He is good
Let us give him our hearts
Cause by his pardon we have life

You are the Lord, You are the Lord
You are the Lord, You and only You."
