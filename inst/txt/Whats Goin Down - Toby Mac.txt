"1" "What's Goin' Down
Toby Mac

Welcome to the world of a kid named Mikey
Who had only one reason to be hated by whitey
Raised on a farm outside of South Bend
Where they hated on him cause he was African American
But three years later, Mikey was the town pride
Basketball Mikey went and got himself a bull ride
Earned his acceptance on the hardwood floor
And that's something white America could never ignore

Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's goin' down
Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's goin' down

What's goin' down tell me what's goin' down
You wanna know just what's goin' down
What's goin' down tell me what's goin' down
You wanna know just what's goin' down

Take a look around
Everything is comin' down
Do you hear the subtle sounds
Of our mortality slippin'
People on the go
We'll be reapin' what we sow
Yeah we say we want to know
But I got my suspicions

Welcome to the world of a girl name Susie
Susie's only crime was that she was born a cutie
Physically abused by her uncle and his friends
Alcohol let 'em all leve the house with grins
But Susie couldn't shake off the memories
Forced to find her own kind of remedy
A man-eater for the rest of her days
Three kids, three men, no daddies by eleventh grade

CHORUS

What is goin' diggy down x2
When you find what you lost
But you lose what you found x2
