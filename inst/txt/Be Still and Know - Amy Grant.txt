"x"
"1" "Be Still and Know
Amy Grant

If you made me and you know me
Are you wanting to show me
Who I am and what you made me for
If I turn off the tv
stop chasing the same things
Would I hear You knocking at my door

I know there's more to living life that I see.
And You know I'll find it
in the quiet and believe

Chorus:

You say..
Be still and know that I am God
Be still, be still and know..

Are You waiting and watching
Whispering softly,
underneath the never-ending noise.
I'm not used to listening
But I'm curious wondering
Would I really hear Your voice

You know there's more to living life than what I see
And You know I'll find it
in the quiet and believe"
