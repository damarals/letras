Gracious Tempest
Hillsong United

Your love towers over me
Gracious tempest in the sea
Surround me like a storm

Let your tide of mercy reign
Let it flood in my heart again
Surround me like an ocean

Your love is crashing over me
It's surging like a raging sea
Immerse me in the wonder of your love
A downpour of unending grace
Consuming all my reckless ways
My sins submerged
Your love have saved my soul
Your love is like a storm"
