You Are In Control

(verse 1)
You are my shepherd, I have no needs.
You lead me by peaceful streams,
And You refresh my life.

(verse 2)
You hold my hand, and You guide my steps,
I could walk through the valley of death,
And I won't be afraid.

(chorus)
Because You are in control.
You are in control. You are in control.
You are in control.

(bridge)
You cause everything to work together.
You truly have a sovereign plan.
And You know who I am, and You made who I am,
And You love who I am."
