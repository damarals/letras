Kari Jobe

From the first break of light
To last days
Every echo of time
Every evening face
You always been there

From a baby's first cry
To last breathe
Every fight in our minds
Every victory dance
You've always been there

Ancient One, so amazing
Unfailing You are
Holy One, overwhelming
My heart with Your love

Yahweh, Yahweh
Faithful God You're here to stay
Yahweh, Yahweh
Forever and always the same

Where the sky meets the sea
And breaks free
When compassion and love
Are met with me
You've always been there

Ancient One, so amazing
Unfailing You are
Holy one, overwhelming
My heart with Your love

Yahweh, Yahweh
Faithful God, You're here to stay
Yahweh, Yahweh
Forever and always the same

All consuming
Everlasting
God almighty
Lord of glory"
