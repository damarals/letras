"1" "Everything Good
Gaither Vocal Band

Chorus
Everything good, everything right
Everything holy, everything right
Everything worthy, all that I should
And all is well, ‘cause I'm gonna
Dwell on everything good.

I got a choice, I got a plan
Gonna find the roses under the thorns
Whenever I can.
Lookin' for joy (ooh), Lookin' for love (ooh)
Lookin' for a little bit of Heaven on Earth
Shinning down from above (echo- “from above')

Chorus

Changin' the scene (echo), changin' my way (echo)
Tradin' some gloomy,
Doomy nights for a few more sunny days
It's all in the heart (echo), It's all in the eyes (echo)
So here's how I'm workin' in life,
I've made up my mind

Chorus:
X 2- 2nd time accapello (good, good, good)
X 1- good, good, good, and all is well
‘Cause I'm gonna dwell on everything good"
