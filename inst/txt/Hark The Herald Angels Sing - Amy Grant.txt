"1" "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing
Amy Grant

Hark the herald angels sing \"Glory to the newborn king\"
Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled\"
Joyful all ye nations rise Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim \"Christ is born in Bethlehem\"
With angelic host proclaim \"Christ is born in Bethlehem\"

Mild he lays his glory by, born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth born to give them second birth
Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see; hail the incarnate Diety
Pleased as man with men to dwell, Jesus, our Immanuel
Pleased as man with men to dwell, Jesus, our Immanuel

Hail the heaven born Prince of Peace, Hail the Sun of Righteousness
Light and Life to all he brings, Ris'n healing in his wings
Christ the highest heaven adored, Christ the everlasting Lord
Come desire of nations come, fix in us thy humble home
Come desire of nations come, fix in us thy humble home
