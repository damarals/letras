"1" "Never Give You Up
Amy Grant

There's never been a doubt,
But sometimes I feel afraid.
We need to talk it out;
That always makes it okay.

Sometimes friends don't understand
The love I have for you,
But everywhere I go, I know,
I just want more of you.

I will never give you up, Lord,
Not in a million years.
I will never give you up, never give you up,
Not for as long as I live.
I will never give you up, Lord,
Not in a million years,
'Cause you have put this love inside my heart.

(Oooo-oooh, oooo-oooh, oooo-oooh.)

I know you know me well;
You know the struggle that's in my mind.
But since you hold my heart,
I'll leave the struggles behind.

I don't have to understand
This love I have for you,
'Cause everywhere I go, I know,
I just need more of you.

I will never give you up, Lord,
Not in a million years.
I will never give you up, never give you up,
For as long as I live.
I'm so glad I found you. (So glad I found you.)
Want to build my life around you. (Oooo-oooh.)
Oh, you've got to know
That I'll never let go of you. (Never let go.)

Oh, I will never give you up, Lord,
Not for a million years.
I will never give you up, never give you up,
For as long as I live.
I will never give you up, Lord,
Not for a million years,
'Cause you have put this love inside my heart.

(Never give you up, Lord,)
For a million years.
I will (never give you up, never give you up,)
For as long as I live.
I will (never give you up, Lord,)
For a million years,
'Cause you have put this love inside my heart.

(Never give you up, Lord,)
For a million years.
I will (never give you up, never give you up,)
For as long as I live.
