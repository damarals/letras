"1" "Preparing To Preach
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

Morning comes
Soon we will be
On our way to preach good news
But it's dark outside
And the rain starts to fall
It would be easy to stay inside
Sleepy-eyed

Positive thoughts and preparation
Praying that we'll succeed
This can provide the inspiration
We'll surely need
We're not alone, the angels guide us
Jesus commands them all
And with a loyal friend beside us
We'll never fall

Soon we'll see
Joy come our way
If these things we keep in mind
And Jehovah sees
Ev'ry effort we make
And he remembers the love we show
This we know

Positive thoughts and preparation
Praying that we'll succeed
This can provide the inspiration
We'll surely need
We're not alone, the angels guide us
Jesus commands them all
And with a loyal friend beside us
We'll never fall"
