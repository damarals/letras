Into Your courts I run, with praises flowing from my heart
Everyday I wake, I sing Your song, it's the anthem of my life

I want to spend my days in Your presence, Lord, bowed before Your throne
In the house of God it's where I find my peace
It's where I find my home is Heaven
One day Lord I will live
In Your courts You'll find me, in worship at Your feet
Hide me now, in the shadow of your wings
Where I will be, where I will be

Your love it's all I need
So desperately I have sought Your face
I know You hear my every cry and petition that I make

Jesus
Oh, You are my Treasure"
