"1" "Take A Little Time
Jeremy Camp

I picture all the things that I have seen,
All the broken hearts and tainted memories
All I see are all these needs
I’m tired of my selfish tragedies
It’s time that we show,
The hope that we all know

[CHORUS]
Take just a little time,
To give your hand,
See the world
And take just a little time and try to understand,
That there’s more going on,
Than what these eyes can see

I came across this torn down empty street
How helpless that I felt
A burning urgency
And all I see in front of me,
Are all the faces fading from this vacant scene

[CHORUS]

I know it all seems complicated,
There’s nothing more that could be stated,
Now is the time to kneel,
Reaching out to what is real,
So many times I’ve hesitated,
How much I feel my heart is aching now"
