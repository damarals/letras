"1" "What We Found In The Dark
Dominic Balli

What we think is more isn't always more
We want the sunshine
But sometimes need the storm
Rain falls to rivers
Rivers smooth the stones
Smooth the stones and help the tall trees grow

So remember your doubts
and show proudly your scars
Let the sound of your cries
write a song in your heart
Brother may we never lose the light what we found in the dark
Riches for your soul not an even trade
On the road to comfort you can lose way
No one seeks the gutter but those who find it know
Gutters grow the sweetest rose

Fire burns and in the end is heartbreak
Crushing us to build again
Something better than we were before"
