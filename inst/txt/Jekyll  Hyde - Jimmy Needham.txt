"x"
"1" "Jekyll & Hyde
Jimmy Needham

There is a lunatic in everyone I know
Some live it out
Some just refuse to drink the potion, baby
But we're all monsters inside
Cause we act like Dr. Jekyll
But there ain't no hiding Mr. Hyde

We point the finger
At the fella down the road
\"What kind of devil does a thing like that? \" we joke
Oh baby, just give it time
Cause we act like Dr. Jekyll
But there ain't no hiding Mr. Hyde

Every last one of us
Are pretty much the same
We got ol' Adam's blood
Running through our veins
Oh baby, I ain't telling no lies

It's just some are caught red-handed
And some work up an alibi
Some will probably kill ya
And some just kill ya in their mind
Cause some live in a prison
And some live in a suit and a tie
We act like Dr. Jekyll
but there ain't no hiding Mr. Hyde"
