"1" "Gone Without Goodbye
Brian Littrell

Have you seen my son? Not too tall, 5”8
She held up a color copy photograph from his wedding day
And this is his pregnant wife carrying his last dream
He walked down 46 floors before he felt the rush
The rush of gasoline

I can feel the pain looking in their eyes
But I don’t know gone without goodbye
If I could reach the sky I’d bring it right back to your arms
Though I haven’t seen your son, he’s forever in my life.

And have you seen my little girl?
She’s got curly black hair, she took this raggedy-Anne doll everywhere
Last I saw her over there
Then I heard a choir of screams
And the speeding van
I watched his tears pour down a father’s last attempt
At being a rational man

For I can feel the pain looking into his eyes
But I don’t know gone without goodbye
If I could reach the sky I’d bring her right back to your arms
Though I haven’t seen your girl, she’s forever in my life

And have you seen my faith? It can run and it can hide.
Jesus mend this breaking heart of mine
It keeps our love alive

Oh I can feel the pain look into my eyes
But I don’t know gone without goodbye
If I could reach the sky I’d try to turn the world around
So that we could see the face of forever stay alive
