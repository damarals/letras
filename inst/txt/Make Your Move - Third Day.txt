Third Day

I’m looking around here for some kind of miracle
I’m looking around here for some kind of sign
I gotta believe there’s a rhyme and a reason
For the faith that you find

I gotta admit that there’s something I see in you
I know that it’s something deep inside
But nevertheless, still I can’t help but wonder
Would you really even care if I ever said goodbye

Well, you’ve got love and I’ve got time
Won’t you make a move before I change my mind
And I want to believe it’s true
I’m listening close
Won’t you make your move now

I know that there’s more to life than I’ve ever known
I feel it down deep inside my heart
And I am here now to find what you’re believing
And to know who you are

And if you care to share a minute of your time with me
Tell me now because I am hoping that I can believe
Give me a reason to trust what you’re telling me
Lord knows I need it now, won’t you show me how

Well, you’ve got love and I’ve got time
Won’t you make a move before I change my mind now
And I’ll give you a chance to say
Everything you want before I walk away
Well, I want to believe it’s true
I’m listening close
Won’t you make your move"
