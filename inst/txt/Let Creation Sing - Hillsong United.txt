Hillsong United

The whole earth overflowing, with your power and your glory.
There is no one like you God.
There is no one like you God.
Mountains bow, Nations tremble, at your feet we cry Holy.
There is no one like you God.
There is no one like you God.
Let creation sing of the risen King, Let the universe resound.
With a shout of love, we will give to you, all the highest praise.
Let your light shine upon us, Let your light shine upon us.
For the glory of your name, will be over all the earth. Forever, Forever, I'll Sing."
