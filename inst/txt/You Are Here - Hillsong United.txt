There is a love that I know
Shed for the weak and the broken heart
My shepherd and king
I find you within me
For you are here

Verse 2
Carried the cross for the world
Gathered the lost & the fatherless
My shepherd and king
I find you within me
For you are here
My lord forever

You are here in this place
You are here by your mercy
I draw near in my heart
Take your place you are here

Your word is divine on the earth
Your glory resounds in the universe
My shepherd and king
I find you within me
For you are here
My lord forever

The same power that conquered the grave
Lives in me
Lives in me
Your love that rescued the earth
Lives in me
Lives in me"
