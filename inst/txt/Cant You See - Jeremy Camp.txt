"1" "Can't You See
Jeremy Camp

If He knows every sparrow
that falls from above
Then how much more will
He give you and I his love
to be called into His Hand
and been given all you have

a hope that is eternal
and a future we can grab

and all that I can see
is what His love has done for me

Can't you see what it means to be
The child of One who set you free
Can't you see what it means to be
The child of One who delivered me

You want to have a
purpose just like everyone
You'll be a slave to the world's
choices and not to His Son
The thought if being called
out by our very own name
It's better than all the glory and
better than all the fame

And all that I can see
is what His love has done for me"
