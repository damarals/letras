"1" "Awaken The Song
Vineyard

Awaken the song in me
Rouse my heart to love
Refreshing your song in me
Draw me now to love
Renew passion, restore vision
Awaken the song in me

To sing to you, to dance with you
It is good to be near you my God
To sing to you, to dance with you
It is good to be near you my God

I will sing to you
(repeat)"
