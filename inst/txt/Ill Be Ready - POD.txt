"1" "I'll Be Ready
P.O.D.

I gotta keep on movin'
I see dem comin' down
Hollywood boulevard
And they won't stop
Until dem find me
No time to hide
I just keep ridin' on
I'm ridin'on

When babylon come for I
'jah know I'll be ready
When the wicked man
Come for I
'jah know I'll be ready
When babylon come for I

I'm in the fire
Out here strugglin'
Rollin' down
The sunset strip
Lord it's getting hard
But I'm trying
So please forgive me
But I'm hustlin' on
I'm hustlin' on"
