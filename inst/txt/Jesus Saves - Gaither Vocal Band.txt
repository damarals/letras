"1" "Jesus Saves
Gaither Vocal Band

Jesus saves, He still does
He'll make of you someone new
Cleanse the sin that was.
The Holy Spirit whispers
No more must you be enslaved
Just believe it, Jesus saves.

We talk of Heaven's beauty and that's good
We talk of loving others and we should
But to a dying world the greatest thing that we can say
Is \"Take a look at Calvary, Jesus saves\".

Jesus saves, He still does
He'll make of you someone new
Cleanse the sin that was.
The Holy Spirit whispers
No more must you be enslaved
Just believe it, Jesus saves.

We have heard the joyful sound
Jesus saves, Jesus saves
Spread the tidings all around
Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

Jesus saves, He still does
He'll make of you someone new
Cleanse the sin that was.
The Holy Spirit whispers
No more must you be enslaved
Just believe it, Jesus saves.

Jesus saves, He still does
He'll make of you someone new
Cleanse the sin that was.
The Holy Spirit whispers
No more must you be enslaved
Just believe it, Jesus saves.

The Holy Spirit whispers
No more must you be enslaved
Just believe it,
Just believe it,
Just believe it, Jesus saves."
