Youthful Praise

I feel the presence, of the Lord
I feel the presence, of the Lord, in the room
In the room
(Repeat)

So we lift our hands
Lift our hands
So we lift our hands
Lift our hands

I feel the glory, of the Lord
I feel the glory, of the Lord, in the room
In the room
(Repeat)

So we lift our hands
Lift our hands
So we lift our hands
Lift our hands
