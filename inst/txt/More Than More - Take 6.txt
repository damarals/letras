I need you
I need you

One, two, or, three…
Maybe a hundred times, she’d say a thousand times
That my insecurity was showing out over and over again
And the problem wasn’t her (it was me)
And the fact that i never trusted you
And i know that must have disgusted you
But i had to hurt ‘til i learned

More than ever…
After what i been through
All i really know is that i need you
More than ever…
Standing here in the rubble
I know that i’m in trouble
I need you more than ever (never ever)

(never) do it again… but i did it again
And i’m standing right here in this place again
Hoping that you would forgive my sin…
I don’t really care ‘bout the bridges i had to burn
I just chalk them up as lessons i had to learn…there’s
One thing, that’s pretty clear to me
With you i have all things without you i have nothing

More than ever…
After what i been through
All i really know is that i need you
More than ever…
Standing here in the rubble
I know that i’m in trouble
I need you more than ever (never ever)

Just like oceans need a shoreline
So they won’t just spill away
Just like the moonlight needs the sunrise
So the night can turn to day
Just like the flowers need the showers
So their beauty won’t decay

That’s how i feel you
That’s how i want you
That’s how i need your love… today

More than ever…
After what i been through
All i really know is that i need you
More than ever…
Standing here in the rubble
I know that i’m in trouble
I need you more than ever (never ever)"
