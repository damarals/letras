"1" "His Love
Hillsong United

Your light is over me, Flooding over me, the night is lifted.
Heaven over me, flooding over me, I can't contain it, my cup overflows, my cup overflows.
Praise the Lord with all my heart, Praise Him for he has done great things.
His banner over me is love, His love.
His banner over me is love, His love.
You brought the sunshine in, and turned the dark to day, You made the shadows flee away.
You opened up my eyes, to a new and living way, the dawning of a brand new day."
