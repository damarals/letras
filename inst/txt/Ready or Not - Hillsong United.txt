Hillsong United

Come now
As you are
Or as you want to be are
you ready
Are you ready

Come now
Tired broken
Scared or just in need
Ready or not
It's alright
Take your time
If nothing else
just come
Are you ready
Are you ready

Come now
Bring your hopes
Your dreams
Your doubts
Your scars
Are you ready
Are you ready

Come now
Bring your hurts
Your fears
Your faith
Your heart
Are you ready
Are you ready or not

There's no place like His presence
There's no time like the now
Every one two or three of us
Count Him in here and now
He welcomes the broken
He's alright with your past
He's not mad at any one of us
But He waits with open arms
Says come

Are you ready
Are you ready

Come now
Leave your inhibitions
At the door
Are you ready
Are you ready

Come now
Lay your burdens down
He's got them all
Are you ready
Are you ready or not

He's still faithful to deliver
Mighty as ever to save
He's still good on His promises
And His love still never fails
He's not moved by perfection
Or how well we look the part
But He's wild about the hidden stuff
Like He's wild about the heart

Come now
For all we've seen
We ain't seen nothing yet
Are you ready
Are you ready

Come now
Bring Him praise
For what He might do next
Are you ready
Are you ready or not

He's already bought our freedom
He's already paid our debt
He's already done the miracle
He's already conquered death

He's our light and salvation
He's our rock solid hope
He's already done enough for us
He's already doing more

He's already seen the ending
He's already seen us move
He's already breaking out of us
He's already on the moon

He's already won our battles
He's already paved the way
He's already gone ahead of us
And He is ready when we are

Come now
For all we've seen
We've ain't seen nothing yet
Are you ready
Are you ready

Come now
Bring Him praise
For what He's gonna do next
Are you ready
Are you ready or not
Come"
