Verse 1:

I’m alive to bring glory to You, King
God of victory, You are my passion
It’s in the way You are, You don’t change at all
Great and humble God, You are my passion

Pre-chorus:

My strength in life is I am Yours
My soul delights because I am Yours

Your will on earth is all I’m living for

Chorus:

Jesus, I glorify; Jesus, my love is Yours
You are my heart’s desire; I live to know You more

Verse 2:

Light that breaks the darkness, showing what true love is
Always full of goodness, You are my passion
You never do me wrong, the meekest Man, but strong
The most perfect song, You are my passion"
