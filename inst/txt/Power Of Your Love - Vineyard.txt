Vineyard

Verse 1:

Lord I come to You
Let my heart be changed
Renewed
Flowing from the grace
that I found in You.

Lord I've come to see
the weaknesses in me
will be stripped away
by the pow'r Your love.

Chorus:

Hold me close
let Your love surround me
bring me near
draw me to your side
and as I wait
I'll rise up like the eagle
and I will sore with You
Your spirit leads me on
by the power of Your love.

Verse 2:

Lord unveal my eyes
let me see You face to face
the knowledge of Your love
as you live in me.

Lord renew my mind
as Your will unfolds in my life
in living everyday
by the power of Your love.

Repeat Chorus"
