"x"
"1" "No Ordinary Love
Toby Mac

Momma never said it would be like this
I never knew such bliss existed
Or maybe it’s just so indescribable
Love was liable to get her twisted
She never told me but if she tried I was a little too young it floated right by me
I never dreamed love so fulfilling it’s simply killing and over spilling on me
It goes on and on …

This ain’t no ordinary love
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun

I refuse to believe we’re a dying breed
Children of peace hope and harmony
Ordinary folks extraordinary love
Something from above
Something we fall short of
You can’t see with an untrained eye
But if you take a little time you are sure to find it
We complicate something so basic
But once you taste it you gonna chase it like me
It goes on and on …

A - yo here we go, open up the gates and let it flow …
Love’s gonna take us higher

This ain’t no ordinary love
It’s extraordinary love"
