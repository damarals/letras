What can I do with my obsession?
With the things I cannot see
Is there madness in my being?
Is it wind that blows the trees?

Sometimes You're further than the moon
Sometimes You're closer than my skin
And You surround me like a winter fog
You've come and burned me with a kiss

And my heart burns for You
And my heart burns

What can I do with my obsession?
With the things I cannot see
Is there madness in my being?
Is it wind that blows the trees?

Sometimes You're further than the moon
Sometimes You're closer than my skin
And You surround me like a winter fog
You've come and burned me with a kiss

And my heart burns for You (2x)
And my heart burns, it burns for You (6x)
It burns for You

And oh, forever
Keep me burning, keep me burning
With the fire of Your love

And my heart burns for You (2x)
And my heart burns, it burns for You (6x)
It burns for You

\"Lift your voice
Our hearts burn for You, Lord
You're our obsession, God
You're our desire, God
Lift your voice
Tell Him in your own words
God, You alone, You alone
You alone hold our affection, God\""
