"1" "Lean On Me
Fernanda Brum

If your eyes
Are set eyes
And your soul
Is wounded, owow
What can you do?
If you're lost
Alone
A free slave
Captive
Exiled of a broken heart
Don't stay like this!
I give you forgiveness
But your voice I do wanna hear

Lean on me
Wherever you are
If you claim with your faith
I'll sure hear you from the sky
Lean on me
Wherever you are
If you claim with your faith
I'll sure open the sky
Over you

If your eyes
Are set eyes
And your soul
Is wounded, owow
What can you do?
If you're lost
Alone
A free slave
Captive
Exiled of a broken heart
Don't stay like this!
I give you forgiveness
But your voice I do wanna hear

Lean on me
Wherever you are
If you claim with your faith
I'll sure hear you from the sky
Lean on me
Wherever you are
If you claim with your faith
I'll sure open the sky
Over you
You

Lean on me!
Hear from the sky! wow
Wherever you are
Hey... I'll sure hear you from the sky
Lean on me
Ohh
Lean on me!"
