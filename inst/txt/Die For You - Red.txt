"1" "Die For You
Red

I know you hate me
I never meant to make you feel this
I feel so betrayed
I never though i could feel condemmend
I never though i could feel all you sin

Oh, i can feel your madness now
Oh, i can feel your fire now
It's what i burn for
It's what i bleed for
I would die for you
You know I'd die for you

I feel exposed, i feel disgraced
I feel a whole new kind of hate
Someone please tell me
What i'm supposed to do
'cause you hate me but i love you

Oh, i can feel your madness now
Oh, i can feel your fire now
It's what i burn for
It's what i ache for
It's what i bleed for
I would die for you
You know i'd die for you
Oh, i can feel your madness now
Oh, i can feel your fire now
It's why i'm breaking down
I'm coming back around
And now i'm telling you
You know i'd die for you


I know you love me
You known i wish i didn't feel this way
I ain't gonna change


Oh, i can feel your madness now
Oh, i can feel your fire now
It's what i burn for
It's what i ache for
It's what i bleed for
I would die for you
You know i'd die for you
Oh, i can feel your bitter eyes
Oh, i can feel your fire now
It's why i'm breaking down
I'm coming back around
And now i'm telling you
You know i'd die for you"
