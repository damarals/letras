Vineyard

I come into Your presence
All I have I give to You
Your glory lls my senses
Oh my Lord I bow before You

My God, my King
You are my everything
I worship and adore Your holy name
My God, my King
You are my everything
I worship and adore Your holy name

As I gaze upon Your beauty
I want to reach out and touch Your face
I want to stay here forever
Cause me to never, ever leave this place"
