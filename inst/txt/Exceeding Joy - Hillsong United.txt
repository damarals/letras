"1" "Exceeding Joy
Hillsong United

I have found exceeding joy
Jesus answered when I called this name
That has saved me
Pure love that embraced me
Mercy, grace, eternal life
Brought from darkness to His light
While lost in my sin
He raised me and made me live

My soul magnifies the Lord
My heart joys in God my Saviour
For He lifts the lowly
Heâ€™s done great things for me
I will sing, praising evermore
He is Mighty and Holy is His name

I will lift my head up high
Praising Jesus through each trial
Though I have not seen Him
I love Him completely"
