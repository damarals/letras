"1" "Come On Back To Me
Third Day

You've been hiding now for so long
Never understanding why
Running far away from the truth
And all along chasing after lies

I have loved you from the beginning
Long before you knew my name
Even though you've broken my heart
I'll love you just the same
I'll love you anyway

Never mind your worries
Never mind your fears
They can only take you far from me
When you feel ther's nowhere
Left for you to turn
Well, i got all you want
And everything you need
Come on back to me

Do belive in second chances?
Or in a love that never fades?
Put your faith in what you can't see
Just put your hand in mine
And i'll show you the way"
