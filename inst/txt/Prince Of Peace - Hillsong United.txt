"1" "Prince Of Peace
Hillsong United

My heart a storm
Clouds raging deep within
The Prince of Peace came bursting through the wind
The violent sky held its breath
And in Your light I found rest

Tearing through the night, riding on the storm
Staring down the fight, my eyes found Yours
Shining like the sun, striding through my fear
The Prince of Peace met me there

You heard my prayer

Hope like the sun
Light piercing through the dark
The Prince of Peace came, broke into my heart

The violent cross, the empty grave
And in Your light I found grace

Tearing through the night, riding on the storm
Staring down the fight, my eyes found Yours
Shining like the sun, striding through my fear
The Prince of Peace met me there

You're always there
And you hear my prayer

Your love surrounds me
When my thoughts wage war
When night screams terror
There Your voice will roar
Come death or shadow
God I know Your light will meet me there

When fear comes knocking
There You'll be my guide
When day breeds trouble
There You hold my heart
Come storm or battle
God I know Your peace will meet me there

Again and again

Oh, be still my heart
Know that You are God
Oh fear no evil
For I know You are here

And my soul will know

Your love surrounds me
When my thoughts wage war
When night screams terror
There Your voice will roar
Come death or shadow
God I know Your light will meet me there

And my soul will know

When fear comes knocking
There You'll be my guide
When day breeds trouble
There You hold my heart
Come storm or battle
God I know Your peace will meet me there

Oh, be still my heart
My soul will ever know that You are God
And You heard my prayer"
