Third Day

Lyrics & Music by Mac Powell

From the recording: Third Day, Track #1.

On and On... she goes
Where she stops no one really knows
Everybody's got a problem so it seems and
She ain't afraid of tellin' me
If you can't say nothin' good, don't say nothin' at all

On and On...he goes
Now look who's playin' the fool
Criticizing, telling lies, putting down
ain't you got nothin' better to do?
If you can't say nothin' good, don't say nothin' at all

Chorus:
'Cause I know that there are times in life
When we just can't keep it to ourselves
but to want is not to make it right
We've got to tame our tongue
If you can't say nothin' good, don't say nothin' at all

On and on...we go
playin the game that never ends
I think it's time that we all realize
a broken heart is hard to mend
If you can't say nothin' good don't say nothin' at all

James 3:5-10

Repeat Chorus
