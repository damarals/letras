"1" "What They Say
Britt Nicole

People around the world are tryin' to bring me down
Everybody's lookin' for me to all
But I don't have to worry 'bout what those people say
I'll keep my eyes fixed on him, be strong, I'm not alone

I'll set my eyes upon the one who set me free
(They'll be no quit!)
They'll be no fall
My God is there to rescue me
I won't take lightly all the blood he shed for me
No way, no way

Even when it seems like all your hope is gone
Don't you rest until all his work is done
You gotta fall on your knees, sacrifice everything
You gotta get your eyes fixed on him
Be strong, you're not alone

I'll set my eyes upon the one who set me free
(They'll be no quit!)
They'll be no fall
My God is there to rescue me
I won't take lightly all the blood he shed for me
No way, no way

It doesn't matter what they say
I'm gonna make it all the way
And his love will never leave or fade away
Trust him now and stay on track
Take his hand and don't look back
Cuz the world don't satisfy"
