"x"
"1" "Hurricane
Jimmy Needham

I have built this city here,
half with pride and half with fear,
I just wanted a safer place to hide,
I don't wanna be safe tonight.

(Chorus)
I need you like a hurricane,
thunder crashing wind and rain,
to tear my walls down,
I'm only yours now.
I need you like a burning flame,
wild fire untamed,
to burn these walls down,
I'm only yours now,
I'm only yours now.

I am yours and you are mine,
You know far better than I,
And if disstruction whats I need,
Then I'll recieve it Lord from Thee,
Yes, I'll recieve it Lord from Thee.

(Chorus)

And it's your eye in the storm,
Watching over me,
And its your eye in the storm,
Wanting only good for me,
And if you are the wall,
And beat of casualty,
Then I am yours, Lord I'm only yours,
I am yours and more.

(Chorus)"
