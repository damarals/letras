"1" "Out From Under
Red

Knocked off my feet
The earth moved beneath
The edge of a dream and a nightmare

Open the door
Fell through the floor
Slipped through the cracks into nowhere

So tell me where were you
When everything fell down like thunder
I begged you to pull me through
I couldn’t get out from under

I took the fall
I took it all
Last night was just an illusion

Cut me, I bleed
Feel me in need
I finally broke in the pressure

So tell me where were you
When everything fell down like thunder
I begged you to pull me through
I couldn’t get out from under

Left me for dead inside my head
Couldn’t you see that I was still breathing?
Screaming, I reached for you
I couldn’t get out from under

Where were you?
I reached for you
The pressure broke me down

Where were you?
I reached for you
The pressure broke me

Where were you?
The pressure broke me
Where were you?
The pressure broke me
Where were you?
I reached for you"
