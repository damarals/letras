"1" "Look What Has Happened To Me
Amy Grant

In the morning when I wake,
And my feet can find the floor,
I stumble down the hall,
And I open up the door,
Then I look into the mirror,
Just like I know you do.
Stopping for a moment,
I can feel my mind go through,
The bound'ries of time,
Back to a heart without His
Love inside.
I was more than just alone;
I was dying on my own,
Thinking that nothing was ever gonna
Save my life.

Look what has happened to me,
I find it hard to believe.
His love has taken my life
This far, so far....
Looking what has happened to me,
My mind can hardly conceive
What I'm beginning to be,
Look what, look what....

When you stop and think it over,
Do you think you're doing well?
Are you getting stronger?
Can you really tell?
If you're truthful with your feelings,
Then you see there's room to grow,
Though you may have found the answer,
There is so much more to know....

More to this life.
You can never stop growing, or you'll
Start to die.
I can not survive alone.
I am nothing on my own.
But seeing's believing, and if you
Need to see,
Look at me.

Ahhhh....

Look what has happened to me,
I find it hard to believe.
His love has taken my life
This far, so far....
Look what has happened to me,
My mind can hardly conceive.
Look what has happened,
Look what, look what....

Look what has happened to me,
I find it hard to believe.
His love has taken my life
This far, so far....
Look what has happened to me,
My mind can hardly conceive
What I'm beginning to be,
Look what, look what....

Look what has happened to me, (Look what has happened to me,)
I find it hard to believe.
His love has taken my life
This far, so far....
Look what has happened to me,
My mind can hardly conceive
What I'm beginning to be,
Look what, look what....
