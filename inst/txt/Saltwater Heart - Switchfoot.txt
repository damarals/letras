"x"
"1" "Saltwater Heart
Switchfoot

Talking to myself in a land locked parking lot
Cough drop dripping from my mouth like a long shot
My writers block ink, oh

Sick of all the small talk dripping non-stop
From the open mouth graves of the faux-hawk cinderblock malls
My blood clot pen, oh

Or maybe I could break clean
Yeah maybe I could break clean

When I'm on your shore again
I can feel the ocean
I can feel your open arms
That pure emotion

I'm finally free again
Like my own explosion
When I'm on your shore again
I can feel the ocean

Saltwater running through my veins like a blind spot
Like I got caught, saltwater like a tear drop
With a saltwater heart, oh

It's an abstract thought but I've been thinking non-stop
About the fact that my body's made most out of rain drops
With a saltwater heart, oh

Or maybe I could wash clean
Yeah maybe I could believe

When I'm on your shore again
I can feel the ocean
I can feel your open arms
That pure emotion

I'm finally free again
Like my own explosion
When I'm on your shore again
I can feel the ocean

Oh, Oh, Oh

Maybe I could wash clean
Maybe I could wash clean
All land locked dreams
Maybe I could believe

When I'm on your shore again
I can feel the ocean
I can feel your open arms
That pure emotion

I'm finally free again
Like my own explosion
When I'm on your shore again
I can feel the ocean

Yeah, Oh, Oh, Oh
I can feel the ocean"
