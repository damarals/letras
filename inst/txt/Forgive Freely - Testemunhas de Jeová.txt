"1" "Forgive Freely
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

I've got this grudge, I'm holding it in
But it's so heavy, it pulls me down
I wish I could turn this around
I understand the need to forgive
But it's not easy if it's not my fault
These thoughts bring forgiveness to a halt

It's right about now that I have to pray
Jehovah saw what happened; he knows my pain
But most of all, he gives me

Strength to let it go
No, I can't do this on my own
I pray: Jehovah, please help me
Help me forgive freely

He'll help me to reflect
The way he forgives, the way he forgets
I pray: Jehovah, please help me
Help me forgive freely
Forgive freely

Trying my best to let it all go
But at times, it comes back to mind
I wish I could put all this behind
I realize that I can't hold on
Forgiveness means you don't bring it back up
This only gets me in a rut

It's right about now that I have to pray
Jehovah saw what happened; he knows my pain
But most of all, he gives me

Strength to let it go
No, I can't do this on my own
I pray: Jehovah, please help me
Help me forgive freely

He'll help me to reflect
The way he forgives, the way he forgets
I pray: Jehovah, please help me
Help me forgive freely
Forgive freely
Forgive freely
Forgive freely
Forgive freely"
