Testemunhas de Jeov√°

There is a way of peace
The way you've come to know
It is the way you learned
The way of long ago
The way that Jesus taught you
When his voice you heard

This is the way of peace
Found in jehovah's word
This is the way to life; this is the way
Don't look aside; not for a moment stray!
God's voice is calling: 'this is the way
Do not look back, for yes, this is the way. '

There is a way of love
No need to look around
God's voice has shown the way
He lets himself be found
His love is full and good
His love is warm and true
This is the way of love
It touches all we do
This is the way to life; this is the way
Don't look aside; not for a moment stray!
God's voice is calling: 'this is the way
Do not look back, for yes, this is the way. '

There is a way of life
No need to look behind
Our God has promised us
No better way we'll find
No higher way to peace
No finer way to love

This is the way to life
Thanks to our God above
This is the way to life; this is the way
Don't look aside; not for a moment stray!
God's voice is calling: 'this is the way
Do not look back, for yes, this is the way"
