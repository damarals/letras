Third Day

Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day

From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #10.

I need to be someone who's a lot like you
Easy to see that I sure need something new
Though I try to live life my way
I think it goes to prove
That I need to be someone who's like you

And I know that you want to change me
Want to rearrange the way I feel inside
Yes, I've heard that you take
The broken hearts of lonely souls
And you make all things right

Do you know who I am?
Have you seen the things I've done?

Never before, no there's never been a time
That I would implore you to take what's yours and mine
And to use it in the way you will
In any way you find
Never before did I realize"
