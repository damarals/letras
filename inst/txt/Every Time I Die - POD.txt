P.O.D.

Your expressions speak louder than words
And I can tell right now that you've got a lot to say
So get it off your chest, cause I'm listening
And show me who I am, so I can change
We'll never change if our thinking stays the same

I like it when you smile
I need to feel you smile
I love to see you smile
Smile like that for me!

And I can see you smile, glowing on your face
And Every Time I Die, you take it all away
Your lookin in my eyes, there's nothing left to say
And Every Time I Die, you take it all away

Without hissing threats, It cuts to the bone
And it shows me the things, I think I already know
But sometimes I don't like the way it makes me feel
And even if you got it, I only want it if it's real
Cause it reminds me when I'm not listening
It doesn't matter to the things that matter the most

I like it when you smile
I need to feel you smile
I love to see you smile
Smile like that for me!

And I can see you smile, glowing on your face
And Every Time I Die, you take it all away
Your lookin in my eyes, there's nothing left to say
And Every Time I Die, you take it all away

I like it when you smile
I need to feel you smile
I love to see you smile
Smile like that for me!

And I can see you smile, glowing on your face
And Every Time I Die, you take it all away
Lookin in my eyes, nothing left to say
And Every Time I Die, you take it all away

And I can see you smile, glowing on your face
And Every Time I Die, you take it all away
Lookin in my eyes, nothing left to say
And Every Time I Die, you take it all away"
