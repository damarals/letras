(Additional lyrics adapted from the song, \"Angels We Have Heard on High\")
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the pains
And the mountains in reply
Echo back their joyous strains
Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo

Come to Bethlehem and see
(Gloria O sing Gloria)
Him whose birth the angels sing
(Gloria O sing Gloria)
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King

Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo

Angels we have heard on high
(Gloria O sing Gloria)
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
(Gloria O sing Gloria)
Jesus Lord of heav'n and earth
With us sing our Savior's birth

Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo

Alleluia
"
