Kirk Franklin

(feat. Rance Allen and Isaac Carree)

[Verse 1: Kirk Franklin]
Little boy where you goin?
Tell me what ya gon do, ya gon be
Tell me what ya future
Is college in ya dreams?
You like that money and dem shiny things
Got shot at 17 (Lord)
At ya funeral we sing a sad song (sad song)
Ya mama's baby's gone
I hear the preacher say rest in peace little boy

[Verse 2: Kirk Franklin]
Little girl where you goin?
Do you even know, you to young for dem clothes?
I know you think you grown, but let him see your mind, not the crack of your behind
Baby take your time, and realize, tomorrow has trouble of it's own
Oh, and one mo thing, you deserve a king cause you a queen baby girl

[Section: Isaac Carree]
What happened to the days, when we knew the way, and we used to say Jesus
Now everything is gray, when trouble comes we pray
Somethings gotta change

[Chorus: Rance Allen]
I've seen the lightning flashing
And I heard... I heard the thunder roll (yes it did Lord)
See it won't be long, God's showing up our wrong
Get right church, before it's time to go home

[Verse 3: Kirk Franklin]
Mama, daddy what ya doin?
Ain't took a trip in years
Busy with both ya careers
Trying to make a mark
Even bought a house, but ya kids live at 106 && park
It's getting dark
Don't let the sun go down, now your children ain't around for ya (ain't around for ya)
Ain't no money in the world worth you losing family
Just tryin to help ya see baby

[Section]

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Rance Allen and Isaac Carree]
If we ever needed the Lord before, we sho do need him now

[Verse 4: Kirk Franklin]
Preacherman where we goin?
Church what does it mean
A talent show or lottery?
I know I've been guilty
It starts inside of me
Together we can make a change
And one mo thing
When you judge his name, be careful the preacher ain't your God (ain't your God)
See his job is to give people Jesus baby, Jesus baby"
