"x"
"1" "Smile
André Valadão

Never give up on life
Everything is possible for him who believes
There is always a way out
God has not forgotten about you (2x)
Smile no further why cry
The storm has calmed down
Look at the sky outside and see the day that came
It's much better, there is nothing to fear.
Life teaches us and still has much to learn.
This is the sign does not feel alone
There is someone cheering you on.
Ascend this light
Decide if you see with eyes that God looks at you.

Never give up on life

Never give up on life
Everything is possible for him who believes
There is always a way out
God has not forgotten you (3x)
Never give up on life
Everything is possible for him who believes
There is always a way out"
