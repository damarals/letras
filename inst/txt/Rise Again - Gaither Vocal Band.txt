"1" "Rise Again
Gaither Vocal Band

Go ahead, drive the nails in my hands,
Laugh at me where you stand.
Go ahead, and say it isn’t me,
The day will come when you will see.

Chorus
‘Cause I’ll rise again,
There’s no power on earth that tie me down.
Yes, I’ll rise again,
Death can’t keep me in the ground.


Go ahead and mock my name,
My love for you is still the same.
Go ahead and bury me,
But very soon I will be free.

Chorus

Go ahead and say I’m dead and gone,
But you will see you were wrong.
Go ahead, try to hide the Son,
But all will see that I’m the One.

Chorus"
