"1" "Before You
Vineyard

Is there any forgiveness
For the things I've done
Is there pardon for sinners
I know that I'm one
Before You, before You

Would You take this heart of foulness
And make it clean again
Would You pour on me Your mercy
As I confess my sin
Before You, before You

(chorus)
Point my feet
In the way they should go
Place Your Holy Spirit in me
Lead me in the ways everlasting
I long to have a heart that's pure
Before You, before You"
