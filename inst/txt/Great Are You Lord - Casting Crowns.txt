"1" "Great Are You Lord
Casting Crowns

You give life, you are love
You bring light to the darkness
You give hope, you restore
Every heart that is broken

Great are you, lord

It's your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
We pour out our praise
It's your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
To you only

You give life, you are love
You bring light to the darkness
You give hope, you restore
Every heart that is broken

Great are you, lord
It's your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
We pour out our praise
It's your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
To you only

All the earth will shout
Your praise
Our hearts will cry
These bones will sing
Great are you, lord

It's your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
We pour out our praise
It's your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
To you only"
