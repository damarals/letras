"x"
"1" "Burden Me
Jeremy Camp

All the people that I see
How they search so desperately
It's all I want, all I need, is for you to give to me
A heart for those who need to know how much you care
Well I can see your burden coming everyday, searching for the answer
I just need you to

Chorus
Burden me with the weight that you love me
Burden me with your plan
Burden me with the message that you've given me
Burden me here I am

Well the purpose within me
How it burns so fervently
It's all I want, all I need, is for you to give to me
A heart for those who need to know how much you care
Well I can see your burden coming everyday, searching for the answer
I just need you to

Chorus (x3)

Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I am
Here I am here I am, here I am"
