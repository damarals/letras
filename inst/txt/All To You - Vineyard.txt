"1" "All To You
Vineyard

When it's all said and done
And Your word has spoken
My heart is touched by Your love
When Your mercy flows like streams
I bow
My heart surrenders and I give my life
Lord I surrender and I give my life

I'm giving all
(Lord I surrender and I give my life)
All to You
(Lord I surrender and I give my heart)
I'm giving all
(I feel my burdens lifting as I bow)
All to You
(Lord I surrender and I give my life)"
