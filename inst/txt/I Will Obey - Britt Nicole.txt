"1" "I Will Obey
Britt Nicole

Many times I could not pray
But smiling down I heard you say
Just take my hand I'll lead the way
I will obey
In the night I remember your name
I hear your voice, I hear your voice
You speak to me
It's a voice that I can't not deny
Calling me forth and I will obey

Lord, keep me broken to the words you have spoken
Here's my life, I lift my hands in praise
I will obey
In the night I remember your name
I hear your voice, I hear your voice
You speak to me
It's a voice that I can't not deny
Calling me forth and I will obey

I have sought you, lord, with all my heart
Be gracious unto me
I've considered my ways and I turn my steps to you
My hopes and my dreams are in your sweet word
Your promises are true
Let this lamp be my light
And I'll do what you want me to do

I will obey
In the night I remember your name
I hear your voice, I hear your voice
You speak to me
It's a voice that I can't not deny
Calling me forth and I will obey"
