"1" "Zion Mourns
Dominic Balli

On the rocky road where all the streets are worn
While her daughter slaves the road to Zion mourns
The road to Zion mourns
She calls but no one come
While her daughter slaves the road to Zion

In Babylon by the river banks
We hung our song we hung our name
While Zion calls, she calls us home
But no one hears, her voice is gone

In Babylon where our captors sat
Said, \"Tell us of Zion and sing us her song\"
How can we sing the Almighty's song in a foreign land where we have no song

Generations passed not a seed was sewn
A hope was lost with a daughter's song
Till the Most High called and sang his song
Called a princess home to her rightful throne

On the rocky road where all the streets were worn
While her daughter slaved the road to Zion mourned
The road to Zion mourned / She calls but no one come
While her daughter enslaved the road to Zion mourned
Still on that rocky road where all the streets are worn
She fights to"
