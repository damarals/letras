"1" "Save me From Myself
Oficina G3

Lost
My heart is hard as stone
On my own, alone, I carry it home

Gone
I used to waste the days
So distraught
I thought
I'm changing my ways

Now you're changing my ways

You save me
Save me from myself
There is no one else
I'd lean on
Save me
You save me from myself
There is no one else to set me free

Start
The start of something new
Is what I find
When I'm just looking at you
Lift
You lift me off the ground
Keep holding my hand
I won't land
Won't even look down

Don't look down!
Don't look down!

You save me
Save me from myself
There is no one else
I'd lean on
Save me
You save me from myself
There is no one else to set me free"
