Hillsong United

So many things I realise that I can't live without
so many things that I despise until i live them out
there's so many reasons in my brokeness you see
to lose my life and that a searvent be my king

I've been crucified with Christ
and I no longer live, Jesus forever is in me

So many word that never say the way I really feel
so many ways to live a life to me i love you real
and there's so many times i know i chose to die to me
to magnify the one who's died to make me free
