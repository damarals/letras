Newsboys

When did it become breaking a rule
To say your name out loud in school
When your name's the only one that sets us free
When did it become incorrect
To speak the truth about life and death
When your life gave us all eternity

Even if it gets me convicted
I'll be on my knees with my hands lifted

If serving you is against the law of man
If living out my faith in you is banned
Then I'll stand right before the jury

If saying I believe is out of line
If I'm judged cause I'm gonna give my life
To show the world the love that fills me
Then I wanna be guilty

I'll rise up and honor you
I'll testify to the good you do
Cause your grace and your mercy have overtaken me

So even if it gets me convicted
I'll be on my knees with my hands lifted

If serving you is against the law of man
If living out my faith in you is banned
Then I'll stand right before the jury

If saying I believe is out of line
If I'm judged cause I'm gonna give my life
To show the world the love that fills me
Then I wanna be

Guilty by association
Guilty of being a voice proclaiming your ways
Your truth
Your life
I'll pay the price to be your light"
