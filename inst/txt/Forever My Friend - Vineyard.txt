"1" "Forever My Friend
Vineyard

No one can love me the way that You do
No one as faithful and true
You never leave me though I've been untrue
I am so thankful I have a friend like You

And I love You, I love You
My Jesus, my friend
I love You
For now and forever
Your love never fails me
You're true to the end
Oh Lord, You are forever my friend"
