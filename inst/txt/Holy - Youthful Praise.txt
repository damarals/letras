Verse:
The ground you walk upon is holy,
all creation cries, \"holy\".
The Cherubim and the Seraphim,
cry, \"holy, holy\".

Bridge:
All were created for Thy pleasure,
even I was created for Thy pleasure
to bring You glory, to bring You honor,
to show Your wisdom, to show Your power.

Holy, Lord, God,
oh, none like Thee.
Holy is the Lord.

Vamp:
Lord, let our praises be a sweet smelling fragrance,
let us have the privilege to worship Thy holiness."
