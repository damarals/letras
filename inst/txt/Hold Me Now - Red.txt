"1" "Hold Me Now
Red

Fall asleep to dream of home
Where the waves are crashing
The only place I've ever known
Now the future has me

I see the fire in the sky
See it all around me
I said the past is dead
The life I had is gone
Said won't give up
Until I see the sun

Hold me now
'Til the fear is leaving
I am barely breathing

Waking up and letting go
To the sound of angels
Am I alive or just a ghost?
Haunted by my sorrows
Hope is slipping throug my hands
Gravity is taking hold

I said I'm not afraid
That I'm brave enough
I will not give up
Until I see the sun

Hold me now
'Til the fear is leaving
I am barely breathing
Crying out
These tired wings are falling
I need you to catch me

As I burn
As I break
I can't take it anymore
I return to the place where
The water covers over everything
Rescue me somehow

Hold me now
'Til the fear is leaving
I'm barely breathing
Crying out
These tired wings are falling
I need you to catch me

Hold me now
'til the fear is leaving
I am barely breathing"
