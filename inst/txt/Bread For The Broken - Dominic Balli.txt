"1" "Bread For The Broken
Dominic Balli

I see children in the night
Twenty million as they reach for hope
No one look, no one cry
No one cares, so no one try
I see children in the night

Chorus:
We need bread for the broken
We need bread for the broken
Give some hope to the hopeless
Give some hope to the hopeless, hopeless
Bread for the broken, broken

I see daughters in the fields
She sell her body for a dollar bill
No one look, no one cry
No one care, so no one try
I see children in the night

Chorus:

I cannot live my life daily knowin I am connected to you
So what am I to do
If I was in your shoes I hope and pray that someone reach out to me and pull me from my blues
So won't you grab my hand baby, let me pull you to me
Let me see what I can do so you can be free
Let me grab your hand brother, let me help you now
Take this love from my heart and put this food in your mouth
And let me paint a picture of freedom
Let me paint the picture of healing
Let me paint the picture of humans through our lovin and given
We need bread"
