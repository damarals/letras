Jeremy Camp

It seemed like an ordinary night
But we've never seen stars shining so bright
There's something about this star
Even though it seems so far
Hallelu
Hallelujah

Behold Jesus is born
Glory to God in the highest
Behold Jesus is born
Glory to God forever
Now is hope in our lives
Cause God is loving and kind
Even though we fail
He's still emmanuel

Hallelu
Hallelujah
Behold Jesus is born
Glory to God in the highest
Behold Jesus is born
Glory to God forever

He is our shepard and he is our strength
I won't be afraid, I won't be afraid
He is our comfort and he is our fill
I won't be afraid, I won't be afraid

Behold Jesus is born
Glory to God in the highest
Behold Jesus is born
Glory to God forever

Behold Jesus is born
Glory to God in the highest
Behold Jesus is born
Glory to God forever

Behold Jesus is born
Glory to God forever"
