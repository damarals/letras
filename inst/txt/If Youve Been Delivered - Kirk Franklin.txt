"1" "If You've Been Delivered
Kirk Franklin

If ya been delivered stand up on your feet and praise the Lord,
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [repeat]

Here's the Knowledge, get your pen and paper
A spiritual caper, You'll be calling me later
seeking Godly wisdom that's 2000 years in the making
I'm taking the lesson that holds your deliverance
asking me how God can save a man, raise a man
the enemy he pays your man
so why you judging me and your buggin me
just remember me ain't no fearing me
you'll hearing me

If ya been delivered stand up on your feet and praise the Lord,
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [repeat]

You can shout to this, bounce to this
clap to this, as long as you don't question this
radical, acrobatical, Jesus Christ fanatical
sabbatical taker, innovator, in love with the Creator
since I was a baby I know folk hate me
but lately don't really matter what you say
them silly games you try and play
I represent the One who healed me
Gods people can you feel me

If ya been delivered stand up on your feet and praise the Lord,
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [repeat]

All the people on the left
all the people on the right
clap your hand

make my praise the high praise
I want to lift Him up [repeat]
