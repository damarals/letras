"1" "Never Lose Sight Of The Goals
For Today

We're all people with a dream.
Some good, some bad
Some are real, and some are just fads.
Who will come out on top,
And who will just give it up?

God has his own plans for us.
It's not ours, it's His.
It's time to give it up.
Keep your head up high
And never lose sight
Of the goals.

We will never give up.
(Never lose sight, of the goals within us)
We will never give up
And He will never back down.
Seek and live everyday
To never worry what he'll say.
He will never back down.
It's not ours, to decide.
Shake it, move.
In the end there will be no doubt.
We will never lose sight of the goals."
