"1" "The Wonder Of Your Love
Hillsong United

You inhabit the
Praises of Your people
You delight in the
Glory of Your Son
In the love of the Father
We will worship
In the kingdom of God
We find our home

The wonder
Of Your love
Will break the
Chains that bind us
The power
Of Your touch
Releases us
To worship

Sing out to God
Sing hallelujah
With all we are
We will worship You
Holy is Your Name
Holy is Your Name
Oh God

Together we will lift
The name of Jesus
Together we sing
Of Your great love
We will join with the
Angels to praise You
May our voices
Be pleasing to You God"
