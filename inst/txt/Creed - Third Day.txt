Third Day

I believe in God the Father,
Almighty Maker of heaven and Maker of earth,
And in Jesus Christ His only begotten son our Lord.
He was conceived by the Holy Spirt, born of the virgin Mary.
Suffered under Pontius Pilot
Where he was crucified dead and buried.

(Chorus:)
And I believe what I believe in
Is what makes me what I am.
And I did not make it, no it is making me
It is the very truth of God and not the invention of any man.

I believe that He who suffered was crucified, buried and dead.
He descended into hell and on the third day He rose again.
He ascended into heaven where He sits at God's mighty right hand.
I believe that He's returning to judge the quick and the dead of the sons of men.

(Chorus)

I believe it, I believe it.
I believe it.

I believe in God the Father,
Almighty Maker of Heaven and Maker of earth
And in Jesus Christ His only begotten Son our Lord.
I believe int the Holy Spirit, one Holy Church
The communion of saints, the forgiveness of sin
I believe in the resurrection
I believe in a life that never ends.

And I believe what I believe in
Is what makes me what I am.
And I did not make it, no it is making me
And I did not make it, no it is making me
And I did not make it, no it is making me
It is the very truth of God and not the invention of any man."
