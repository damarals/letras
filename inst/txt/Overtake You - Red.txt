"1" "Overtake You
Red

Time, it's eating me alive,
Unable to rewind,
Sink deeper while I'm climbing,
Never to arrive,
I gave you everything,
But you still need to feed,
And underneath it all I'm screaming out

[chorus]

Just carry one, just prove me wrong
I know that I'm dying right now.
And it seems like that I'm so far gone
But not for long.
I'll just be strong and keep knowing
That now I will overtake you.

You must want what you can use,
Won't risk what you can lose,
Play the victim while keep abusing,
Anyone you choose,
A painful consequence,
Of standing on your lies,
I'm barely breathing but I'm screaming out

(Just carry on)
I know that I'm dying right now,
And it seems that I'm so far gone
(Overtake you)
I'll just be strong and keep knowing
That know I will overtake you"
