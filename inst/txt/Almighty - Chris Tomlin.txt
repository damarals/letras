You have no rival
You stand alone
The heavens worship before your throne
There is no one like you

You have no equal
Your kingdom reigns
Yours is the highest of every name
There is no one like you

Almighty
We're standing in the presence of your majesty
You're holy
You alone the sovereign crown of royalty
You're the king of kings
Almighty

Our God eternal the great I am
The praise of angels will never end
There is no one like you

Eyes like fire
Face like the sun
A voice like thunder
Who was and is and is to come

I see the holy one, high and exalted
I hide my eyes and I tremble before him
I tremble before him
I see the holy one high and exalted
I hide my eyes and I tremble before him
I tremble, you are"
