Hillsong United

As I look at the world I begin to dream
Of the future
What's yet to be

Your love so strong for every one
You made us all
In your image

And you saved the day
When jesus came
And you took away
All the sin and shame
You made us right again

You came from god above
The father's only son
Saved my soul
Made me new
And now I live for you

My heart is alive and my spirit free
In the saviour
Gave his life for me
By your word we will be
The light of the world
My father
Shine your light in me

I'll stand on the word
Be a light in the world
When your praises are heard
We'll be singing

I'll stand on the word
Be a light in the world
When your praises are heard
We'll be singing
We'll be singing
We'll be singing
We'll be singing"
