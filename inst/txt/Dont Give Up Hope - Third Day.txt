"1" "Don't Give Up Hope
Third Day

This world just keeps on getting crazier and crazier everyday
You’re so afraid
Sometimes it feels like it’s chasing your sanity away
And you start to break
Let me help you find your way

Don’t give up faith
Don’t give up hope
There’s always something better
Waiting around the corner
Don’t give up now
Please, don’t let go
What can feel like the ending
Could just be the beginning
Don’t give up hope

Your life is spinning like a rocket that’s gone out of control
And you’ve let go
You’re slowly losing your confidence, you’re a wounded soul
But I hope you know
I can help you find your way

Don’t turn around
Keep on moving
Find your faith
And you’ll be doing alright now

Don’t look back
Keep on moving
Find your faith
And you’ll be doing alright now"
