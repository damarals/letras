"1" "Blindfold
Delirious

take this blind fold off of me
i'm walking but i cannot see
mysteries fly at my feet
the answers come with no relief

broken shoes won't get u far
climb on my back i'll carry u afar
words just feel ansethetized
but hope is found between the lines

and i keep walking down that road
and i keep running down that road

glory glory
glory in the highest
