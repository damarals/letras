"1" "I've Been Up
Coral Resgate

I've been up, I've been down
But i'll never turn around
I've been glad, I've been sad
But I'll never turn around

I remember Lord, what you've done for me
I remember Lord how you set me free
I remember Lord how you brought me out
But i'll never, never. No, no, no,no,no,no don't turn around"
