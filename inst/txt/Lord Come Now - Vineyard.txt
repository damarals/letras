"1" "Lord Come Now
Vineyard

Lord, come now
Let Your glory be known
Let Your power be shown
Let Your love rain down on me now

I am hungry for You Lord
I am thirsty for Your presence
And I will worship You in the beauty
of Your holiness

Here I stand on sacred ground
Your holiness surrounds me
And I give to You this fragile heart"
