"1" "Give Thanks
Celina Borges

Give thanks with a grateful heart, give thanks to the holy one
Give thanks because his given Jesus Christ His son
Give thanks with a grateful heart, give thanks to the holy one
Give thanks because his given Jesus Christ His son

And now let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Because of what the Lord has done for us
And now let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Because of what the Lord has done for us

Louvar com o coração, lembrar de agradecer
A Deus por nos dar Jesus Cristo Seu filho
E eu que era fraco hoje sou forte
Que era pobre hoje sou rico
Transformado pelo amor de Deus

And now let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Because of what the Lord has done for us give thanks"
