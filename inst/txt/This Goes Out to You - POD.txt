"1" "This Goes Out to You
P.O.D.

I've been around so many places
Identical odds a million faces
Ups and downs traditional phases
And I
I ain't gonna change [?] nation
Four corners of the world positive vibration
And stereo beats were our foundations
And I

Hey you!
This goes out to you!
For all the things you do!
Hey ey ey
This song goes out to you!
For everything and all that we go through!

All sold out uneducated
Block connected street related
All original never duplicated
And I
I want you to know my appreciation
Through all of these years you're an inspiration
In honour of you it's a celebration
And I

Hey you!
This goes out to you!
For all the things you do!
Hey ey ey
This song goes out to you!
For everything and all that we go through!

You're my one foundation
A higher renovation
A new revelation
And I

Hey you!
This goes out to you!
For all the things you do!
Hey ey ey
This song goes out to you!
For everything and all that we go through!
Hey you!
This goes out to you!
For all the things you do!
Hey ey ey
This song goes out to you!"
