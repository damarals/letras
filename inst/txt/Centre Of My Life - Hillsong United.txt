"1" "Centre Of My Life
Hillsong United

Let my walk speak loud, and my words be true
Let my life bo whole, with my eyes on You.
Lord I'm stepping out, from the comfort zone
letting go of me, holding on to You

Freedom comes, when I call You lord
You are Lord, my God.
You are the centre of it all

The universe declares in awe
Your majesty, I surrender all
I make You the centre of my life
Lord I respond with all I am
You placed in me the song of heaven's melody
Your majesty, I live to sing Your song

I have found Your peace, it replaces any fear
You have done it all, I can trust in You.
Lord I'm stepping out, from the confort zone
Letting go of me, holsing on to You
This is Your song, not mine
It is Your song, that brings healing to this land
This is Your song, not mine
It is Your song, that brings freedom"
