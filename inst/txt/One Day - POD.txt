P.O.D.

The deeper and deeper I fall, deeper and deeper I seek,
Deeper and deeper I try and deeper and deeper I need

Forgive Me (4x)

And all I see is Your face (2x)

The deeper and deeper i fall, deeper and deeper I seek
Deeper and deeper I try, the deeper and deeper I need
The deeper and deeper I fail, deeper and deeper I read
Deeper and deeper I cry, the deeper and deeper I feed

Caught up in this game of life, me against you
Not doing what I should, just the things that I want to
So wrapped up, terrified of what I become
Outside I'm laughing, inside I'm numb
I can't see the light because it blinds me
Try to forget but my past always remidns me
Exposed, looked on by eyes of grace
I'm so ashamed, Don't look at my face

All I see is your face (4x)

Get up by your strength, I rise up to thee
But I'll stay on my face if you will of me
Shape and Mold me til your though
Humble myself, life laid down before you
I need your wisdom, so the truth I keep on living
And your love will always be a part of me
Can't do a thing, if I ain't living for the kind
So don't ever leave or take your eyes off me

It's not who you are It's who you're living for

Trials and tribulations will come"
