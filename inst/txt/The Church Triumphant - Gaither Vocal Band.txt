"1" "The Church Triumphant
Gaither Vocal Band

Let the church be the church, let the people rejoice
Oh, we've settled the question
We've made our choice
Let the anthems ring out, songs of victory swell
For the church triumphant is alive and well

This ship's been through battles before
Storms and tempests and rocks on the shore
Tho' the hull may be battered
Inside it's safe and dry
It will carry its cargo to the port in the sky

Let the church be the church
Let the people rejoice
Oh, we've settled the question
We've made our choice
Let the anthems ring out, songs of victory swell
For the church triumphant is alive and well
Is alive, is alive, is alive
For the church triumphant is alive and well"
