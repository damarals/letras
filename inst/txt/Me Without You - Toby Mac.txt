"1" "Me Without You
Toby Mac

Raindrops rolling off my brim
Street lights got the pavement glistenin'
Touchdown, I've fallen to Your arms, right where I belong
Your everlasting arms

And where would I be without You...
I'd be packing my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin every breeze that blows my way
I've been building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
Its true
That's me without you
That's me without you
That's me without you
Dont know where I'd be without you

Flashback
Stepping through the scene
There's You and theres a very different Me.
Touchdown, You had me at believe,
You had me at believe, You did

And where would I be without You...
I'd be packing my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin every breeze that blows my way
I've been building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
Its true
That's me without
That's me without you
That's me without you
Dont know where I'd be without you

You rescued me
You are mine, I am Yours
You rescued me
And I am Yours forever
You saved me, remade me,
Where would I be.

I'd be packing my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin every breeze that blows my way
I've been building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true

I'd be packing my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasin every breeze that blows my way
I've been building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true

That's me without you
That's me without you
That's me without you
Dont know where I'd be without you
That's me without you
Dont know where I'd be without you"
