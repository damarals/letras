"1" "I Will Be The Man
Warren Barfield

What would I do if you were gone?
What would I do if you were here?
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna face that fear
I'm on my knees now
Don't leave me

And I will be the man who put you first
I will be the man who give you all the love you're worth
Just give me the chance to start again
And I will be the man I've never been

I've wasted so much time
Chasing after lies I am lost I need you to find me
I'm on my knees now
Don't give up on me

And I will be the man who put you first
I will be the man who give you all the love you're worth
Just give me the chance to start again
And I will be the man I've never been

Give me one more day and I won't waste it
Spend every minute loving you


And I will be the man, put you first
I will be the man who give you all the love you're worth
Just give me the chance to start again
And I will be the man I've never been"
