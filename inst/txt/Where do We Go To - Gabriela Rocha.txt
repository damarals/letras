"1" "Where do We Go To?
Gabriela Rocha

Where'd we go?
You have the eternal life
Thou art the bread that came down from heaven
Source of life, emanuel
With thy glory over me
Fills me with you
To overflowing
I will never satisfy me
Fills me with you
To overflowing

Where'd we go?
Only you have the words of eternal life
Where do we go?
Thou art the bread of heaven
The emanuel God
Fill me, fill me
To overflowing

With thy glory over me
Fills me with you
To overflowing
I will never satisfy me
Fills me with you
To overflowing"
