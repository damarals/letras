"1" "You Are The Only One
Casting Crowns

One more mother with a broken heart
One more family is torn apart
One more orphan out in the cold
One more fear that takes control
One more tangled in the same old lies
One more shackled to the same old highs
One more scared of what tomorrow brings
And one more chasing yesterday

Lord, let your kingdom come

Who can right every wrong
You are the only one
Who can calm every storm
You are the only one
You alone are father, savior, spirit, healer, redeemer
Lord of all
You are the only one

One more skeptic to believe
One more prisoner has been set free
One more longs to be your hands and feet
One more standing for the least of these
One more praying in the morning light
One more shining in the darkest night
One more life worth fighting for
No greater love worth dying for

Lord, let your kingdom come
Lord, let your will be done

I want to know you more
I want to make you known
I want this world to see
That youre alive in me
Jesus, youre the only one

(Father, savior, spirit)
You are the only one
(Redeemer, lord of all)
You are the only one"
