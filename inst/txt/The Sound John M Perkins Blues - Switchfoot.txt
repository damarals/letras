"1" "The Sound (John M. Perkins' Blues)
Switchfoot

The static comes in slow
You can feel it grow
Our stream of conscience flows
Under the streets below
Ohhhhh, ohhhhhh
Ohhhhh, ohhhhhh

The rivers made a sound
Still running underground
Runs like a silent flood
We run as thick as blood

Can you hear it rise?
Up from the ground
Can't drown it out
Can you hear it now?

- Chorus -
This is the sound of a heartbeat!
This is the sound from the discontented mouths
Of a haunted nation
We are the voice of breaking down!
Can you hear me? This is the sound!
Of a desperation bound by a heart collision
We are the voice of breaking down!

The static comes alive
Beneath the broken skies
John Perkins said it right
\"Love is the final fight\"
Ohhhhh, Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhh, Ohhhhhh

Let it rise above! Rise above!
There is no sound
Louder than love

- Chorus -
This is the sound of a heartbeat!
This is the sound from the discontented mouths
Of a haunted nation
We are the voice of breaking down!
Can you hear me? This is the sound!
Of a desperation bound by a heart collision
We are the voice of breaking down!

Down, down, down
Let it rise above
Up from the ground
You can't drown it out
Can you hear it now?

- Chorus -
This is the sound of a heartbeat!
This is the sound from the discontented mouths
Of a haunted nation
We are the voice of breaking down!
Can you hear me? This is the sound!
Of a desperation bound by our fallen condition
We are the voice of breaking down!
This is the sound, this is the sound! >"
