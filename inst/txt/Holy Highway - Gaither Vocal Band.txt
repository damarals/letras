"1" "Holy Highway
Gaither Vocal Band

There's a road called the holy highway that once was a desert land.
Very soon you'll hear the sound of a holy marching band and.
Everlasting joy upon them, there's a remnant strong and true.
We bring the song back to Zion; we bring the praise back to you.

Chorus:
We exalt You, God Almighty, You are worthy to be praised.
Let all nations bow before You, Holy Ancient of all days.

There's a road called the holy highway, where the people dance and shout.
For the enemy is running with confusion all about.
Raise our banners in the victory; raise them high His word is true.
We bring our song back to Zion, we bring the praise back to you.

Repeat Chorus:
We exalt You, God Almighty, You are worthy to be praised.
Let all nations bow before You, Holy Ancient of all days.

Tag:
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
Holy, holy holy is the Lord.
Halelujah, halelujah, halelujah.
We bring the song back to Zion
We bring the praise back to You.

There's a road called the holy highway that once was a desert land.
Very soon you'll hear the sound of a holy marching band and.
Everlasting joy upon them, there's a remnant strong and true.
We bring the song back to Zion; we bring the praise back to you.

Repeat Chorus:
We exalt You, God Almighty, You are worthy to be praised.
Let all nations bow before You, Holy Ancient of all days.
