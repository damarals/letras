"1" "Look To The Cross
Hillsong United

Cover me
In stillness you are welcome here
Corfort me
And teach me Lord to know your peace

I look to the cross
Lord let me see your love anew
There I find peace, there I find peace again

Draw me near
Into your arms
Strength I know
Lift my soul
To rest in you my only hope

I look to the cross
Lord let me see your love anew
'Cause there I find peace, there I find peace again
I look to the cross
Lord let me see your love anew
'Cause there I find peace, there I find peace again

'Cause the Lord my light and my salvation
Who man shall I be afraid
I'll never be the same
The Lord my light and my salvation
Who man shall I be afraid
I'll never be the same again
In you I find peace again

I look to the cross
Lord let me see your love anew
There I find peace, there I find peace again
I look to the cross
Lord let me see your love anew
'Cause there I find peace, there I find peace again"
