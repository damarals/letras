"1" "My Father's Hand
Cristina Mel

In the smile of a child
I can see my Father's hand
In sunrise,in sunset
I can see my Father's hand
In the rhythm of a song
In the beating of a heart

I see the hand of God
Guiding our lives

In the love that makes me fly high
I see my Father's hand
Just be looking into your eyes
I see my Father's hand
Fell my Father's hand

Years come
Years go
But my Father's Word remains
Kingdoms rise
Kingdoms fall
But my Father's Words remains
Above all the universe
No one ever loved so much

I see my Father's hand
I fell my Father's hand
