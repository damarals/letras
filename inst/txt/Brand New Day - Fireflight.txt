"1" "Brand New Day
Fireflight

I'm waking up
The world is turning
The sun
Is shining again
I'm holding on
To things I shouldn't
It's time
To let them go
I've been
On a losing streak
Hit so hard
I couldn't speak
But when I hear
Your voice
It fades away

And I can hear You say
It's a brand new day
The pain goes away
I'm headed for the door
And I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home

Your love, it burns
Away my darkness
You guide me
When I'm blind
You are the light
That shines inside me
Showing me I'm
So much more
When I've been
On a losing streak
Hit so hard
I couldn't speak
But when I hear
Your voice
It fades away

Take me into Your arms
My home lies
Wwithin Your heart"
