Restore me
Restore me

I lost everything I had inside a couple years
Lost my faith, I lost my mind, I lost a lot of tears
I spoke up about these problems that I saw outside
People turned they back on me, you woulda swore I died
Molested, abused, abandoned, arrested, accused, and stranded
I grew up with all this trauma, it's nothing, forget it happened
'Til years later it show up, life is starting to blow up
Faith is starting to crumble, these critics starting to mumble
Oh my God, I feel dead inside, feel like suicide
Gone too far to turn back, he said, \"Boy, you tellin' lies\"
Was deep inside the trenches of the Devil's lair
They say, \"How you get up out? \" I just said a prayer

Use all this pain, use all this hurt
To grow me
If that's what it takes to know what I'm worth
Restore me, yeah, yeah
Use all this pain, use all this hurt
To grow me, yeah
If that's what it takes to know what I'm worth
Restore me"
