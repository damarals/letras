"1" "Let Your Light Shine
Hillsong United

Verse 1:
Crep, creep, creep in the dark fear comes to blow out all your lights.
It doesn't want you telling everybody that Jesus rules, all right!

Chorus:
Let your light shine Whoa
Let your light shine Whoa
Let Your light shine and let Jesus shine through you

Verse 2:
Giant fears are really small when all you see is God
Don't be afraid to stand up tall and give a great big shout

Bridge:
I'm not scared, I'm gonna let my light shine
You're not scared, you're gonna let your light shine
We're not scared, we're gonna let our light shine
Cos Jesus is Lord, and He's gonna let His light shine"
