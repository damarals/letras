It Is No Secret

The chime of Time rings out the news
Another day is through
Someone slipped and fell
Was that someone you
You may have longed for added strength
Your courage to renew
Do not be disheartened
For I bring hope to you

Chorus:
It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others
He will do for you
With arms wide open
He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do

There is no night for in His Light
You'll never walk alone
Always feel at home
Wherever you may roam
No evil power can conquer you
While God is on your side
Just take Him at His promise
Don't run away and hide

Repeat chorus"
