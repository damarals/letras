"1" "All For You
Victor Viana

Don't forget that you're My son
And the place you've come from
Above all things that I say
That you reign

Don't forget that I love you
And My love is the truth
To everybody that see
My Son in you

See Jesus
See the glory
See that He was
The first, the last, the only

I love you
That's the truth
Don't you never ever forget
What I have done for you

Maybe you'll cry
Son of Mine
Just remember My last breath
And how it was it all for you"
