Jeremy Camp

Innocence is calling
The way it's always been
I can feel my heart is reaching
I can see the calling to show your heart within
Cause I know your blood is healing
All I am today
And all I am is what your hands have made me
Here my soul is yielding

Refrão:
As I fall down I give all these weak hands have forsaken
As I fall down before you
I know I've been broken

Lord I feel drawing my heart into your love
I can hear your voice is pleading
I can see you molding the shape of purity
I am what you've laid before me
Here my soul is yielding

(Refrão)

As I fall down before the one
Whose hand has reached me out of this fear and doubt
That's stolen
All man's hope of knowing you

As I fall down I give all these weak hands have forsaken
As I fall down before you
I know I've been broken"
