"1" "All Who Are Thirsty
Kutless

All who are thirsty
All who are weak
Come to the fountain
Dip your heart in the stream of life
Let the pain and the sorrow
Be washed away
In the waves of his mercy
As deep cries out to deep (we sing)

Come Lord Jesus come
(repeat 3 times)

Holy Spirit come
(repeat 3 times)

As deep cries out to deep
(repeat 2 times)
