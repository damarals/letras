Take 6 ( Jesus Makes me Happy )

Jesus Makes me Happyâ€¦

Somebody said if you're happy Clap your hands
Silence wasn't my answer
Sorrow changed my plan
Then the Holy Spirit Touched my soul
Now I clap my hands for Jesus
Everywhere I go because

Chorus:
Jesus makes me happy Jesus makes me glad
Jesus is the center of all the joy I have (repeat)

Somebody said if you're happy Stomp your feet
But I was crippled by my loneliness Lost and incomplete
But since I met the Savior Things have changed
Now I'm happy and I know it So, I stomp in Jesus's name

Chorus:

So if you're happy
Then clap your hands for Jesus
So if you're happy
Then stomp your feet for Jesus
So if you're happy
Then live your life in Jesus And let the whole world know
The reason for your smile

Chorus"
