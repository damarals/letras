Hillsong United

VERSE 1:
All the earth come alive
Lift your eyes to the morning
Let our hearts beat again
With a lifeblood that never fails
Your love it will never fail

VERSE 2:
Breaking down the divide in a holy collision
The Divine in disguise
Took the cross for our sin and shame
Our God You will never fail

VERSE 3:
See the lost in return
Swing the doors ever wider
See the tide as it turns
Love and mercy is on the rise
As the world folds into
Your light All creation will see Your light

VERSE 4:
Hear the sound of freedom rise
As our song breaks the silence
Echoing the angel cry
Let us lift up Your holy Name
Here after to sing
Your praise Forever and ever

CHORUS:
We will hold
We will love
We will fall in surrender...
We will rise
We will run
We will live to declare Your name
Forever to bring You praise
Forever we'll lift up Your Name
Jesus Jesus

VERSE 5:
The universe on its knees
See the stars in surrender
God above kings and queens
Every idol will bend and break
But our God You will never fail
Forever and ever

BRIDGE:
Swing the doors wider
Sound the praise louder
All our hearts cry out
For the glory of Your
Name Our God You will never fail
Lift the Name higher
Shine the light brighter
All the earth cry out
For the glory of Your Name
Our God You will never fail"
