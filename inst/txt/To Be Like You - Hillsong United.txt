"1" "To Be Like You
Hillsong United

VERSE
Humble King
Holy One
Friend of sinners
God's own Son
God in flesh
Among men
You walked my road
You understand

Servant King
Friend to me
You saved my soul
Washed my feet
Here I'll bow
Give all to You
Lord I want
To be like You

CHORUS
All I want
All I need
More of You
Less of me
Take this life
Lord it's Yours
Have my heart
Have it all

VERSE
I will walk
In Your ways
Love Your word
Seek Your face
My reward
My sole pursuit
To know You more
To be like You

BRIDGE
Jesus Jesus
All I want is to be like You"
