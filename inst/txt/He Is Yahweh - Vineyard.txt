Vineyard

Who is moving on the waters?


Who is holding up the moon?


Who is peeling back the darkness?


With the burning light of noon?





Who is standing on the mountains?


Who is on the earth below?


Who is bigger than the heavens?


And the lover of my soul?




***Chorus***
Creator God: He is Yahweh


The Great I Am: He is Yahweh


The Lord of All: He is Yahweh


Rose of Sharon : He is Yahweh


The Righteous Son: He is Yahweh


The Three-in-one: He is Yahweh





Who is He that makes me happy?


Who is He that gives me peace?


Who is He that brings me comfort?


And turns the bitter into sweet?





Who is stirring up my passion?


Who is rising up in me?


Who is filling up my hunger?


With everything I need?


***Chorus***


You are holy and eternal


And forever You will reign


Every knee will bow before You


Every tongue will confess your name





All the angels give you glory


As they stand before Your throne


And here on Earth we gather


To declare Your name alone

***Chorus***(2x)



Ungu Tixo wami

Uyi Nqaba yami

Uli Qhawe Iami

Yesu mwana Nzambe

***Chorus***"
