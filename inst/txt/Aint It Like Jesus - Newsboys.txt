(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
(Yeah, man)

I've seen dark clouds turn into brighter days
I've seen hope rise up from a broken place

Yet it always blows my mind
When the water turns to wine
He does what only He can do

Ain't it like Jesus
To flip the situation?
Ain't it like Jesus?
Zero limitations
There is nothing that He cannot do
(Oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
Watch Him take the old and make it new

Ain't it like Jesus? (Always in the nick of time)
(Changin' up the paradigm)
Ain't it like Jesus? (Oh-oh, oh)
Ain't it like Jesus?

When I'm miles from the shore, I'll be singin' praise (Woah)
'Cause I know the only voice that calms the waves

Yet it always blows my mind
How He opens blinded eyes
He does what only He can do

Ain't it like Jesus
To flip the situation?
Ain't it like Jesus?
Zero limitations
There is nothing that He cannot do
(Oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
Watch Him take the old and make it new
(Yeah)

Ain't it like Jesus? (Always in the nick of time)
Ain't it like Jesus? (Changin' up the paradigm)
Ain't it like Jesus? (Oh-oh, oh)
Ain't it like Jesus?

Ain't it like my God
To show up right on time?
Ain't it like my God?
Workin' mornin', noon, and night
Ain't it like my God (Ain't it like, ain't it like)
To make the wrong things right? (Alright)
Ain't it like my God? (My God, my God)
Every time, every time

The only One you'll ever need (Ay-ay)
Is right here with you and me (Oh-oh)
Turning losses into victories (Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh)

There is nothing that He cannot do
(Oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
Watch Him take the old and make it new (Oh-oh)

Ain't it like Jesus? (Always in the nick of time)
Ain't it like Jesus? (Changin' up the paradigm)
Ain't it like Jesus? (Oh-oh, oh)
Ain't it like Jesus? (Woah-oh-oh-oh)

Ain't it like Jesus? (Ain't it like Jesus?)
Ain't it like Jesus? (Ain't it like Jesus?)
Ain't it like Jesus? (Ain't it like Jesus?)
Ain't it like Jesus?
(Yeah, man)"
