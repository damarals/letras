"1" "I Believe
Chris Dur√°n

I'm lonely, none wants to help me
Rejected, my life is so empty
His lighting, suddenly appears to me
It comes throught me
Give me such bliss
What is it?
Just try it
Who is Him?
Ask for Him
I believe, to Him
I believe
I've been touched by His angels
I believe
I've been touched by His word
And I feel, His love is forever
Do you know what I feel
Just let you go and ask for Him!!!"
