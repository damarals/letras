Verse:
I will bless the Lord at all times
His praises shall be in my mouth
I will boast in the Lord the humble shall hear
And be glad
I will bless the Lord at all times
His praises shall be in my mouth
I will boast in the Lord the humble shall hear
And be glad

Oh magnify the Lord with me
Let us exalt His name together
This is how it's supposed to be
All of the saints blessing His name

For the Lord is good
And His mercy endureth forever
If you love Him, you should
Always give Him praise
For that's why we were made
We were made to give Him praise.

Vamp:
I'll bless the Lord
At all, at all times
I will bless the Lord
At all, at all times

I will bless Him, at all times
Bless Him, at all times
I'll bless Him at all times
And His praises shall be in my mouth

I'll bless him"
