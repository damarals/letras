"1" "But For Now
Vineyard

I stare up at the sky wondering in my pain
My heart is parched and dry
I see dark clouds but there's no rain

But I'll trust in You, Lord
And in Your unfailing love
I ask You to hear me
But for now I will

Wait(hope), I will wait(hope)
Crying for mercy
Would You lift me up while I
Wait(hope), I will wait(hope)
I lay my life down
And my soul waits(hopes) for You

(And) They that wait upon You, Lord
We will be strong
We will rise up with wings like eagles
We will run and not grow weary
Lord, I call out to You now"
