"1" "Stand Firm, My Son
Ricardo SÃ¡

Stand firm, my son, here comes your Lord, your savior
Stand firm, my son, the crown is already in your hands.

look at the narrow road, gaze at the narrow gate
But it's too hard, when you can't see,
That the Holy Spirit is with thee.

Stand firm, my son, here comes yuor Lord, your savior
Stand firm, my son, the crown is already in your hands

I know that you suffer in pain, the times of trouble remain
Dut with faith, you will see
When you give in to the Lord you have peace

Stand firm, my son, here comes your Lord, your savior
Stand firm, my son, the crown is already in your hands.

See that the cross is yours, follow your Christ in pain
And then you'll know, that the pain,
Is the door that leads you to faith"
