"1" "Grace And Love
Kutless

Many things in life are hard for me
Many things can pull us down
I don't understand why I do what I do
How could I take my eyes off you
After all You've done for me
And after all You've done for me

It's by grace and love I am saved
It's by grace and love You've forgiven me
And by that love and grace I'm amazed
It's by grace and love I am free
I am free, I am free, I am free

And it's by grace and love that I am free
I'll live with You eternally
I thank you Lord that I am free
I thank You Lord for loving me
I thank You Lord for dying upon the tree of Calvary
I thank You Lord for loving me
I thank You Lord for dying for me

Because it's by grace and love I am saved
It's by grace and love You've forgiven me
And by that love and grace, I'm amazed
It's by grace and love I am free
I am free, I am free, I am free

Many things in life are hard for me
Many things can pull us down
But by grace and love You've forgiven me
And by grace and love we are free
