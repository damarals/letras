"1" "Once You Find Love
Warren Barfield

Once you find love you can't let go
Once you find a heartbeat like your own
Wherever it leads you, you must go
Yeah, once you find love you can't let go

Every soul in history
They have craved what we have
All I knows is I will hold you forever

Once you find love you can't let go
Once you find a heartbeat like your own
Wherever it leads you, you must go
Yeah, once you find love you can't let go

Oh you know what we need
Just one thing keeps us breathing
You found love so hold me forever

Once you find love you can't let go
Once you find a heartbeat like your own
Wherever it leads you, you must go
Yeah, once you find love you can't let go
Let's hold on forever

Once you find love you can't let go
Once you find a heartbeat like your own
Wherever it leads you, you must go
Yeah, once you find love you can't let go
Can't let go
Once you find love"
