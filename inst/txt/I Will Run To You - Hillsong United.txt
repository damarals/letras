"1" "I Will Run To You
Hillsong United

Your eye is on the sparrow
And Your hand it conforts me
From the ends of the earth
To the depths of my heart
Let Your mercy and stength be seen

You call me to Your purpose
As angels undertand
For your glory
May You draw all men
As Your love and grace demands

And I will run to You
It's Your words of truth
Not by might not by power
But by Spirit of God
Yes I will run the race
Till I see Your face
Oh let me live in the glory of Your grace"
