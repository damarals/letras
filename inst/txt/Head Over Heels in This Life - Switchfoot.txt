"1" "Head Over Heels (in This Life)
Switchfoot

Head over here and take me
Head over heels and aching
When I told you I was yours,
I was yours

(chorus)
In this life you're the one place I call home
In this life you're the feeling I belong
In this life you're the flower and the thorn
You're everything that's fair in love and war

I'm coming down like a gun shot
In all these battles that I've fought
You're the mark I'm aiming for
I was yours

(chorus)

Head over heels
Head over heels

In this life I'm stubborn to the core
In this life I've been burning after more
We both know what these open arms are for
You're everything that's fair

In this life you're my only one
In this life you're my only one
In this life you're my only one
In this life you're my only one"
