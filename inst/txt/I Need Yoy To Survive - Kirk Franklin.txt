"1" "I Need Yoy To Survive
Kirk Franklin

I need you
you need me
we're all apart of God's body
stand with me agree with me
we're all apart of God's body

It is His will that every need be supplied
You are important to me
I need you to survive

I'll pray for you
You pray for me
I love you
I need you to survive
I won't harm You
With words from my mouth
I love You
I need you to survive"
