Youthful Praise

Verse:
I owe God praise for what He's done,
He loved me so that He gave His only son.
He came to earth just to save the lost,
by laying down His life on that rugged cross.

Chorus:
The devil thought he had Him,
He thought He was dead,
but he didn't know that it was all part of a plan;
'cause He rose with all power
in His hand, in His hand.

Verse

Chorus

Bridge:
He conquered death for me,
He conquered hell for me,
He conquered the grave for me
when He rose, when He rose.


He conquered death for me,
He conquered hell for me,
He conquered the grave for me
when He rose, when He rose.

He rose for me, oh yes.

Hallelujah, He rose.
Hallelujah, He rose.

He rose.
