Hillsong United

What yo say, Lord?
It's You who gave me life
And I can't explain just how much you mean to me
Now that You've saved me, Lord
I give all that I am to you
That everyday I can be a light that shines Your name

Everyday, Lord, I'll learn to stand upon your Word
And I pray that I might come to know You more
That you would guide me in every single step I take
That everyday I can be Your light unto the world.

Everyday it's You I live for
Everyday I'll follow after You
Everyday I'll walk with You, my lord

It's You I live for, everyday
It's You I live for, everyday
It's You I live for, everyday"
