"x"
"1" "Run To You
Michael W. Smith

Control, I give up control
I can't carry this alone
I've tried, for so long I've tried
To make it on my own
Now, dreams are scattered on the ground
And now I'm on my knees

I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I'm gonna run to You
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I'm gonna run to You, run to You

Weak, there are times I'm weak
If my scars could speak, they'd say
That grace is my only hope
And grace is showing me the way
To where all my shadows disappear
And healing waits for me

I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I'm gonna run to You
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I'm gonna run to You, run to You
I'm gonna run to You

What kind of love is this
That lifts me up and draws me in
Tonight I'm just a heart running back home
Everything is pushed aside
All my plans and all my pride
Tonight I'm just a heart coming back home
Oh yeah"
