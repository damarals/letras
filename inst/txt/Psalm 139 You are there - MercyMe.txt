"1" "Psalm 139 (You are there)
MercyMe

You have searched me and you know me
You're familiar with all my ways

You have placed your hand upon me
With such a knowledge I can't attain

Where can I go from your Spirit?
Where can I flee from your presence?

If I make my bed in the depths
If I go up to the heavens

You are there

If I rise on the wings of the dawn
If I settle on the far side of the sea

Even there your hand will hold me fast
Even there your hand will guide me

You are there
You are there

You have searched me and you know me
You're familiar with all my ways

You have placed your hand upon me
With such a knowledge I can't attain

Where can I go from your Spirit?
Where can I flee from your presence?

If I make my bed in the depths
If I go up to the heavens

You are there

If I rise on the wings of the dawn
If I settle on the far side of the sea

Even there your hand will hold me fast
Even there your hand will guide me

You are there

I will sing
Sing a new song
Because you love me

I will sing
Sing a new song
Because you care

I will sing
Sing a new song
Because you're there

I will sing
Sing a new song
Because you love me

I will sing
Sing a new song
Because you care

I will sing
Sing a new song
Because you're there
