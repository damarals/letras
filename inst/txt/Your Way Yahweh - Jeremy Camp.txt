"1" "Your Way Yahweh
Jeremy Camp

Your church is beautiful
Your church is broken
But You are holding us
Together in Your arms

At times we are shaken
But never forsaken
Jesus You're making us
More like who You are

Purify our hearts
Teach us how to walk in Your way
Yahweh
More of who You are
Tear down every wall in Your way
Yahweh

Bind us together
We're stronger together
And we will see greater things
When Your kingdom comes
Comes, oh come Lord Jesus

Purify our hearts
Teach us how to walk in Your way
Yahweh
More of who You are
Tear down every wall in Your way
Yahweh

God of hope
God of peace
You will never leave us
God who loves
God who keeps
You will always lead us home

Home
Home
Home

Purify our hearts
Teach us how to walk in Your way
Yahweh
More of who You are
Tear down every wall in Your way
Yahweh

Purify our hearts
Teach us how to walk in Your way
Yahweh
More of who You are
Tear down every wall in Your way
Yahweh

Purify our hearts
Teach us how to walk in Your way
Yahweh
More of who You are
Tear down every wall in Your way
Yahweh

Lead us home
Lead us home
Lead us home

Home

Lead us home
Oh, lead us home
Oh, lead us home

And lead us home

Lead us home
Lead us home
Lead us home
Home"
