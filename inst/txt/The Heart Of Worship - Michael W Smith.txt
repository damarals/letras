"1" "The Heart Of Worship
Michael W. Smith

When the music fades
And all is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring something that's of worth
That will bless your heart

Refrain:
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

Chorus
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
and it's all about You
It's all about You, Jesus
I'm sorry Lord for the things I've made
And it's all about You...
It's all about You, Jesus

King of endless worth
No one could express
How much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is yours
Every single breath"
