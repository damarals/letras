"1" "It Is Finished
Gaither Vocal Band

There’s a line that is drawn thru the ages
On that line stands an old rugged cross
On that cross a battle is raging
To gain a mans soul or it’s loss

On one side march the forces of evil
All the demons all the devils of hell
On the other the angels of glory
And they meet on Golgotha’s hill

The earth shakes with the force of the conflict
And the sun refuses to shine
For there hangs God’s son in the balance
And then thru the darkness He cries

Chorus
It is finished, the battle is over
It is finished, there’ll be no more war
It is finished, the end of the conflict
It is finished and Jesus is Lord

Yet in my heart the battle was still raging
Not all prisoners of war had come home
These were battlefields of my own making
I didn’t know that the war had been won

Oh but then I heard the king of the ages
Had fought all the battles for me
And that victory was mine for the claiming
And now praise His Name I am free"
