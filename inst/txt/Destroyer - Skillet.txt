Destroyer of the lies
Destroyer of the lies
Destroyer of the lies
Destroyer of the lies
I'm a warrior, the destroyer

What a twisted web you weave
Inside a maze of mirrors
But you're afraid you're false, I was deceived
You pull me in the fear, uh
You better get behind me
Break the ties that bind me
Feel the fear rising
No more of that, I've been had enough
When my demons try to pull me under
Into the person I don't wanna remember

Destroyer of the lies
See through your own disguise

I'm the destroyer, destroyer
I will not be your slave (I won't be your slave)
It's over, it's over
I will not walk away (I won't walk away)
This is no time for the faint at heart
It's time for war, war
I'm the destroyer

Facing down the enemy
They gonna take the prisoners
You could be caged, I threw away the key
I'll burn it down to smoking embers
And I will not be crucified
Open up my blinded eyes
Now before you realize
There's no way I can ever surrender
I feel the darkness coming to remind me
Of who I was, I put that person behind me

Destroyer of the lies
See through your own disguise
Destroyer of the lies
See through your own disguise
Your rebellious demise

I'm the destroyer, destroyer
I will not be your slave (I won't be your slave)
It's over, it's over
I will not walk away (I won't walk away)
This is no time for the faint at heart
It's time for war, war
I'm the destroyer

Destroyer
Destroyer
Destroyer
Destroyer

I'm the destroyer, destroyer
I will not be your slave (I won't be your slave)
It's over, it's over
I will not walk away (I won't walk away)
This is no time for the faint at heart
It's time for war, war
I'm the destroyer
War, war
I'm the destroyer (I won't walk away)
This is no time for the faint at heart
It's time for war, war
I'm the destroyer
I'm the destroyer
I'm the destroyer"
