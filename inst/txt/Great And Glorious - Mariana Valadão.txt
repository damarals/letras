"1" "Great And Glorious
Mariana Valadão

All the heavens praise Your wonderful way, Oh God
Choirs of angels sing, sing of all You’ve done, Oh God
Every knee will bow to worship at Your throne, Oh God
Every heart will cry: “Holy is Your name, Holy is Your name”.

Great and Glorious,
You Reign, You Reign
All the heavens and the earth cry out in praise

There’s no one higher, no one greater
No one is more powerful
There’s no one wiser, no one stronger
Than You
There’s no one higher, no one greater
No one is more powerful
There’s no one wiser, no one stronger
Than You, Our God

There’s no one like You, God
There’s no one like You, God"
