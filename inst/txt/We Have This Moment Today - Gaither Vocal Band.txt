"1" "We Have This Moment Today
Gaither Vocal Band

Hold tight to the sound Of the music of living,
Happy songs from the laughter of children at play;
Hold my hand as we run through
The sweet fragrant meadows,
Making mem'ries of what was today.

Chorus
We have this moment to hold in our hands
And to touch as it slips
Through our fingers like sand
Yesterday's gone
And tomorrow may never come
But we have this moment today

Tiny voice that I hear is my little girl calling
For Daddy to hear just what she has to say
And my little son running there by the hillside
May never be quite like today

Tender words
Gentle touch and a good cup of coffee
And someone who loves me
And wants me to stay
Hold them near while they're here
And don't wait for tomorrow
To look back and wish for today

Take the blue of the sky
And the green of the forest
And the gold and the brown
Of the freshly mown hay
Add the pale shades of spring
And the circus of autumn
And weave you a lovely today"
