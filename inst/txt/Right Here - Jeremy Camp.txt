"x"
"1" "Right Here
Jeremy Camp

All the world is Watching
All the world does care
Even when the world weighs on my shoulder now,
These feelings I can bare
Because I know,
That you're here,

(Chorus:)
Because everywhere I go,
I know you're not far away,
You're right here
You're right here, yeah (x2)

All these thoughts I've wasted,
All these thoughts I fear,
Even when these thoughts have faded,
I still know that you're here,
So I can rest my hope in you

(Repeat Chorus)

Many of times that I have felt alone,
Many of times that I have felt the world was crashing down upon me,
You always stood here by my side,
You were always there.

Because everywhere I go,
I know your not far away,
You're right here
You're right here, yeah (x4)"
