"1" "The Hypocrite
MÃºsicas Gospel

They preach do as I say,
But live a different way.
They see us all as fools,
And lies are their tools.

But when they face the man,
I don't think he'll understand.
'Cause he witnessed their lies,
And he heard their alibis.

Chorus:
Remember God is watching it,
And he recalls the hypocrite.
It is something you will admit,
When you're judged in the end.

I've seen them everywhere I go,
And they're someone many know.
'Cause in the things they do,
Not every word rings true.

I'm glad I'm a simple man,
Who didn't pull any scams.
'Cause on my judgement day,
God will believe what I say.

Chorus:
Remember God is watching it,
And he recalls the hypocrite.
It is something you will admit,
When you're judged in the end."
