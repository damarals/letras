"1" "So Close
Hillsong United

I'm so secure
You're here with me.
You stay the same
Your love remains
here in my heart.

(Chorus)
So close I believe
You're holding me now,
in Your hands I belong.
You'll never let me go;
So close I believe
You're holding me now
in Your hands I belong,
You'll never let me go.

You gave Your life
and Your endless love.
You set me free
& show the way
now I am found

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
All along You were beside me
even when I couldn't tell
and through the years
You showed me more of You
more of You

(Chorus)"
