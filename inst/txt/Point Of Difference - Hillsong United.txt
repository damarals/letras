Hillsong United

the tide is turning
this is redemptions hour
in the midst of a world lost for love
You are all we have now
the lost returning
salvation is all around
in the midst of the world broken down
You are all we have now
for You are God and this hope is ours
so Father open the skies
flood the earth with Your light
this is love
to break the world indifferent

our hearts are burning
a fire that won't burn out
in the midst of a world that's grown cold
You are all we have now
the earth resounding
the anthem of your reknown
as we lift up our eyes
and look to Your glory

call us out
let the world see
You are God
and this hope is ours
so call us out
let the world see
You are God, as we sing

so Father open the skies
flood the earth with Your light
this is love
to break the world indifferent
as we lift up our eyes
fill our hearts with Your fire
in a world of sin
we'll be different, the difference

our eyes are open
every chain now broken
in this world
we are different
let Your love become us
as we live to make You famous
in this world
we are different
so call us out
let the world see
You are God, as we sing

so call us out
let the world see
You are God
one and only
in this world
You are all we have now"
