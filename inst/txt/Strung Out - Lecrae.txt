Lecrae

(Hook)
How could I love you, when all you ever did was wrong
How could I trust you, you lied to me all along
You strung me out

(Verse 1)
I'm going through withdrawals, the shakes and all
You did me dirty, I almost died dawg
I let you play me and plus you gave me
All the filthy things I wanted all my sinful cravings
But I see you, yeah you see through
Somebody opened up my eyes and I don't need you
I gotta leave you before you take my life
I used to date you then I went ahead and made you wife, yeah
You had me feeding for the stuff you offer
You such a scoffer I know you want me in my coffin
But girl you already lost it, your ways are perished
Thank you God for your salvation this is what I cherish

(Hook)
How could I love you, when all you ever did was wrong
How could I trust you, you lied to me all along
You strung me out

(Verse 2)
I'm out your grip, I'm out your grasp
You had me mesmerized, you had me in your hands
Lust of the eyes, the pride of life
You offered me the world, you made it look so nice
You took me high but left me down and out
I run right back to you thinking that you would help me out
You never satisfy, you only gratify
You're just a bad illusion to every passerby
And I don't want you round, you only bring me down
So glad I quit you, I don't miss you cos you had me bound
So get gone

(Hook)
How could I love you, when all you ever did was wrong?
How could I trust you, you lied to me all along?
You strung me out

(Bridge)
Do not love the world or the things in the world.
If anybody loves the world, the love of God is not in him.
The world is passing away along with its desires but
Whoever does the will of God lives forever.
I know it hurts sometimes, we gotta go through withdrawal,
It's me that's strung out

(Hook)
How could I love you, when all you ever did was wrong?
How could I trust you, you lied to me all along?
You strung me out"
