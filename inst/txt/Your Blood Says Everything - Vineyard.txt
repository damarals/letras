"1" "Your Blood Says Everything
Vineyard

In the presence of holiness
When I cannot speak
Your blood says everything

In the presence of perfect love
I am too weak
But Your blood says everything
Your blood says everything

Hear the Word
Spoken from the tree
Heaven broken open
Your blood says everything
Your blood says everythin"
