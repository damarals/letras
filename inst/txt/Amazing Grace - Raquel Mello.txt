"1" "Amazing Grace
Raquel Mello

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost
But now am found
Was blind but now I see

Amazing grace
Shall always be my song of praise
For it was grace that brought my liberty
I'll never know
Just why Christ came to love me so
He looked beyond my faults and saw my need

Hallelujah"
