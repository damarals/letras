Hillsong United

I will come to You
With an open heart
And bring a sacrifice of praise
I have seen Your power
In the Holy Place
And I have known Your mighty ways

I will remember Your mercy
And Lord Your faithfulness

Lord Your goodness
And Your love will follow me
All the days of my life
Iâ€™m surrounded
With the favour of the Lord
Always and forever"
