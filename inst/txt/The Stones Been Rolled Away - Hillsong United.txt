"1" "The Stone's Been Rolled Away
Hillsong United

I've been forgiven
I've been set free
Restored and sanctified
In Christ I've been released
And I am free
The stone's been rolled away
And I am free
The stone's been rolled away

I've been delivered
I've been released
Been washed and purified
My God has set me free
I've been released
The stone's been rolled away
I've been released
The stone's been rolled away

Singing glory
Singing glory
Singing glory
Restored and sanctified
The stone's been rolled away
