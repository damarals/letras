Skillet

Driftin' beneath the horizon
Body is weak but I'm tryin'
To make it to shore
but I'm fallin' short I need You more
Wave after wave, I've been sinkin'
So unto Your promise I'm clingin'
You say that I'm strong, to You I belong
Keep holdin' on

You are my anchor
So steady me, steady me now
You are my anchor
You're keepin' my feet on the ground
In angry oceans You've never broken
Through every wave of the storm
You are my anchor
So steady me, steady me now
Come steady me, steady me now

When I get tired of fighting
All of the fears I've been hidin'
You gave me a breath and tell me to rest
You never left
I can, I can, I can hear You callin' me by name
Pullin' me up from under my shame
I'll never be the same
I can face anything
so let it rain

You are my anchor
So steady me, steady me now
You are my anchor
You're keepin' my feet on the ground
In angry oceans, You've never broken through
Every wave of the storm
You are my anchor
So steady me, steady me now
Come steady me, steady me now

Don't let go
I don't want to do this alone
Don't let go
I know that I'll drown on my own

You are my anchor
So steady me, steady me now
(Don't want to do this alone)
You are my anchor
You're keepin' my feet on the ground
(I know I'll drown on my own)
In angry oceans, You've never broken through
Every wave of the storm
You are my anchor
So steady me, steady me now
Come steady me, steady me now"
