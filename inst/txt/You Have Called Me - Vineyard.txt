"1" "You Have Called Me
Vineyard

You have called me by my name
You have drawn me to Your heart
Now I'll never be the same
Now I'll never be the same
Your mercy and Your grace
Have brought me to this place

Chorus:
Where I now know Your love for me
My Saviour's blood was shed for me
Now all my sins are washed from me
I believe"
