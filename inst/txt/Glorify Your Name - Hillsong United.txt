"1" "Glorify Your Name
Hillsong United

Jesus, Jesus
Holy one, God's precious son you gave.
Jesus, Jesus
On the cross you took my shame
Forever from my heart I'll say

CHORUS
I live to worship you, Lord
My king of glory
Brought me to life, gave me wings to fly
You are holy
Heaven and earth declare your grace
Both now and evermore
I glorify your name.

Jesus, Jesus
On the cross you took my sin
Forever from my heart I'll say

CHORUS

Jesus, I glorify your name."
