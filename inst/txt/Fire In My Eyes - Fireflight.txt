"1" "Fire In My Eyes
Fireflight

Feeling solid
â€˜Cause I have finally got my feet on the ground
Now You rescued me, You were gravity
I was upside down, down

I've got a fire in my eyes
I'm burning brighter than the sunlight
You orchestrated my escape
Now I'm awake
I feel alive for the first time
You ignite
The fire in my eyes

Used to live my life
Locked up inside a room with no door before
You found a window, You broke it
And now I won't be contained anymore

Oh, I know You are
The reason I can breathe
Oh, I know You are
The reason I am free"
