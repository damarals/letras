"1" "I'm Not Ashamed
Jeremy Camp

(I have this theory that if one person
Can go out of their way to show compassion
It starts a chain reaction)

In a world with pressures onto me
I will keep on pressing into you
You are where I run to draw my strength

In a world that says: don't believe
[?] hold on the truth
I will choose to trust where I can't see

I will give my life to you

I'm not ashamed, I'm not ashamed
I will hold up high your name
I'm not ashamed, I'm not ashamed
This is where my faith gets brave

And even if it costs me everything
I will stay in policy
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh oh

And I am not ashamed
Jesus, I am not ashamed

I surrender, here I leave my harms
I remember how you spread your arms
Even still this world stays in the dark

And I will fight the fight
I won't walk the line
You have [?] your life for mine

I'm not ashamed, I'm not ashamed
I will hold up high your name
I'm not ashamed, I'm not ashamed
This is where my faith gets brave

And even if it costs me everything
I will stay in policy
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh oh

And I am not ashamed
Jesus, I am not ashamed

This is my one desire
To burn with holy fire
My life may never fade away
This is my one defense
You're faithful til the end
You take my life and I still live

I'm not ashamed, I'm not ashamed
I will hold up high your name
I'm not ashamed, I'm not ashamed
This is where my faith gets brave

And even if it costs me everything
I will stay in policy
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh

And I am not ashamed
And I am not ashamed"
