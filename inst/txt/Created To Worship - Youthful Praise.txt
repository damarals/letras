Youthful Praise

I was created just to give you all the glory
I was created just to worship and adore thee
You are the son of the living God
Savior of the world
and I was created just to give
you all the glory
Created just to worship and adore thee
I was created just to give you all the glory
I was created just to worship and adore thee
You are the son of the living God
Savior of the world
I was created just to give you all the glory
I was created just to worship and adore thee
So I will lift my hand
Spread your praise across the land
And I will lift my voice
And realize I was chosen to rejoice
I was created just to give you all the glory
I was created just to worship and adore thee
So I will lift my hand
Spread your praise across the land
And I will lift my voice
I was chosen to rejoice
I was created just to give you all the glory
I was created just to worship and adore thee
I was created just to give you all the glory
I was created just to worship and adore thee"
