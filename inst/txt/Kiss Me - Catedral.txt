"1" "Kiss Me
Catedral

Kiss me I'm out of the bearded barley
Nightly beside the green green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You wear those shoes and I
Will wear that dress

Oh kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies
Dance silver moon's sparkling
So, kiss me

Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing me upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

Oh kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies
Dance silver moon's sparkling
So, kiss me





Ne*!"
