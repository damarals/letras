"1" "What A Love (redeemer)
Vineyard

What a love
You've taken all our shame and rescued us
A God of love You died for us to live
Now we see
A dim re Æ’Pection of what will be
We are Yours and it's for Eternity

You are our Redeemer
You are our treasure
The God who saves
You are our Redeemer

What can we say
But thank you Lord for the price You paid
Now broken hearts can sing of Your great love
Friends of God
This is what we have become
You are ours and it's for Eternity"
