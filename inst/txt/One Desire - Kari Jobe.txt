"1" "One Desire
Kari Jobe

Here I am
Just for You, only You
Here I stand
Wanting you, only you

In your presence Lord
I will find my strength
You're the breath in me
You're my everything

With my heart bowed low
And my hands held high
Oh Consumer Fire
You're my one desire

Your name, oh Your name
Let it stay on my lips
I will seek your face
God, it's You, only You

In your presence Lord
I will find my strength
You're the breath in me
You're my everything

With my heart bowed low
And my hands held high
Oh Consumer Fire
You're my one desire

In your presence Lord
I will find my strength
You're the breath in me
You're my everything

With my heart bowed low
And my hands held high
Oh Consumer Fire
You're my one desire

It's you, god
It's you
It's you, only you

My heart will always sing
I love you, I love you
My heart will always sing
I love you, I love you
My heart will always sing
I love you, I love you
My heart will always sing
I love you, I love you

In your presence lord
I will find my strength
You're the breath in me
You're my everything

With my heart bowed low
And my hands held high
Oh Consumer Fire
You're my one desire

In your presence Lord
I will find my strength
You're the breath in me
You're my everything

With my heart bowed low
And my hands held high
Oh Consumer Fire
You're my one desire

It's you, god
It's you
It's you, only you

Lord, it's you, god
It's you
It's you, only you

Yeah, it is you

My heart will always sing
I love you, I love you
My heart will always sing
I love you, I love
My heart will always sing
I love you"
