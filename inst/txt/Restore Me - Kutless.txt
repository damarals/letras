Kutless

Search my heart my every thought
Shine the light of truth on every part
Let me see myself through who you are
Where else can I go
Only you can make me whole

Restore me, pull me out of darkness
For your glory
Let the waves of mercy wash over me
holy, holy
Holy, I wanna see the fullness of your majesty
The beauty in the scars you're wearing for me
Jesus, please restore me

Broken now I'm at your feet
Cause without your love I'm incomplete
You're my only hope to be set free
Where else can I go
Only you can make me whole

Restore me, pull me out of darkness
For your glory
Let the waves of mercy wash over me
Holy, holy
Holy, I wanna see the fullness of your majesty
The beauty in the scars you're wearing for me
Jesus, please restore me

By your wounds we are healed
In your death you revealed perfect love
By your grace we are saved
Freedom's price has been paid
Through sacrifice you gave us life
Now from the grave we can rise

Restore me, pull me out of darkness
For your glory
Let the waves of mercy wash over me
Holy, holy
Holy, I wanna see the fullness of your majesty
The beauty in the scars you're wearing for me
Jesus, please

Restore me, pull me out of darkness
For your glory
Let the waves of mercy wash over me
Holy, holy
Holy, I wanna see the fullness of your majesty
The beauty in the scars you're wearing for me
Jesus please restore me
Please restore me
Restore me
Jesus, please restore me"
