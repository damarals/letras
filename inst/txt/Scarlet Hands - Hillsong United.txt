Hillsong United

When Brokeness and mercy meets
how gently shall redeemption speak
for love like ocean, waves breaking
upon the shores of sin and shame

to you my heart will sing, oh God
for all ones lover keeps this song
in spirit and in integrat(?)
to join the song that heavens sing

scarlet hands that bled for me
searvent king my everything
I knee before you once again
surrendered now to scarlet hands

when sorrow tries my hope to kill
to worship i have risen still
for light will (pass ?)the darkness night
and peace shall be my lullaby

scarlet hands that bled for me
searvent king my everything
I knee before you once again
surrendered now to scarlet hands

The time will fade to {?} toward
and in you forever shall I walk
in glory shadow [ever be ?]
redeemer and [redeemed to me ?]"
