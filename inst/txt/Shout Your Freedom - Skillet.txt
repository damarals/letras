"1" "Shout Your Freedom
Skillet

(Freedom)

You are a prisoner (Prisoner)
Of what they wanted you to be
Now you're a minister (Minister)
Of a brand new reality
Don't you wanna get away?
Shut down all the voices
All the white noises
Drowning me in deeper waves
I gotta get away

They think they own you but they don't know
You've broken free, better on your own
You're on top of the world
At the top of your lungs
Come on, and shout your freedom
Victory, His word has come alive inside
New life begun
Shout it out to the world
At the top of your lungs
Come on, and shout your freedom

And now you're flying high (Flying high)
You won't be held down by regrets
You're not just gettin' by (Gettin' by)
You're a warrior and proud of it
You don't have to be afraid
Hear how loud your voice is
Shut out all the noises
You don't have to be ashamed
So never run away

They think they own you but they don't know
You've broken free, better on your own
You're on top of the world
At the top of your lungs"
