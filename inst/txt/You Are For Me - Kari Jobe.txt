"1" "You Are For Me
Kari Jobe

So faithful
So constant
So loving and so true
So powerful in all You do

You fill me
You see me
You know my every move
You love for me to sing to You

I know that You are for me
I know that You are for me
I know that You will never
Forsake me in my weaknesses

I know that You have come now
Even if to write upon my heart
To remind me who You are

So patient
So gracious
So merciful and true
So wonderful in all You do

You fill me
You see me
You know my every move
You love for me to sing to You

I know that You are for me
I know that You are for me
I know that You will never
Forsake me in my weaknesses

I know that You have come now
Even if to write upon my heart
To remind me

I know that You are for me
I know that You are for me
I know that You will never
Forsake me in my weaknesses

I know that You have come now
Even if to write upon my heart
To remind me who You are

To remind me

I know that You are for me
I know that You are for me
I know that You will never
Forsake me in my weaknesses

I know that You have come now
Even if to write upon my heart
To remind me who You....are"
