"1" "Jehovah Welcomes You Home
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

It doesn't seem so long ago
When my name you've come to know
And it touched your heart
But you lost your way
Although you managed for a while
And some memories made you smile
It was in your heart to return one day

Welcome home my friend
Your life can start again
Stay beneath my wings
And know the lasting peace only I can bring

And I desire that you should know
What to do to come back home
As a ray of sun on a weary heart
Now here I stand with open arms
I'm your shelter from the storm
You can feel the joy of a brand new start

Welcome home my friend
Your life can start again
Stay beneath my wings
And know the lasting peace only I can bring

Now you're home"
