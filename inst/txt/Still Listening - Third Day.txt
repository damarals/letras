Lyrics by Mac Powell/Music by Third Day
From the recording: Come Together, Track #7.

There was a time when I thought that I had you
figured out
I told you before and I'll say once more
Now and then I have my doubts
I'll never pretend to know what you are doing
It's true that you move in mysterious ways

I looked for you in
The fire and the wind
But you weren't there as far as I could see
I thought I'd hear you shout
But then I figured it out
That all along you're whispering to me
And I'm still listening

Just when I thought that I had caught a glimpse of

who you are
You taught me a lesson I needed to learn
Right from the very start
I never will be the man that I quite need to be
But that's alright 'cause you're enough for me
"
