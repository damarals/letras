"1" "Psalm 19
Vineyard

May the words of my mouth
And the meditations of my heart
Be pleasing to you, pleasing to you
May the words of my mouth
And the meditations of my heart
Be pleasing to you my God

You're my rock and my redeemer
You're the reason that I sing
I desire to be a blessing
In your eyes
Every hour, every moment
Lord I want to be your servant
I desire to be a blessing
In your eyes, in your eyes"
