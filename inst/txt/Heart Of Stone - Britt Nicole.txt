"x"
"1" "Heart Of Stone
Britt Nicole

Brick by brick I built a hundred feet tall
All these walls are up higher
Than a I thought
Let my secret out, I want them to fall
Bars and barricades this ain't what I want

Like a prisoner
Like a prisoner
With these eyes of steel
I'm living like a prisoner
You know I closed the door
Yeah I closed the door
Yeah I did it 'cause
I didn't wanna hurt no more

They say that the armor makes you strong
I might be safe but I'm all alone
Been hiding from the light for way too long
Tell me you can break this heart of stone
Tell me you can break it
I need you to break it
Tell me you can break this heart of stone
Tell me you can break it
I need you to break it
Tell me you can break this heart of stone

Only you can break it
Only you can break it
Only you can break it, break it
Only you can break it
Only you can break it
Only you can break it, break it

Crash like broken glass
Shattered on the floor
Finally a victory I've never felt before
Now the gates are open
I'mma run right through that door
I'm never going back
To the chains I wore before

Like a prisoner
Like a prisoner
With these eyes of steel
I'm living like a prisoner
You know I closed the door
Yeah I closed the door
Yeah I did it 'cause
I didn't wanna hurt no more

They say that the armor makes you strong
I might be safe but I'm all alone
Been hiding from the light for way too long
Tell me you can break this heart of stone
Tell me you can break it
I need you to break it
Tell me you can break this heart of stone
Tell me you can break it
I need you to break it
Tell me you can break this heart of stone

Only you can break it!
Only you can break it!
Only, only you can break it! (yeah)
Only you can break it
Only you can break it (only you)
Only you can break it, break it
(only only you can break it)
Only you can break it
Only you can break it (yeah)
Only you can break it, break it

I feel you close
You tryna get closer
I run away but you got devotion
Every day you are pursuing me
But I know that everybody can see
But I'm pushing everybody away
I push you away 'cause I'm afraid
Afraid that my heart might get broken again
I'm afraid that you're gonna see all of my sin
Now let's sit back and imagine for a second
Life ain't been a bed of roses for the record
Heartbreak after heartbreak, what's next?
Heartache after heartache I'm stressed
With you is where my heart belongs
You're the reason I'm writing this song
So I give it over my heart of stone
Take it and break it and make it your home

They say that the armor makes you strong
I might be safe but I'm all alone
Been hiding from the light for way too long
Tell me you can break this heart of stone
Tell me you can break it
I need you to break it
Tell me you can break this heart of stone
Tell me you can break it
I need you to break it
Tell me you can break this heart of stone"
