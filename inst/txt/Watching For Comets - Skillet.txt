"1" "Watching For Comets
Skillet

[verse 1]
You burn so bright, I see stars
The way that you laugh,
It's like a heavenly choir
You made me feel invincible
When you're with me,
I can take on the world

[chorus]
You were a comet and I lost it
Watching for comets, will I see you again?
You burn so bright,
You burn me up tonight
[verse 2]
Say my name, I'll be there
I didn't know,
You should've said that you cared
It's not too late for broken hearts
Take my hand, make a wish on a star

[chorus]
You were a comet and I lost it
Watching for comets, will I see you again?
Everybody needs someone
But they can't feel like this
How can I breathe with this burning in my chest?
You were gone so fast, I want you back
You burn so bright,
You burn me up tonight
You were a comet and I lost it
(time to spread my wings and fly)
Watching for comets, will I see you again?
(time to fly away so high)

[bridge]
Now I see you, I'm frozen in time
All your colors burst into life
I don't dare close my eyes
Cause a love like this
Happens once in a lifetime

[chorus]
You were a comet and I lost it
Watching for comets, will I see you again?
Everybody needs someone
But they can't feel like this
How can I breathe with this burning in my chest?
You were gone so fast, I want you back
You were a comet and I lost it
(time to spread my wings and fly)
Watching for comets, will I see you again?
(time to fly away so high)
You burn so bright,
You burn me up tonight"
