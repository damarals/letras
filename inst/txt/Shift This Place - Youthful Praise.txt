"1" "Shift This Place
Youthful Praise

There's a cloud hovering over this place
And it's the weight, of glory
It's in the atmosphere,
Getting Misty in here
Let your weight, Fill this place

Troubles are only temporary
Glory, that's my remedy
Heartaches have got to cease
Glory, here comes my victory
Have your way, Fill this place

Vamp:
Glory, Have your way
Shift this place, with your weight

(repeat, modulate)"
