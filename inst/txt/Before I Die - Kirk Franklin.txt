"1" "Before I Die
Kirk Franklin

Brothers and sisters
I'm feelin' real good cuz it ain't over
Right before I die I gotta live

Live out my dreams
so I can be what He planned for me
not just for me but so they can see
much more of Him and less of
right before I die I gotta

Love my enemies, forgive the past
and set 'em free so I can free
free up the things
every blessing God has for me
see it's for me, not just for you
I had to learn from what I've been through
I can't go through that way again
be hurt by you that way again
It's not the end

I used to be afraid to die
I used to be afraid to try
cause I was too afraid of knowing
what failing looked like
but the son came to give me life
now I feel like I can touch the sky
I'm ready if you're ready

Get up and live right now, right now, right now
right now, right now, right now, right now
Get up and live right now, right now, right now
right now, right now, right now, right now
right now, right now, right now, right now

Right before I die I gotta

Change

change how I think
change how I speak
I'm not the same
so when I speak
you don't hear the pain
no longer weak
with no one to
right before I die I gotta

Become more like you
take up my cross
to count the cost
cause I was lost
that's why I praise you
you're the only God
I don't know what they do
But I know I used to be afraid to die

So the next time you think of me
and you wonder where I would be
without each blessing that helped me to see
life is much more than things
and how you live is more than how you sing
when I die what did I really mean, I mean,

Say what? Say what now?
As we proceed, to give you what you need
somebody, anybody, everybody, scream

Lord have mercy
I told you it ain't over for you
I see you livin'
I see you makin' it
Right before I live I have to die."
