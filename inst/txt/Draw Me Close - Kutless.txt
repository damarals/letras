"x"
"1" "Draw Me Close
Kutless

Draw me close to you
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear you say that I'm your friend

Help me find a way
To bring me back to you

Chorus:
You're all I want,
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want,
Help me know you are near

You are my desire
No one else will do
Cause no one else
Can take you place
To feel the warmth of Your embrace

Help me find a way
To bring me back to you

You're all I want,
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want,
Help me know you are near
