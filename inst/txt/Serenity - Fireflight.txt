"1" "Serenity
Fireflight

The light behind your eyes
tells Me that you've cried
sometime tonight
I offer down My hand
but without your plans
you cannot hide

The white snow falls
I cannot see
on my black heart--in front of me
say it to me in a way that I can understand

I hear You call----loud and clear
It melts my heart---take my fear
show me how to see the love that brings serenity

IÂ’m pouring out my love
open up your hands
not big enough
You tried to do it all
it's time for you to fall
you've done enough

Oh my God I've worked so hard
I've gotten nowhere"
