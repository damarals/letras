"1" "Glass House
Red

We deceive the world with lies we hide
Behind the smiles
We conceal a home of desperate hearts
The truth has fallen down
This illusion we've become
A fear we can't outrun
We're closing in our emptiness
We're broken

You alone, you can see right through
This glass house we call home
You alone, you can take away the pain
You have shown, you can break right through
This glass house of our souls
Make us whole again, make us whole

We fight to cover up the stars
From our charade
There's a war between who we are
And who we make-believe
It's over now, we're fallen' but

You alone, you can see right through
This glass house we call home
You alone, you can take away the pain
You have shown, you can break right through
This glass house of our souls
Make us whole again, make us whole

I, I'm running to escape the walls
That have trapped this hurt inside
The door is open, please come save me
I, I never wanted to hide behind
The disguise that I've become
That I've become

Cause you alone, you can take away the pain
Yea you have shown, you can find a way to change
Yea you alone, you can see right through
This glass house of our souls

Make us whole again(3x)"
