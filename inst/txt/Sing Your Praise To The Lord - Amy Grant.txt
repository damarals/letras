"1" "Sing Your Praise To The Lord
Amy Grant

Sing your praise to the Lord,
Come on everybody,
Stand up and sing...one more
Hallelujah,
Give your praise to the Lord,
I can never tell you,
Just how much good...that it's
Gonna do ya

Just to sing...anew...
The song your heart first learned to sing when He
First gave His life...to you...
The life goes on and so must the song,
You gotta sing...again...
The song born in your soul when you
First gave your heart...to Him...
Sing His praises, once more

Sing your praise to the Lord,
Come on everybody,
Stand up and sing...one more
Hallelujah,
Give your praise to the Lord,
I can never tell you,
Just how much good...that it's
Gonna do ya

Just to sing...aloud...
The song that someone is dying to hear
Down in the madd'ning crowd...
As you once were before your heard the song,
You gotta let them know...
The truth is a life to shine upon the way,
So maybe they...can go...
Sing His praises, once more

Sing your praise to the Lord,
Come on everybody,
Stand up and sing...one more
Hallelujah,
Give your praise to the Lord,
I can never tell you,
Just how much good...that it's
Gonna do ya

Just to let the name of the Lord...
Be praise, both for now, and evermore,
Praise Him all ye servants,

Give Him praise to the Lord,
Come on everybody,
Stand up and sing...one more
Hallelujah,
Give your praise to the Lord,
I can never tell you,
Just how much good...that it's
Gonna do ya

Just to sing, sing sing...
Come on, sing, sing, sing...
I can hear you now, sing, sing, sing...
