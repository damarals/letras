Casting Crowns

We were made to be courageous
We were made to lead the way
We could be the generation
That finally breaks the chains

We were made to be courageous
We were made to be courageous

We were warriors on the front lines
Standing, unafraid
But now we're watchers on the sidelines
While our families slip away

Where are you, men of courage?
You were made for so much more
Let the pounding of our hearts cry
We will serve the Lord

We were made to be courageous
And we're taking back the fight
We were made to be courageous
And it starts with us tonight

The only way we'll ever stand
Is on our knees, we're lifting hands
Make us courageous
Lord, make us courageous

This is our resolution
Our answer to the call
We will love our wives and children
We refuse to let them fall

We will reignite the passion
That we buried deep inside
May the watchers become warriors
Let the men of God arise

We were made to be courageous
And we're taking back the fight
We were made to be courageous
And it starts with us tonight

The only way we'll ever stand
Is on our knees, we're lifting hands
Make us courageous
Lord, make us courageous

Seek justice
Love mercy
Walk humbly with your God

Seek justice.
Love mercy
Walk humbly with your God

In the war of the mind I will make my stand
(Seek justice. Love mercy. Walk humbly with your God)
In the battle of the heart and the battle of the hand
(Seek justice. Love mercy. Walk humbly with your God)

In the war of the mind I will make my stand
(Seek justice. Love mercy. Walk humbly with your God)
In the battle of the heart and the battle of the hand
(Seek justice. Love mercy. Walk humbly with your God)

We were made to be courageous
And we're taking back the fight
We were made to be courageous
And it starts with us tonight

The only way we'll ever stand
Is on our knees, we're lifting hands
Make us courageous
Lord, make us courageous

We were made to be courageous
In the war of the mind I will make my stand
(Seek justice. Love mercy. Walk humbly with your God)

Lord, make us courageous
In the war of the mind I will make my stand
(Seek justice. Love mercy. Walk humbly with your God)

We were made to be courageous
In the war of the mind I will make my stand
(Seek justice. Love mercy. Walk humbly with your God)

Lord, make us courageous
In the war of the mind I will make my stand
(Seek justice. Love mercy....)
Walk humbly with your God"
