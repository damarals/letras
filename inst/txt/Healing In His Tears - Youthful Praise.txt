"1" "Healing In His Tears
Youthful Praise

Jeesus cried for my pain
Removed agony and strain
Lent His ear to my fear
There's healing in His tears
There's healing in His tears
Being both God and man
Who better would understand
Thatn the one who comforts me
And who died to set me free
Just like He cried for Lazurus
Still today He cares for us
And when Jesus feels your pain
Nothing in yoru life remains the same
Healing, healing, healing, healing, oh
Oh, oh, oh healing"
