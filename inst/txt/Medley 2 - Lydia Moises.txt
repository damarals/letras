Softly And Tenderly Jesus Is Calling

Softly and Tenderly Jesus is Calling
Calling for you and for me
See, on the portals
He is waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me
Come home, come home
You who are weary, come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh sinner, come home!

Nearer, My God To Thee

There in my Father? s home, safe and at rest
There in my Savior? s love, perfectly blest
Age after age to be, nearer my God to Thee
Still all my songs shall be, nearer, my God to Thee

The Battle Hymn Of The Republic

My eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
Of His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on

Glory, Glory Hallelujah
Glory, Glory Hallelujah
Glory, Glory Hallelujah
His truth is marching on
His truth is marching on
Hallelujah!"
