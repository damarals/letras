"1" "My Heart Sings Praise
Hillsong United

My heart sings praises
Each time I say Your name
This love is deeper
Than simple words can say
You go before me
You make a perfect way
My one desire
Is to give You perfect praise

In my heart
You are the power
In my night
Never failing light
With every breath that I take
I'll declare the things You've done
In my mind
Mighty Overcomer
In my soul
The reason why
In my life
You are the fire that calls me on"
