"1" "Have Thine Own Way, Lord
MÃºsicas Gospel

Have Thine own way, Lord
Have Thine own way
Thou are the potter
I am the clay
Mold me and make me
After Thy will
While I am waiting
Yielded and still

Have Thine own way, Lord
Have Thine own way
Search me and try me
Master today
Whiter than snow, Lord
Wash me just now
As in Thy presence
Humbly I bow

Have Thine own way, Lord
Have Thine own way
Wounded and weary
Help me I pray
Power all power surely is Thine
Touch me and heal me
Savior divine"
