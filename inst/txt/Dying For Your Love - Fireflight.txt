"1" "Dying For Your Love
Fireflight

I'm dark inside, it's where I hide
I lie in waiting, never changing
I'm the only one to blame
You pull me through the pain I choose
I'm calling to you, be my rescue
I'm the only one to blame

(I've betrayed) you're still waiting
(turned away) always waiting
Wherever I hide you always find me
(push and shove) you still love me
(self destruct) always love me
Please take my control
I am dying for your love

A ray of light cuts through the night
Fire burning, never changing
You're the only hope for me
Now I'm awake, don't want to wait
I'm reaching for you, I know I have to
You're the only hope for me

(I've betrayed) you're still waiting
(turned away) always waiting
Wherever I hide you always find me
(push and shove) you still love me
(self destruct) always love me
Please take my control
I am dying for your love

If I run to the ends of the earth you will find me
(when I fight you, you hold me more tightly)
There is no escape from your love

(I've betrayed) you're still waiting
(turned away) always waiting
Wherever I hide you always find me
(push and shove) you still love me
(self destruct) always love me
Please take my control
I am dying for your love"
