"1" "I Will Praise You (psalm 42)
Vineyard

Alone in the silence
Lord I can feel You all around me
All around me
Deep calls to deep in the roar of the waters
All of Your waves have crashed over me
Lord I can feel You
Like many waters
Flood over me (5x)

Why are you so downcast oh my soul
I will yet praise Him
My Savior, my King
Why are you so downcast oh my soul
Raise Your voice and sing
Put Your hope in Him"
