"1" "The Change In Me
Casting Crowns

Your Spirit is a gentleman
Standing at my hidden doors within
Where You wait for me to let You in
So You can set me free

Your Spirit is a wrecking ball
Tearing through my rebel walls
One by one I watch them fall
'Til You are all I see

Oh, You're the life in me
Oh, You're the air I breathe
Oh, You're the change in me
You're the change in me

Your Spirit is a whispering
When all the lies are deafening
You speak to the very heart of me
And fear cannot remain

Your Spirit is the light ahead
Calling me into the depths
And daring me to take a step
And let You lead the way

Oh, You're the life in me
Oh, You're the air I breathe
Oh, You're the change in me
You're the change in me

Your Spirit is a holy flame
Burning all the old away
Here I am, Lord, have Your way
'Til all that's left is You
All that's left is You

Oh, You're the life in me
Oh, You're the air I breathe
Oh, You're the change in me
You're the change in me

Your Spirit is my constant friend
You're with me to the very end
I'll never be alone again
You're the change in me"
