"x"
"1" "What The World Will Never Take
Hillsong United

With all I'm holding inside
With all my hopes and desires
And all the dreams that I've dreamt
With all I'm hoping to be
And all that the world will bring
And all that fails to compare

You say You want all that for me
I wouldn't have it any other way

CHORUS:
I've got a Saviour and He's living in me
WHOA
I wanna know
I wanna know You today
And You're the best thing that has happened to me
And the world will never take
The world will never take You away

With all I'm hoping to be
And all that the world will bring
And all that fails to compare

You say You want all that for me
I wouldn't have it any other way

Chorus 4x

No-one could ever take You away
No-one could ever take You away"
