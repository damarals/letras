Vineyard

Bow before the Lord
He reigns in majesty
Kneel before the throne
Of the mighty King of kings
He is the Holy Lamb
He is the Great I Am
And his righteousness
Will shine forevermore

The heavens are declaring
The glory of his name
The earth and sky proclaim
That He is Lord
The heavens are declaring
The glory of our great and awesome God

Bow before the Lord,
He reigns in sovereignty
Kneel before the throne
Of our eternal King
Bow before the Lord
Who triumphed mightily
Kneel before the throne
Of our victorious King

Death could not hold him
Death could not keep him bound
the power of darkness crumbled
When he rose"
