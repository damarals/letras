Skillet

Talking to God
Hearing what he wants
He moves in violence
I stand in silence

Who can question You, who can fathom You?
In your presence, who can stand?
Worlds spin around and kings crumble down
There's no escape what YouÃ­ve planned

Winds approaching, clouds are forming
God in his power
Is swirling around me
Calling me, and you know my name
So jump in or be taken, yea I can't
Run long enough, or go far enough
To escape the screaming rain

It's alright
It's alright
Jump in the whirlwind
I'm letting go (repeat)

My world's at stake
I want to break
Stop the striving
Start the dying
I'm thrown into it
It's so imminent
There's no arguing what You say
I gotta keep fanning it, I keep fanning it
I keep fanning the fire to flames

It's alright
It's alright
Jump in the whirlwind
I'm letting go (repeat twice)

Master and Savior, Sustainer and Creator
You move in power
And winds and thunder

It's alright
It's alright
Jump in the whirlwind
Letting go
Letting go - I'm letting go
