"1" "Timeless
Selah

Time, it’s changing me
It’s hard to see who I am
Touched, I’m touched by many things
So many things I don’t understand

But seasons pass and I discover
Above all this there’s another
Helping me to hold on to what is timeless

chorus:
So the autumn can color me gold
And the winter can dress me in snow
But it’s You I see
The timeless part of me
In the springtime I’m young once again
In the summer I dance on the wind
But it’s You I see
The timeless part of me

Change, whether it’s good or bad
You know I’m glad You’re in control
Oh, Lord, if I don’t understand
I know Your hand will shield my soul

Seasons pass and I discover
Above all this there’s another
Helping me to hold on to what is timeless

(chorus)"
