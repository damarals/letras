"1" "Be Still
Newsboys

be still and know He
know He is holy
be still and know He is God
we have our lives with inventions
that have hurried us nowhere fast
now we need to turn our attentions
to what will last
Chorus
be still and know He
know He is holy
be still and know He is God
love Him more dearly
see Him more clearly
be still and know He is God
we've been running without a direction
we're afraid to get there late
what we need is strength just to kneel down
and wait"
