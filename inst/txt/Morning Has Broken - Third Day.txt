"1" "Morning Has Broken
Third Day

Morning has broken, like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken, like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for the springing fresh from the word

Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven
Like the first dew fall, on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where his feet pass

Morning has broken, like the first dawn
Sing hallelujah, a new day is born

Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning
Born of the one light, Eden saw play
Praise with elation, praise every morning
God's recreation of the new day

Morning has broken, like the first dawn
Sing hallelujah, a new day is born

Morning has broken
Morning has broken"
