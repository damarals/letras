P.O.D.

It goes one for the money homie, two for the show.
We tore the roof off this mother now it's time to blow.
Like we don't need no water, don't bother, we let it burn.
We keep the fire just a little bit hotter, that way you'll learn.
Respect I earned, started with the clique that i hanged.
Respect I earned, ever since i got in this game.
Respect I earned, never wanting fortune or fame.
I'd rather have these south Diego streets knowin my name.

Chiggy-check, microphone check.
Chiggy-check, microphone check.
It's Lights Out, Game Over.
If you wanna you can check my stats.
It's Lights Out, Game Over.
Make way cause the kings is back.

We bang boogy through your system, subliminal.
We lyrical murderin like we criminals.
It's life or death, medical decision.
We so dope out the lab that you need a prescription.
The hood is listenin, so for you that i wrote this.
Keep it underground, stickin to the streets like the homeless.
With the dopeness, recognize the real P.O.D.
Cause we triple O, oh triple, triple OG.
