Switchfoot

When the things that you can't hold on to
Are the things that you wish you could keep
Are you really ready to pay for love
If it costs you everything?

All of God's children
All of God's children
Shining underneath
Shining underneath

I believe in a world that's beyond me
I believe in a world I ain't seen
Past the glass, and shotgun shacks
And violent, faceless, racist facts
I believe in a world that's made clean

All of God's children
All of God's children
Shining underneath
Shining underneath

Ohhhh, yeeeaaahhhh
Underneath it all
Underneath these scars
Underneath it all
Underneath our walls
Underneath it all
Underneath the bullet holes
Underneath it all
We still don't know who we are
It's shining underneath
It's shining underneath

Is there a well that won't run empty?
Is there a friend that can't be bought?
You'll find them when you're thirsty
Learn the lesson that can't be taught

All of God's children
All of God's children
Shining underneath
Shining underneath"
