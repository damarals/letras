"1" "Aleluya To Our God
Marcos Witt

Let every nation
And those who fear him
Let all generation
Sing their praises to our God

For He is holy
Ablaze in Glory
Let all generation
Sing their praises to our God

(chorus)
Aleluya, alelyua, aleluya
To our God

We'll give Him Glory
We'll give Him honor
We will worshisp forever
Giving praises to the Lamb

His throne is eternal
Righteous and holy
We'll cry out to the nations
Give your praises to our God

(brigde)
There's a great multitude
Making sounds as the thunder of heaven

It's the voice of our praise
Lifted up in worship to God

From the north and the south
We'll declare His Glory forever
He's the Lord of all lords
The Almighty King of all kings"
