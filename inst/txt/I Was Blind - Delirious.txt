Delirious

I love your ways
They are beautiful
so beautiful to me
Your mystery
How you know me, yet you love me
Your kindness, it brings me to my knees
Your kindness, it leads me to say sorry

I was blind, but now I see
I was broken but you carried me
I was lost, but now I’m found
I was guilty but you turned me around

I love your ways
They are beautiful
so beautiful to me
I love your mystery
How you trust me yet you know me …
Your kindness, it brings me to my knees
Your kindness, it leads me to say sorry

Let it shine on me,
Let it shine on us,
Would you shine on us."
