Jeremy Camp

hungry I come to You
for I know You satisfy
I am empty
but I know Your love does not run dry
so I wait for You
so I wait for You

chorus
I'm falling on my knees
offering all of me
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for

broken I run to You
for Your arms are open wide
I am weary but I know Your touch restores my life
so I wait for You
so I wait for You

when I'm falling on my knees
offering all of me
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for
Oh, when I'm falling on my knees
offering all of me
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for

so I wait for you
so I wait for you
so I wait for you
for You!

I'm falling on my knees
offering all of me
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for
Oh, when I'm falling on my knees
offering all of me
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for
