"1" "If You Only Knew
Take 6

She wants to break the silence
She's tired of always hiding
Afraid that she'll be looked upon with shame
Instead she goes on hurting
She knows it isn't working
How much longer does she have to bear the pain

Channel:
What If I told you
Somewhere Someone really cares
And the same Someone is always waiting to hear from you
Would you believe that Someone loved you so much
He sacrificed His life and all for you
Oh my, my If you only knew

Chorus:
If you only knew yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you hade a clue yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you only knew yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you only knew yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

He's a man who thinks he's something
Love to him means nothing
As captain of his ship he stands alone
But inside there's something missing
It seems his ship is sinking
How much longer can he make it on his own

Chorus

Bridge:
Would you go and thell somebody else
What he's live with Him in paradise

Vamp:
If you only knew yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you hade a clue yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm waiting to hear from you yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I pour out all heaven for you yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you only knew yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I gave up my Son for you yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Someone cares for you yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes I do, if you only knew yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you only knew yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And if you only knew"
