"1" "One Desire
Hillsong United

You gave it all for me
My soul desire
My everything
And all I am is devoted to You

How could I fail to see
You are the love that rescued me
And all I am is devoted to You
And oh, how could I not be moved
Lord here with You
So have your way in me

â€˜Cause Lord there is just one thing
That I will seek
This is my cry
My one desire
Just to be where You are Lord
Now and forever
It's more than a song
My one desire
Is to be with you
Is to be with You, Jesus

The one thing
The one thing I ask
Is to be with You"
