"1" "Fly Away
Take 6

A day is comin' and it won't be long
I'll fly away to my home
I'll be so happy
I'll sing a new song
I'll fly away to my home
No more pain no more sorrow
No more crying and no tomorrow
I'll fly away to my home

When-a de time come, When-a de time come
I'll fly away to my home
When-a de time come, When-a de time come
I'll fly away to my home

Chorus:
When-a de time come, When-a de time come
When-a de time come, When-a de time come
When-a de time come, When-a de time come
I'll fly away to my home

Maybe de mornin'
Maybe de evenin'
I'll fly away to my home
Maybe de noonday
But soon I'll be leavin'
I'll fly away to my home"
