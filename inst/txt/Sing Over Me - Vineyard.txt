"1" "Sing Over Me
Vineyard

You come close to the broken hearted
You draw near to the crushed in spirit
Sing Your songs of healing over me

So sing over me Jesus touch me with Your hand
Sing over me Jesus like only You can
Sing Your songs of healing over me

I am satis.ed with nothing less
To feel the closeness of Your breath
So sing Your songs healing over me"
