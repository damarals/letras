"1" "This Is Now
Casting Crowns

Standing at the water's edge
I dropped my dreams when I dropped my nets
No hesitation no regrets
I followed you but that was then and this is now

You washed my feet and you changed my name
I swore I'd never be the same
But just like the tides I guess people change
'Cause that was then and this is now

I wish I could go back but I don't know how
I remember when I stood my ground
I swore I'd never let you down
I want to be that man again
But that was then and this now

I watched the blind man lift his head
And look his savor in the eyes
I heard a dead man take a breath
Dropped to my knees as I watched him rise

And I felt the sea beneath my feet
As I stepped out on the angry waves
But you saw the storm raging within
You reached out and calmed me then but this is now

I wish I could go back but I don't know how
I remember when I stood my ground
I swore I'd never let you down
I want to be that man again
But that was then and this now

Just when I thought my sin had closed the door
I see my savor standing on the shore
With arms wide open
Just like the first time you called my name
You said that was then and this is now

My child I bore your cross
I wore your crown
When you couldn't come to me my love came down
So take my hand I'll lead you out
'Cause that was then and this is now

My child I bore your cross
I wore your crown
When you couldn't come to me my love came down
So take my hand I'll lead you out
You'll never be that man again
'Cause that was then and this is now"
