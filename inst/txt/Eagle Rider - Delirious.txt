"x"
"1" "Eagle Rider
Delirious

I feel the spirits breath moving down my neck
Closer than a summers day
You’re a lion on my back
I hear the spirit speak whispering my name
Gentle as a butterfly
In a violent hurricane

I feel the spirits breath free me from the net
Flying from captivity
And the life I called a wreck
I hear the spirit speak a voice behind my eyes
It’s time for a brand new song to sing
Now I’m saying my goodbyes

I’m an eagle rider flying on your wings
And you take me higher to your beauty I will cling
I’m an eagle rider when I fly above the winds
And I’m climbing higher, so much higher than I’ve been

I see the world below spinning in the breeze
The giants seem much smaller here
Now I’m living in my dreams
I love the spirit’s voice it’s teaching me to fly
It’s time for a rediscovery
As I fall into the sky

I’m Going up, not coming down, I’m Going up, not coming down.
Hello, hello, goodbye."
