"1" "The Love Of God
Gaither Vocal Band

The love of God has been extended to a fallen race
Through Christ, the savior of all men, there's hope in saving grace (saving grace).

The love of God is greater far than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star, and covers all the world.
Its power is eternal (eternal), its glory is supernal (supernal)
When all this Earth shall pass away there'll always be the love of God.

It goes beneath the deepest stain that sin could ever leave
Redeeming souls to live again, who will on Christ believe (will believe).

The love of God is greater far than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star, and covers all the world.
Its power is eternal (eternal), its glory is supernal (supernal)
When all this Earth shall pass away there'll always be the love of God."
