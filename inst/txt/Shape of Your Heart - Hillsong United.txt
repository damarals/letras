"1" "Shape of Your Heart
Hillsong United

There's a light hanging over me
There's a beam running way down
Turning sorrow to ecstasy
As the dust comes to life

See the shape of your heart
Where the margins collide
There's a life hanging over me, over me
Where your love crossed the lines

There's a love hanging over me
There's a beam running way down
In the shadow of mystery
Where my soul comes alive

See the shape of your heart
Where the margins collide
There's a life hanging over me, over me
Where your love crossed the lines

You run deep like the wildest heavens
You run deep like the wild in me
You run wild like que four horizons
You run wide enough to cover me

How I love you Jesus
I will worship you
I will worship you Jesus
Higher than anything I see
More than the air I breathe
I need you

See the shape of your heart
Where the margins collide
There's a life hanging over me, over me
Where your love crossed the lines

You run deep like the wildest heavens
You run deep like the wild in me
You run wild like que four horizons
You run wide enough to cover me

There's a cross hanging over me
There's a fire burning inside out
As the world comes to life in me
In the shape of your heart"
