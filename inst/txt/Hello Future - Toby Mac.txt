"1" "Hello Future
Toby Mac

Hello sunshine, goodbye rain
Hello promise, I hope you're here to stay
Ain't nothing sweeter than welcoming new mercy everyday
Hello sunshine, sure glad you came, sure glad you came

Well, hello future, goodbye yesterday
Your grass is greener than anywhere I've laid
You turn these troubled eyes
To watching all my troubles wash away
Hello future, we gon' be ok, we gon' be ok

Hello purpose, how you've alluded me
I thought I'd find you in victory
I scaled the mountain just to find nobody beside me
Hello purpose, don't leave me be, don't leave me be

Hello Jesus, I hope You understand
My last departure was never planned
I came up empty with everyone and everywhere I've been
Hello Jesus, I'm home again, I'm home again"
