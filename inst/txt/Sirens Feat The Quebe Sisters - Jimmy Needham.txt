"1" "Sirens (Feat. The Quebe Sisters)
Jimmy Needham

Have you ever made a promise
You wanted to keep
But keeping up with promises
Was never too easy
So you thought maybe if you tried hard
Maybe if you're die hard
Maybe you could win one game
For the team

But the voice of an angel
Was singing a song
You hardly noticed you're singing along
Before you really knew what hit
You were on a sinking ship
Just another sailor that's
Lost at sea

Your knuckles are white but
The harder you try you're
Still losing the fight
Just wondering why
Why can't I

Silence the Sirens
I hear 'em
They're singing
I feel it pulling me under
Silence the Sirens
Rid their throats of poison notes
And sing a better song for me

Like showing up with a knife to a nuke war
I never knew what I was in for
Pull the ripcord
Plane's going down
Six feet down
Underground
Never make a sound no more

Like putting a monster inside of a cage
Lock it all up but it can't do a thing
Gonna be free
Free anyway
Begging for grace
Sing a new song
A beautiful song
Right now I'm needing You to

Silence the Sirens
I hear' em
They're singing
I feel it pulling me under
Silence the Sirens
Rid their throats of poison notes
And sing a better song for me

A hundred thousand voices
Ringin in my ears
The only hope for me is You
I hear them singing now
I need to hear You louder
Drown them out before they drown me too

Silence the Sirens
I hear' em
They're singing
I feel it pulling me under
Silence the Sirens
Rid their throats of poison notes
And sing
And sing
Silence the Sirens
I hear' em
They're singing
I feel it pulling me under
Silence the Sirens
Rid their throats of poison notes
And sing a better song for me"
