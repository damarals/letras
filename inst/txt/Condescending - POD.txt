P.O.D.

And this is not pretend,
And you have no reason to feel secure,
Cause this world, It waits for no one.
So don't you fool yourself,
Get out of this imaginary place you call
Reality, it's so deceiving.

You don't get it your way.
Your so Condescending.
We don't do what you say.
Your so unforgiving.

So tell me once again,
How easy it would be if we'd listened,
To you, your paying attention.
So what's the point in you,
Showing us the way if we don't even care,
To be like you, or even know you.

You don't get it your way.
Your so Condescending.
We don't do what you say.
Your so unforgiving.

You don't get it your way.
Your so Condescending.
We don't do what you say.
Your so unforgiving.

Who's that?
Who's that?
Who's that?

I won't do what you say!
I can't do it your way!
I won't do what you say!
I can't do it your way!

You don't get it your way.
Your so Condescending.
We don't do what you say.
Your so unforgiving.

You don't get it your way.
Your so Condescending.
We don't do what you say.
Your so unforgiving.

Your patronizing,
Your overbearing,
And your so unbending.
Who won't do it your way,
I won't do what you say.
I can't do it your way.
I won't do what you say.
You don't understand me.
I won't do it your way."
