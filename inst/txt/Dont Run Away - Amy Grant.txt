"1" "Don't Run Away
Amy Grant

(Tell me) Does your head keep turning,
From the feelings churning,
Deep inside of you?
(Tell me) When your mind is racing,
All the things you're chasing,
Worth your while, well?
(Tell me) Don't you ever question
Why you're always guessin'
Reasons for your life?
(Listen) There's no need to waver,
Long ago the Savior,
Died...for you, so,

Don't run away,
You're headed no where, (Don't run away....)
Keep up the face,
You're gonna go there, (Keep up the face.)
You'll feel alone,
Who do you know there?
Please turn back now.

Don't run away,
He wants your heart now, (Don't run away....)
Hear what I say,
And play it smart now, (What I say....)
Wise up today,
And give Him all of your love....

(Tell me) Does the fear of losing
Keep your heart from choosing
Who has hold of you?
(Tell me) Have you felt the yearning,
Deep inside, a burning
Need for love, now?
(Tell me) Tell me, can you sense a fighting?
Hate is now igniting,
Fear of loving you.
(Listen) Listen, God is still here waiting;
He'll remove the hating
Part...of you, so,

Don't run away,
You're headed no where, (Don't run away....)
Keep up the face,
You're gonna go there, (Keep up the face.)
You'll feel alone,
Who do you know there?
Please turn back now.

Don't run away,
He wants your heart now, (Don't run away....)
Hear what I say,
And play it smart now, (What I say....)
Wise up today,
And give Him all of your love....

Don't run away,
You're headed no where, (Don't run away....)
Keep up the face,
You're gonna go there, (Keep up the face.)
You'll feel alone,
Who do you know there?
Please turn back now.

Don't run away,
He wants your heart now, (Don't run away....)
Hear what I say,
And play it smart now, (What I say....)
Wise up today,
And give Him all of your love....

Don't run away,
You're headed no where, (Don't run away....)
Keep up the face,
You're gonna go there, (Keep up the face.)
You'll feel alone,
Who do you know there?
Please turn back now.

Don't run away,
He wants your heart now, (Don't run away....)
Hear what I say,
And play it smart now, (What I say....)
Wise up today,
And give Him all of your love....
