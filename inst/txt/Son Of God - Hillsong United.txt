Hold my hand and walk with me
You’re the light that makes me see
On this path my soul You lead
O my shepherd walk with me

I need You more than breath
You’re my hope in You I live
Angels worship at Your throne
Power and glory to You alone

My Savior
Glorious One
My Redeemer
Living in my heart
Now and forever
Your Kingdom come
Jesus Son of God
Jesus, Son of God

Jesus, O Jesus.
Holy is the Lamb of God
Jesus, O Jesus
Worthy is the Lamb of God"
