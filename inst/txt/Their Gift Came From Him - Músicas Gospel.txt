"1" "Their Gift Came From Him
MÃºsicas Gospel

For those who achieve,
And receive some fame.
They're richly rewarded,
They get a famous name.

But do they respect,
The one's honoring them.
Are they thankful to God?
Their gift came from him.

Chorus:
They could spend their money,
And help those with needs.
They could show they're thankful,
For all they've received.
But there are so many,
Who satisfies whims,
And they soon forget,
Their gift came from him.

Their fans worship them,
And do the things they do.
So that makes them responsible,
For where the fans are led to.

On their judgement day,
Will they like what they see?
Or will they feel ashamed,
They have caused misery.

Chorus:
They could spend their money,
And help those with needs.
They could show they're thankful,
For all they've received.
But there are so many,
Who satisfies whims,
And they soon forget,
Their gift came from him."
