"1" "As Wonderful As You
Vineyard

In all the earth there's nothing greater
Than the love You offer me
And if I searched more than a lifetime
I would fi nd there's no one like You
One as wonderful as You

The loveliest of all that I've found is You
The most beautiful sight ever seen is You
Bright morning star from heaven
The everlasting light, Jesus

The loveliest of all that I've found is You
The most beautiful sight ever seen is You
Your face outshines the sun
Your glory fi lls the skies, Jesus"
