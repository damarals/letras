"1" "On Jordans Stormy Banks I Stand
Youthful Praise

On Jordan's stormy banks I stand
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan's fair and happy land
Where my possessions lie
All o'er those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day
There God, the Son forever reigns
And scatters night away.
I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land
I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land
No chilling wind nor poisonous breath
Can reach that healthful shore
Where sickness, sorrow, pain and death
Are felt and feared no more
I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land
I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land
When shall I see that happy place
And be forever blessed
When shall I see my Father's face
And in His bosom rest
I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land
I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land"
