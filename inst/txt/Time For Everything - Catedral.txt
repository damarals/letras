"1" "Time For Everything
Catedral

Time to be born
And time todie
Time to plant
And time to aproch

Time to cry
And time to lauch
A time to win
And time to lose

And our time is just for love
Our time is just to live
With jesus christ we are the one
And he is ready to forgive

A time to tear
And time to sew
Time to be sorry
And time to speak
A time for war
And time for peace
And always
Time for everything"
