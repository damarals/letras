Chris Tomlin

[Chorus]
We are a chosen generation
Rise up holy nation
God, we live for You
You have called us out of darkness
and into light so glorious
God, we live for You

We live for You, We live for You

We run; With passion for Your Name; we run
Freedom; You've broken every chain; we run
Our God will not be moved
Our God will never be shaken
We run to You; We run...

Our God will not be moved
Our God will never be shaken
[x3]
We run to You; We run...

You are everything
More than all we need
God, we live for You; God, we live for You
I found this world to be not enough for me
God, we live for You; God, we live for You"
