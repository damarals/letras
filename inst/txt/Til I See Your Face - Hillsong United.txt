"1" "Til I See Your Face
Hillsong United

How my soul longs for the Lord
Yearns after Him, waits for the Lord
And my heart is lifted up to You
And until I see Your face
I will not give in

I will not give in longing for You Lord
I'll not be satisfied
Until I see your face

As the deer pants for the water
My soul is thirsty after You Lord
And as I live to draw near You
You'll draw near unto me

I will not give in longing for You Lord
I'll not be satisfied
Until I see your face
I will not give in longing for You Lord
I'll follow close behind
Until I see your face

And in the wilderness
I cannot see ahead
You tell me seek Your face Lord
And Your face I will seek

'Cause I will not give in longing for You Lord
I'll not be satisfied
Until I see your face
I will not give in yearning after You
I'll follow close behind
Until I see your face"
