Hillsong United

I'm living for this cause
I lay down my life into Your hands
I'm living for the truth
The hope of the world in You I'll stand
I'm living for this cause
I lay down my life into Your hands
I'm living for the truth
The hope of the world in You I'll stand
'Cause all I want is You

All I want is
All I want is You Jesus
All I want is
All I want is You Jesus
All I want is
All I want is You Jesus
All I want is
All I want is You Jesus



Here I am waiting
Abide in me I pray
Here I am longing
For You
Hide me in Your love
Bring me to my knees
May I know Jesus
More and more

Come live in me
All my life
Take over
Come breathe in me
I will rise
On eagle's wings



In this place
Dreams are made
In this place
Where You are
Carry me here
In Your arms of love
Draw me close to You
I want to be where You are
Carry me here
In Your arms of love
Draw me close to You
I want to be where You are
Where You are
Where You are
Carry me here
In Your arms of love
Draw me close to You
I want to be where You are
Carry me here
In Your arms of love
Draw me close to You
I want to be where You are
Where You are
Where You are
Where You are"
