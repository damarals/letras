I won't stay here another night
If I gotta sacrifice
Who I am on the inside
I'd rather be an outsider
And you can stay if you like
I'll see you on the other side
I wanna live the free life
I'd rather be an outsider

I really can't tell if I'm overdressed or I'm underdressed
If I'm underpaid or just overstressed
If I'm cynical or just over this
Cause I'm tired of tryna get over there
Man it's over there
Party's over
You probably couldn't tell we over here
Cause you hardly sober
Double shots of that ego
They laughin' at us, yeah we know
May be at the bottom but we not forgotten
The directors plotting that sequel
'Til then we live on the outside
And it might storm and we might die
But I'd rather go with my fist high
Standing outside of your inside
I tried my best to fit in
Looking for a suit to fit in
Standing outside of your prison
Tryna find ways I can get in
Now I realize that I'm free
And I realize that I'm me
And I found out that I'm not alone
'Cuz there's plenty people like me
That's right plenty people like me
All love me despite me
And all unashamed and all unafraid
To speak out for what we might see
I said there's plenty people like me
All outsiders like me
And all unashamed and all unafraid
To live out what they supposed to be
Outsiders

I know what they askin' fo'
I know what they askin' fo'
But how you gone cover charge me my life and soul
And then turn around and ask for mo'
Time to go plus the line is long
I'mma color the outside where lines are drawn
If you wanna exclude me for being the true me
It's Gucci
I already found my home
Homesick
Homeless if I'm honest
'Cuz my home is somewhere I ain't never been before
I'mma hone this here gift
Even if it doesn't fit in the box
That'll please these folks
Some of y'all gone need these quotes
I ain't tryna eat I'm tryna feed these folks
Martin, Mandella yeah we need these folks
We believe these folks
We could be these folks
But they want me to take an L
Tired of taking losses so they can call me a failure
I failed at being you
But I'm winning at being me
I'm winning at being free
Ain't no competition but me
See I realize that I'm free
And I realize that I'm me
And I found out that I'm not alone
And there's plenty people like me
I said there's plenty people like me
All outsiders like me
All unashamed and all unafraid
To live out what they supposed to be
Outsiders

It's been too dark
So many lies
Turn on the lights
Open your eyes
Oh oh oh oh
We'll be runnin' through the night
It's brighter on the other side
Oh oh oh oh
Something's bigger than you and I
Brighter on the other side"
