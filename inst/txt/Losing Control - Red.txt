"1" "Losing Control
Red

[Verse 1]
Just another caricature
See how temptation leads
It sells me the lies
like a sheep in disguise
With every word it plants another seed

[Verse 2]
I feel a change in the atmosphere
I never thought I'd end up back here
Divided, alone, afraid
In a breath my chains reappear

[Chorus]
And I build it all up
just to watch it fall down
(Nothing left to save, I'm letting go)
And I'm digging all up
What I've buried underground
I'm losing, I'm losing control
I'm losing control
I'm losing control

[Verse 3]
Just another thorn in my side
I try again and fail
I seal my fate, it's almost too late
I try to hold on
but it's slipping, slipping away

[Chorus]
And I build it all up
just to watch it fall down
(Nothing left to save, I'm letting go)
And I'm digging all up
What I've buried underground
I'm losing, I'm losing control
I'm losing control
I'm losing control

[Bridge]
Hold on to me, don't let me fall
'Cause I can't waste it all on nothing
Hold on to me, please don't let go
I'm losing everything

[Chorus]
And I build it all up
just to watch it crash down
(I'm losing everything!)
And I'm digging all up
what I buried underground
I'm losing, I'm losing control
I'm losing control
I'm losing control

Control
Control
Control
Control"
