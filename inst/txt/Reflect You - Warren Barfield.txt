"x"
"1" "Reflect You
Warren Barfield

I must admit there are two of me
Who I am and who want to be
one is strong, the other weak
Flesh and bone trying to believe

Show me who You are
want to see Your face, want to see Your face
Shine a ligth on this cold heart in this dark, dark place
Oh, You are the sun, I am the moon
And reflect You
I reflect You

Who I want to be looks a lot like You
Who I am has got work to do
Whatever it takes with You I belong
Show me the way, lord, lead me home

Show me who You are
want to see Your face, want to see Your face
Shine a ligth on this cold heart in this dark, dark place
Oh, You are the sun, I am the moon
And reflect You
I reflect You

You give my life its meaning
You are my reason for being
Without the son, I am cold and alone
Floating in the dark, floating in the dark

Show me who You are
want to see Your face, want to see Your face
Shine a ligth on this cold heart in this dark, dark place
Oh, You are the sun, I am the moon
And reflect You
I reflect You"
