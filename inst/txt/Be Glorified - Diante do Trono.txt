"1" "Be Glorified
Diante do Trono

Nobody sees me
I hear no praises
Even when nobody calls my name
Let my heart remain the same
Just givin' you glory

Behind the curtains
Out of the spotlights
In the depths of my heart
Be glorified

In every little thing I do
Let me do exalt to You
Be glorified
In my life be glorified
The honour that will never fade
Is the one You give until last day
Be glorified
In my life be glorified"
