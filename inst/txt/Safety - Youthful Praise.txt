Youthful Praise

He that dwelleth in the secret place
Of the most high God
Shall abide in His grace
And he that walketh through the valley of death
Shall in no wise be entangled by God's hand
He shall be kept
If I go into the heavens
He knows
If I go into the deepest depths
He knows
So no matter what may come my way
I'm covered by His blood
Even when satan seems to rage
From His hand I'm hidden safe
I'm in His safety
Dwell in His safety
The safety of the Lord
Nothing can stop me
Nor can you block me
Why because I'm in the safety of the Lord
Choir:
(unison)I'm in His (parts)safety
Dwell in His safety
The safety of the Lord
I'm in His safety
Dwell in His safety
The safety of the Lord
He is the captain of my soul
He is my fortress from all wrong
When the storms of life
Begin to rage in my life
I run into the master's arm
I'm in His safety (Repeat as directed)
End: I'm in His safety
Dwell in His safety
The safety of the Lord(Repeat as directed)"
