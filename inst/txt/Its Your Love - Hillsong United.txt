"1" "It's Your Love
Hillsong United

Upon the hill of Calvary
He came from heaven's throne
Our fallen-ness and mercy meet
Where blood and water flow

What grace divine
What selflesness
That Christ would
Bear the weight
Our proof is scarred
On hands that bled
That we were worth every nail

\"All the praise and glory to God
We sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
For the King has carried the cross
He is risen from the grave''

Beyond the tomb
To holy skies
He rose in victory
And bridged for us
The great divide
his life is our liberty

Your Love
Its your love
Its your love that has saved me
Its your blood, your blood
Its your blood that has claimed me"
