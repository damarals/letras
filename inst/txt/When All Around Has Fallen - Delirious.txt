"1" "When All Around Has Fallen
Delirious

When all around has fallen your castle has been burned
You used to be a king here now no one knows your name
You live your life for honour, defender of the faith
But you've been crushed to pieces and no knows your pain

Come, come lay your weary head be still my friend
Come, come rise I'll place my sword upon your shoulder
Come, rise with me

When tomorrow has been stolen and you can't lift your head
And summer feels like winter your heart is full of stone
Though ail your hopes have fallen
your skin is now your only armour
Wear your scars like medals defender of the faith

Come, come lay your weary head be still my friend
Come, come rise I'll place my sword upon your shoulder
Come, come lay your faithful head, be still my friend
Come rise with me"
