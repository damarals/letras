Don't Waste Your Life
[Intro]
Let's go
Don't waste your life, man

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I know a lot of people that scared they gone die
Couple of em thinking they'll be livin in the sky
While I'm here livin man I gotta ask why,
What am here fo I gotta figure out
Waste my Life no I gotta make it count
If Christ is real then what am I gone do about
Everything in Luke 12:15 down to 21
You really gotta go and check it out
Paul said if Christ ain't resurrect then we wasted our
lives
Well that implies that our life's built around Jesus
being alive
Everyday I'm living tryna show the world why
Christ is more than everything you'll ever cry
Better than pretty women and sinning and living to get a minute of
any women and men that you admire
It ain't to lie
We created for
Outta the dust he made us for him
Elects us and he saves us for him
Jesus comes and he raises for him
Magnify the Father why bother with something lesser
He made us so we could bless him
And to the World we confess him
Ressurects him
So i know i got life
Matter fact better then I know I got Christ
If you don't see his ways in my days and nights
You can hit my brakes you can stop my lights
Man I lost my rights
Lost my life
Forget the money cars and toss that ice
The cost is Christ
And they could never offer me anything on the planet
That'll cost that price (yeah!)

[2x Chorus: Cam]
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my...
Don't wanna waste my...

[Verse 2: Dwayne Tryumf]
Armed and dangerous
So the devil just can't hang wid us
Christian youth them a stand wid us
Livin' n driven give a vision fullfillin the
commission he handed us
London to Los Angeles Da rap evangelist
Ma daddy wouldn't abandon us
\"I gotta back pack fulla tracts plus I keep a Johnny
Mac\"
So are you ready to jam with us
So let's go
Gimme the world an(Let's go)
Persecution (Let's go)
Tribulation(Let's go)
Across the nation(Let's go)
Procrastination(Let's go)
Hung on the cross in the could
Died for da young and the old
Can't you never know
Heaven knows
How many souls are going to hell or to heaven
So we gotta go in and get em What!

[2x Chorus: Cam]
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my...
Don't wanna waste my...

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Suffer! Yeah do it for Christ
You trying to figure what to do with your life ?
You make a lot of money? Hope you doing it right
because the money is God you better steward it right
Stay focused! You ain't got no ride ?
Your life ain't wrapped up in what you drive
The clothes you wear, the job you work
The color your skin naw, you Christian first
People living life for a job make lil money,
Start living for a car get in a house a wife, kids and
dog
When then retire they living high on the hog
But guess what they didn't ever really live at all to
life is Christ yeah and that's Paul I recall
To die is gain so for Christ we give it all!
He's the treasure you'll never find in the mall
See your money, your singleness, marriage, talent,
your time
They were loaned to you to show the world that Christ
is Divine
That why it's Christ in my rhymes That why it's Christ
all the time
See my whole world is built around Him
He the life in my lines
I refused to waste my life he's too true chase that
ice
Heres my gifts and time cause I'm constantly trying to
be used to praise the Christ
If he truly raised this news should change your life
And by his grace you can put your faith in the pleace
that
Rules yours days and nights.

[2x Chorus: Cam]
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my...
Don't wanna waste my...
