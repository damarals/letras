"1" "Without Jah, Nothin'
P.O.D.

(Screaming)
One, Two, Three, Four.
Without Jah, Gonna Say, What you sayin up here.
Without Jah, But know it sucks boy. So something's here.
Now. Jump. Nothing to nothing. Who say you know you say.
What you say is without jah.
Jah. A lift off, a lift off.
Jah. Jah. You know you love it when you say Jah. Jah.
Without Jah, Without Jah. You know it's time for lift off.

(Singing)
Without Jah, Nothing nothing.
Without Jah, Without Jah, Nothing, Nothing.
Without Jah, Nothing.
With every-thing in bomb.
Let everything with loving. Oh Oh Ohhhhhh.
Without Jah. Something. Something.
Without Jah. Oh there is nothing, nothing.
Without Jah, Nothing. Something.
Without Jah, Nothing. Nothing.
Without Jah, nothing.

Walla la la la la la... this is the same.
Don't you know why there's so many men right here?
The baby long bar. BY HERE!
When you see with him each and every day.
They see you at Lithuania.
