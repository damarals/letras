"1" "Your Love Endures
Third Day

Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day

From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #13.

Though the treasures of
This life may fade
Your love endures forever
They will pass away Things that man has made
But your love endures forever

Now I can't explain, or even understand
Why you gave your life, to save sinful man
But I know it's true, I've seen it myself
Your love endures forever

Though the seasons change With the passing time
Your love endures forever
And the sun will fade If just for the night
Your love endures forever

Though our pains and joys Will come and go
Your love endures forever
Even in my fears I will always know
"
