"1" "Star Of The Show
Fireflight

I lost my way home
Looking at myself
Searching for nothing
I knew all along
Where I belong
Every day I
Stand in the light
I can take the stage
But you are the one
You give me the Love

You know what You are
You?re the star of the show
Cuz you are the one
I cannot breathe in, without a reason
You?re the star, You?re the star,
You?re the star

I?m coming home now,
closer to you
You show me the way,
You turn me into
Something that?s new

I thought that I knew You,
but I was only pushing You away,
Now I can hear you"
