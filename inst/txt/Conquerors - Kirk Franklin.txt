"1" "Conquerors
Kirk Franklin

Tomorrow is a brand new day
All my sins have been washed away
My hands are new
My life is free
My heart is pure
I've been redeemed (Oh yeah)
See I've seen his face, touched his hand
Finally, now I understand
Why he saved a wretch, a wretch like me
And by his blood I've been redeemed
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)

We ran the race
Kept the fight, (we kept the fight)
Shed our blood, (we shed our blood)

For what was right (for what was right)
We carried our cross (We carried our cross)
Through stormy weather (through storm and rain)
Because of Christ (because of Christ)
Now we can say (Now we can say)
That we are conquerors
See I know I know conquerors
We are conquerors
Conquerors

See I've seen his face, touched his hand
Finally, now I understand
Why he saved a wretch, saved a wretch like you and me
And by his blood I've been redeemed Oh yeah

We ran the race, (He ran the race)
Kept the fight, (we kept the fight)
We shed our blood, (we shed our blood)
For what was right (for what was right)
We carried our cross (We carried our cross)
Through stormy weather (through storm and rain)
Because of Christ (because of Christ)
Now we can say (Now we can say)
That we are conquerors
See I know I know conquerors
We are conquerors
Conquerors

For no matter what we go through Lord
I give my promise to you"
