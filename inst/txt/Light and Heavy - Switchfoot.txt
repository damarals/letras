Switchfoot

I'm on a roll
I'm feeling icarus
I might have flown too high
I'm not alone
I'm feeling icarus
I might have flown too high

Ariadne, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for
Ariadne, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for

Pick up the phone
Please tell me anything
Did you fly too high?
My baby's grown
Please tell me anything
You might have flown too high

Ariadne, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for
Ariadne, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for

On my pilgrimage, I'm traveling light with the heavy heart
On my pilgrimage, I'm traveling light and heavy, light and heavy, light and heavy

This is my torch to carry
More than just a cross to bury down
(Inaudible)
Extraordinarily, light and heavy

Ariadne, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for
Ariadne, I hope you find what you were looking for, looking for

Light and heavy"
