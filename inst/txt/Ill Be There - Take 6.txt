Take 6

Wherever you go
I want you to know
I'm a step ahead of you
And whatever you need
You can believe
What I say I'll do,
I'll do

I'll be there when you feel you can't go on
I'll be there when all hope is gone
I'll be there like a beacon in the night
I'll be there to make what's wrong right
I'll be there whenever you call
I'll be there to catch you when you fall
I'll be there to wipe all you raindrops away
Sunshine's on the way

Whenever it rains
I'll ease your pain
And chase the clouds away
Don't be afraid of
What you can't see
Jus call on Me
And I will laed rhe way

I'll be there when you feel you can't go on
I'll be there when all hope is gone
I'll be there like a beacon in the night
I'll be there to make what's wrong right
I'll be there whenever you call
I'll be there to catch you when you fall
I'll be there to wipe all you raindrops away
Sunshine's on the way

If you le Me the one
You don't have to run
I will take the fall for you
I love you and I will be there for you

And I will be there for you
I will be there for you if you let me
I will be there for you
Catch you when you fall"
