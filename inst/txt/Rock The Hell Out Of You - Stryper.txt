"1" "Rock The Hell Out Of You
Stryper

We're the thundering sons
We're the undying ones
With the power of good
Evil has never won

With armies from Heaven
We have fought with a rage
It's all in the rhythm
And the fire coming from the stage

CHORUS:
We will rock the hell out of you
We will rock the hell out of you

In the streets every day
We search for anyone
Who will fight anyway
Until the battle's won

We trust in our sabres
With the words that we sing
It's all in the rhythm
And the power coming from the stage

CHORUS

With armies from Heaven
We have fought with a rage
It's all in the rhythm
And the fire coming from the stage

CHORUS
"
