"1" "Your Love Has Conquered Me
Comunidade Cat√≥lica Shalom

There's none like You
Oh, God, my friend, my love
Who in this world
Would ever come tear us apart?

Neither death, nor pain
Or loneliness
Nothing is greater than
The kindness of Your Heart, my Lord

God, Your love has conquered me
Changing my life from within
How cannot I adore
Not give myself
Not surrender to Your love?
You've enkindled my heart
And Your forgiveness raised me up
All the praise be to the One
Who has done
All in me

I want to love You more
More than myself
In those whom You love
I want to love You more
More than myself
In those whom You love

God of love has conquered me
Changing my life from within
How cannot I adore
Not give myself
Not surrender to Your love
You've enkindled my heart
And Your forgiveness raised me up
All the praise be to the One
Who has done
All in me

I can no longer hold back
All this love inside of me"
