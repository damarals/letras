"1" "Is He Worthy?
Chris Tomlin

Do you feel the world is broken? We do
Do you feel the shadows deepen? We do
But do you know that all, the dark won't stopthe light from getting through? We do
Do you wish that you could see it, all made new? We do

Is all creation groaning? It is
Is a new creation coming? It is
Is the glory of the Lord to be
The light within our midst? It is
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this? It is

Is anyone worthy? is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break, the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah, who conquered the grave
He is David's root and the Lamb
Who died to ransom the slave

Is He worthy? is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy of this? He is

Does the Father truly love us? He does
Does the Spirit move among us? He does
And does Jesus our Messiah
Hold forever those He loves? He does
Does our God intend to dwell again with us? He does

From ev'ry people and tribe, ev'ry nation and tongue
He has made us a kingdom and priests to God
To reign with the Son

Is He worthy? is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy? is He worthy?
Is He worthy of this? He is, He is

Is He worthy, is He worthy of this? He is
He is, He worthy, is He worthy, He is"
