"1" "Let Your Glory Fall
Kari Jobe

A longing stirs in my soul
Draws me near
Calls me close
Deeper into this love
That won't run out
Won't dry out
Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain

Only now will I come before Your Throne
Holy one, by Your fevernous grace
Spirit flood, come flood this place
Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain

Let Your glory fall
Overwhelm my soul
Let Your presence flood my life, oh Lord
Deep is calling to deep
Revival's tied, breaking free
Jesus, reign in this place
Thirsty we cry, heaven in vain

Let Your glory fall
Overwhelm my soul
Let Your presence flood my life, oh Lord
Break upon me now
Let Your love crash down
Let Your glory fall
Let Your glory fall

Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain

Let Your glory fall
Overwhelm my soul
Let Your presence flood my life, oh Lord
Break upon me now
Let Your love crash down
Let Your glory fall
Let Your glory fall"
