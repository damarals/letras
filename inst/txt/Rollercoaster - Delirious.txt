Delirious

What is going on?
Living on this rollercoaster.
Up and down,
Twisting, turning, brusing, burning.

Speak to me,
Tell me all the things I want to hear.
Show me all the things I love so dear.
So speak.

Here I'm spinning on,
Living on this merry-go-round.
Off the ground,
Crying, flying, nauseating.

And I would take it all again,
If it means I get you.
I would sing this song again,
I'll let you."
