"1" "Lord My Strength
Hillsong United

I called to You in my distress
I came to You in my brokenness
And so You heard my heart confess
My need of You

CHORUS:
How I love You Lord my strength
You delivered me
You are all that I want
You are the air that I breathe

As You came like a hurricane
You split the sky just to rescue me
You reached from high
To help me to stand tall


BRIDGE:
With my God
I can run through the defences
On my knees I can face any foe
With my God
I can conquer any mountain
Cross the deepest valley
Break down any wall"
