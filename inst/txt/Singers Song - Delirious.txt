Delirious

Come on all us singers sing that Jesus Christ is Lord
Come on all us singers sing that Jesus Christ is Lord
Come on all us singers sing that Jesus Christ is Lord
Come on all us singers sing that Jesus Christ is Lord

As your people Lord we now stand before your throne,
A sacrifice of praise will be our song.
As your singers Lord we will shout that \"He is good
For His love endures forever\"

Come on all us singers sing that Jesus Christ is Lord
Come on all us singers sing that Jesus Christ is Lord
Come on all us singers sing that Jesus Christ is Lord
Come on all us singers sing that Jesus Christ is Lord
As your people Lord we will sing with thankfulness,
We want our lives to be a song of praise.
Banners we will wave to proclaim that \"He is good
For his love endures forever\"

Come on all us dancers dance that Jesus Christ is Lord
Come on all us dancers dance that Jesus Christ is Lord
Come on all us dancers dance that Jesus Christ is Lord
Come on all us dancers dance that Jesus Christ is Lord

Help us Lord to realize that our lips
were made for praising You
Not for bringing others down,
but for boasting of Your love.
Show us Lord that when we meet we have
our feet on holy ground,
Come and purify our lives,
forgive us for the wrong we've done.
We desire to see Your face,
but teach us first to \"Fear the Lord\"
Let us not presume your grace,
for the sin we bring is our disgrace
In Your mercy send Your power,
demons go in Jesus name
Heal the sick and save the lost,
reveal the power of the cross
Open up the heavens Lord
Open up the heavens Lord
Open up the heavens Lord
Open up the heavens Lord
Open up the heavens Lord
Let us sing the song that Jesus saves us!"
