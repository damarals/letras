"1" "What A Friend We Have In Jesus
Youthful Praise

What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bare!
What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer!
And I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Til' my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to thee,
How great thou art, how great thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee,
How great thou art, how great thou art!"
