"1" "Light Of The World
Lauren Daigle

The world waits for a miracle
The heart longs for a little bit of hope
Oh come, oh come emmanuel

The child prays for peace on earth
And she's calling out from a sea of hurt
Oh come, oh come emmanuel

And can you hear
The angels singing

Glory to the light of the world
Glory the light of the world is here

The drought breaks
With the tears of a mother
A babies cry is the sound
Of love come down
Come down, emmanuel

He is the song for the suffering
He is messiah
The prince of peace has come
He has come, emmanuel

Glory to the light of the world
Glory to the light of the world
Glory to the light of the world
For all who wait
For all who hunger
For all who've prayed
For all who wonder
Behold your king
Behold messiah
Emmanuel, emmanuel

Glory to the light of the world
Glory to the light of the world
Glory to the light of the world
Behold your king
Behold messiah
Emmanuel, emmanuel

The world waits for the miracle
The heart waits for a little bit of hope
O come, o come emmanuel"
