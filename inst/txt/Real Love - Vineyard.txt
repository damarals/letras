Vineyard

I've searched near and far for love that's true
Jesus nothing else compares with You
Only You can wash my sins away
Nothing else could ever take Your place

Real love
You are real love
Real love
You are real love

On the cross You showed me
Just how much You love me
You gave Your life to save me"
