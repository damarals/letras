"1" "He Will Never End
Michael W. Smith

There are whispers of an answer
In every corner of the earth
Echoes of a greater story
Of a love to break the curse
You may think it's over
But this is not the end

The world is waking up to the sound of his voice!
He left the grave behind and death is destroyed
He walks the earth again; the dead are rising still
He is the life, the breath, and he will never end!
He will never end

It's been told throughout the ages
The creator came to us
Took the shape of all our weakness
Breathed his final breath for love
It was never over
Because he rose again!

It can't be stopped, it cannot be reversed
None can erase the power of your word
It can't be stopped, it cannot be reversed
None can erase the power of your word
You are alive!
You are alive!

The world is waking up to the sound of your voice!
You left the grave behind, death is destroyed
You walk the earth again; the dead are rising still
You are the life, the breath, and you will never end!
You will never end
You will never end
You will never end"
