"1" "Still Mighty, Still Strong
Youthful Praise

The enemy tried to make me doubt
God would ever bring me out
Just like the hebrews boy
Told him I know
If he doesn't do it, I know he's able

He's still mighty, he's still strong
Still got the power, still on the throne
Still workin miracle for his own
He's still mighty, he's still strong

The lord is still great!
He has never changed
No matter what comes my way
The lord is worthy of praise

He's still mighty, he's still strong
Still got the power, still on the throne
Still workin miracle for his own
He's still mighty, he's still strong

He's still mighty, he's still strong...
He's still mighty...
He's still strong!"
