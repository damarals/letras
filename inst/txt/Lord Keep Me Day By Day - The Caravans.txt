"1" "Lord, Keep Me Day By Day
The Caravans

Verse 1:
Lord, keep my day by day,
in a pure and perfect way.
I want to live, I want to live on
in a building not made by hand.

Verse 2:
Lord, keep my body strong
so that I can do no wrong.
Lord, give me grace just to run this Christian race
to a building not made by hand.

Verse 3:
I'm just a stranger here,
traveling through this barren land.
Lord, I know there's a building somewhere,
a building not made by hand."
