"1" "The One I Love
Third Day

Oh, you of little faith
Why do you let the wind and the waves distract you
Oh, you of little faith
Don't you know that when you've
Fallen I'll be there to catch you

And when all your world is gone
And you cannot sing your song
I will help you carry on
The one I love

Oh, you of little faith
Oh, how quickly and how
Often you have forgotten
Oh, you of little faith
Aren't you tired of all the wars
And battles you have fought in

And when all your world is gone
And you cannot sing your song
I will help you carry on
The one I love
Oh, you of little faith
Why do you let the wind
And the waves distract you"
