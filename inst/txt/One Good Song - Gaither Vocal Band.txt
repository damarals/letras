"1" "One Good Song
Gaither Vocal Band

Well, I used to believe that the more you had
Got you through these days, made your poor heart glad.
But I'm paring down, I've been cutting back
And I don't even miss all the things I lack.

I'm learning how to separate the wants from the needs
The good life now consists of just a few simple things:

Jesus in my heart and a place to belong
A few close friends and one good song.
Oh, my latest list, well, it ain't too long
Just a Godly love and one good song.

Got a lighter load since I ridded out
Since I realized what it's all about.
It's a downsize day, and you can't take it all
They say little is much when you hear that call.

The focus cleared when excess made my heart prioritize
Now less is more when less includes the basics of life:

Jesus in my heart and a place to belong
A few close friends and one good song.
Oh, my latest list, well, it ain't too long
Just a Godly love and one good song.

Everyone's got cornerstones
And thank God I've got mine.
Here it is in black and white
Here's the bottom line:

Jesus in my heart and a place to belong
A few close friends and one good song.
Oh, my latest list, well, it ain't too long
Just a Godly love and one good song.

Just a Godly love and one good song."
