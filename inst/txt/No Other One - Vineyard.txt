Chorus:
There is no other One but You
There is no other One but You
There is not another one I love like You
Jesus

You give me peace
You give me strength to walk the miles
You give me hope
That there is more than just this life

You're in my heart
Like a river running wild
You're in my dreams
You mean everything to me
And I want to sing

Keep me safe from all the evil in this world
Grant me bread every day I walk this earth
You are holy You are worthy of my praise
I will worship You
You mean everything to me and I want to sing"
