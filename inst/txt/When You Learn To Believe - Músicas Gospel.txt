"1" "When You Learn To Believe
MÃºsicas Gospel

In this world it must be believed
That God's love can be received.
And if your dreams come true,
It's because he's loving you.

Most children learn to cope.
Believe in dreams and hope.
They see wishes coming true.
More so than me and you.

In this world there are those that do,
With others that are passing through.
But when you learn to believe,
Your dreams start coming true.

It's when we make amends,
That our real life begins.
When you learn to believe,
You won't lie and deceive.

In this world there are those that do,
With others that are passing through.
But when you learn to believe,
Your dreams start coming true."
