"1" "Here For You
MercyMe

(Verse)
Oh we're here to praise you
We're here to dance for you
With our hearts in view
We worship you
We're here to praise you
Oh we're here to praise you
We're here to celebrate
And proclaim your name
We worship you
We're here to praise you
Everything we have we bring
With all our strength oh God we shout to our king
(Chorus)
With our heart and soul we come before Jesus to worship you
(repeat)
