French Prayer:
Seigneur ce soir je veux te lever plus haut

(Lord, tonight I want to lift you up higher)
Saint-Esprit, viens, danse avec nous
(Holy Spirit, come, dance with us)
Jesus, mon Jesus, je t'aime
(Jesus, my Jesus, I love you)

Father I long to know You
Take me in Your loving arms
My being longs to show You
The feelings of my heart

I love You Lord
And what You've done for me
I will worship You
I will bow the knee"
