Kutless

Oh Lord, You’re beautiful
Your face is all I see
And when Your eyes, are on this child
Your grace abounds to me

There is a redeemer, Jesus God’s own Son
Precious Lamb of God Messiah
Holy One

Thank You oh my Father
For giving us Your Son
And leaving Your Spirit till
The work on earth is done

Thank You oh my Father
For giving us Your Son
And leaving Your Spirit till
The work on earth is done

Hallelujah...
