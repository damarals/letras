"1" "Blood from above
Stryper

A star to shine, a true life divine
Born to die for me and for you
Prophesied, with no love denied
It's Redemption and power so true

(Chorus)
He's a holy human sacrifice
Nailed upon a cross
A righteous murder scene of love
Flowing down grace
In The Blood From Above

Evils is damned in the special plan
A straight & narrow path is for all
The crucifixion the torment of I am
Where Golgothas at
He answered The Call

(Chorus)
He's a holy human sacrifice
Nailed upon a cross
A righteous murder scene of love
Flowing down grace
In The Blood From Above"
