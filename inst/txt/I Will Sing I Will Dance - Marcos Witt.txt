"1" "I Will Sing, I Will Dance
Marcos Witt

You and You alone have given me life
if i climbed the highest mountain
or searched througth the valley below
where could i find who could show mw
that kind of love?

I will sing, i will dance
i will pour out my heart before you Lord
in the river of your love.

How did i live without you Lord,
my heart and soul were lost i the darkness
You reached down from Heaven and touch me
your love has captured my heart
where could i find who could show mw
that kind of love?

I will sing, i will dance
i will pour out my heart before you Lord
in the river of your love.

Wasted years away from you
looking for love that i could not see
until i found the love
the love of God here in the river."
