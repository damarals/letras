Jeremy Camp

I spin around i can hardly see
To catch a glimpse of this moment

I hear th sound of this simple plea
To wait at the feet of your love

Everytime I'm on my knees pleading for
Your strength
I'll find you there
I'll find you there

Everytime I'm on my knees reaching for
Your strength
I'll find you there
I'll find you there

To fell the crown of the one I have
Breathed for
To know the door it will
Never be broken

Cos I've found that time
This time has no
Hold on the rate that I need you and I know
It's never hard to find you

I'm holding on to this hope
I've been given
To be always with you
I'm seeing now that
This fullness of faith is always seeking you"
