"1" "Thirty Pieces Of Silver
MÃºsicas Gospel

Tis a sad but true story, from the bible it came,
And it tells us how Judas sold the Savior in shame,
He planned with the council of high priests that day,
Thirty pieces of silver was the price they would pay.

Thirty pieces of silver, thirty shekels of shame,
Was the price paid for Jesus on the cross he was slain,
Betrayed and forsaken, unloved and unclaimed,
In anger they pierced Him, but He died not in vain.

'Twas there on the hillside, the multitude came
And found our dear Savior then took him away;
They smote and they mocked him, thorns were crowned 'round his head,
And His raiment of purple showed the bloodstains of red.

Far off in the mountain with his face toward the sun,
Judas begged mercy for what he had done;
He gave back the silver for his heart filled with strife,
Then there in the mountains he took his own life.

Thirty pieces of silver, thirty shekels of shame,
Was the price paid for Jesus on the cross he was slain,
Betrayed and forsaken, unloved and unclaimed
In anger they pierced Him, but He died not in vain"
