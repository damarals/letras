P.O.D.

In the game when the bones are stacked
Drawin' a blank with a mental collapse
Just wait, things don't always go my way
Who take the blame when no one reacts
That might explain why we're headed off track
Look straight, things are gonna go my way

Push me down once and it's not okay
Fall and drop it down, well it's my choice to make
If I stood my ground then maybe you all might
Hang with me awhile and watch the whole world fall like

Domino, domino
Falling like a domino
Domino, domino
Drop it down like a domino
Domino, domino
Falling like a domino
Domino, domino
Drop it down like a domino

It's, never too late, free the weight off your back
Retaliate when you're under attack
Take claim, when things don't seem to go your way
Anticipate, don't ever fall for the trap
Stand alone and you'll see who's got your back
Well played, things are gonna fall your way

Push me down once and it's not okay
Fall and drop it down, well it's my choice to make
If I stood my ground then maybe you all might
Hang with me awhile and watch the whole world fall like

Domino, domino
Falling like a domino
Domino, domino
Drop it down like a domino
Domino, domino
Falling like a domino
Domino, domino
Drop it down like a domino

Domino, domino
Falling like a domino
Domino, domino
Drop it down like a domino
Domino, domino
Falling like a domino
Domino, domino
Drop it down like a domino"
