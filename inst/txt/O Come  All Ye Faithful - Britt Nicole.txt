"1" "O Come , All Ye Faithful
Britt Nicole

O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of angels

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Let us come
Let us come
Let us come
Let us come

Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing all ye citizens
Of Heaven above
Glory to God
Glory in the highest

Come and adore Him
Come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Let us come
Let us come
Let us come and adore Him

Come and adore Him
Come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord"
