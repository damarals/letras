Skillet

One man, one mission
One plot to save the world
Reclaim all races
And embrace our destiny

Changing history when the colliding comes
Where will you run
Come with us if you want to live

Join us in the army that's arising
The truth invades your mind
Every day the Kingdom is advancing
The earth invasion has just begun

Without a sound, without fear
It attacks the heart and soul
To rule all life and display His government

Join us in the army that's arising
The truth invades your mind
Every day the Kingdom is advancing
The earth invasion has just begun
Join us in the army that's arising
The truth invades your mind
Every day the Kingdom is advancing
The earth invasion has just begun

The earth's frustration
To be whole again
We'll see a nation
Living without sin

The earth invasion
One man, one mission
One plot to save the world

Join us in the army that's arising
The truth invades your mind
Every day the Kingdom is advancing
The earth invasion has just begun"
