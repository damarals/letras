"1" "Jesus, The Same
Hillsong United

There's a light in the darkness that shines
Giving hope to all the world, hope to all the world.
There's a door that's been opened to all
Into a new and living way, a new and living way.

Praise the name of Jesus
Perfect redeemer, star of the morning
Yesterday, today and forever
Jesus, the same.

There's a fire that burns in our hearts
To see the lost return to the Father.
It's a passion that's not of our own
We have seen it in the Son, in the face of the Son.

Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace."
