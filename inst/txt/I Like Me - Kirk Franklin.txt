Kirk Franklin

(feat. Da' T.R.U.T.H.)

[Chorus:]
I like me,
Yo, you like?
Cause I like me
Do you like me?
See I like me
Cause he likes me
God likes me
You, you don't like me? [x2]

[Verse 1: Kirk Franklin]
Short, big nose, big lips
Kinda st- st- stutter but - I never trip
Got my daddy's swagger and I walk with a limp
Got a hot wife - no need to be a pimp
Never been cute - Never been fly since I been changed got that twinkle in mye
Got my grill fixed, now I smile when I speak
Tell me who that is, that's the Jesuse Freak, it's ya boy

[Chorus:]
I like me,
Yo, you like?
Cause I like me
Do you like me?
See I like me
Cause he likes me
God likes me
You, you don't like me? [x2]

[Verse 2: Da' T.R.U.T.H.]
I just smile - I'm so content
And I ain't even got yellow stones on my wrist
I hear the world I'm supposed to be rich
Bud I don't but that - Man, I don't go with the trends
Go the whole mile - lose or win
I hope that's the impression that the CDs give
I'm more concerned about how they see me live
Than trying to get a house on MTV cribs

[Chorus:]
I like me,
Yo, you like?
Cause I like me
Do you like me?
See I like me
Cause he likes me
God likes me
You, you don't like me? [x2]

[Verse 3: Kirk Franklin and Da' T.R.U.T.H.]
When the light fade - I know that you see
More than my swagger - But it's you in me
From the storefront church to the packed out floors
They want an autograph but I'd rather give 'em yours
Ya ink don't fade - the crowd wants more
The King's on stage - the final encore
Can't beleve it's - me now I'm chillin' backstage
Big nose, big lips, gon' get ya hands raised

[Chorus:]
I like me,
Yo, you like?
Cause I like me
Do you like me?
See I like me
Cause he likes me
God likes me"
