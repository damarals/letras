verse

Whatever life may bring, it's all right
I'm a child of the King, it's all right
That's the reason I sing, it's all right
chorus
I will never be the same
Cause I'm covered by your name
Your glorious name Jesus
Your grace has set me free
And given me a peace
Beyond understanding Jesus
verse
There'll be hard times I know, It's all right
Let Your glory be shown, it's all right
You remain on your throne, it's all right
verse


Even though I'm unworthy, it's all right
By Your blood I am holy, it's all right
