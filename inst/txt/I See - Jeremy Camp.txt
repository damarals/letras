Jeremy Camp

I take a look at my life and I wonder why
I go through the things I do
Then I see everything in a different light
and understand Your promise isn't through

To make me a man wholly devoted to You
And keep a childlike faith

I see that it's best for me to
go though that struggles that I have
To help me to clearly see, and to shape
me and mold me as I am

The purpose sometimes we may not know
and the hope may not be clearly seen
There are many things He wants to show and
He wants everything at his feet

To make me a man wholly devoted to You
and keep a childlike faith

I see that it's best for me to go
through the struggles that I have
To help me to clearly see
and to shape me and mold me as I am

You always bring me back into Your arms
and You never let you never let me go
You guide my every step and with me
With me I know You are

I see, that it's best for me I see, I see"
