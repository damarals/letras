Hillsong United

Our God He lives forever
He reigns in power and love
Let Earth bow down before Him
For He is exalted

We look to Yahweh, Yahweh
Forever Yahweh, Yahweh

Our hope is God Almighty
His love is greater than all
Lift high the God of heaven
Give all the honour

We look to Yahweh, Yahweh
Our hope is Yahweh, Yahweh

(CHORUS)
He shall reign forever
He shall reign forever
He shall reign forever
And ever our God"
