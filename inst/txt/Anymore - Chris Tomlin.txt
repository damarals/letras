Chris Tomlin

I should have known this
They say that I'm from Mars and you're from Venus
But I tried it anyway
Who am I to think that I could understand your brain...That's insane
I guess I love you, that's the only explanation for what I do
When you are around
Girl I get so crazy when I look into your eyes
It makes me think that

CHORUS:
I am gonna take you right down to the station
Where I'm gonna buy you a one-way ticket out of here
And I'll send you a postcard from the farthest place from there
And I'll sign it I'm so glad that you ain't here
And I'll build you a big ole ugly statue of my new girlfriend-
The one I left you for
Then I'll send it C.O.D. express mail to your door
That's exactly what I'll do as soon as I don't love you
anymore That's for sure

I got this theory the women of the world are out to get me
And I know of one who tried
She seemed to think that I could be her friend for life girl think twice
Cause friends don't kiss me
And they pay for their own ticket at the movie
So I hope you brought some cash
And you and all your other friends can do what you want to but girl I think we're thru

CHORUS 2:
I guess I'll drive you way out in the country
Where I'll leave you with nothing but your clothes
And I'll watch you get smaller in the mirror as I drive
And I pray to God that you'll survive so you can
See me on every single station of your TV singin about you
And makin' money Just think of all the things I could afford
And I won't spend a nickel on you cause I don't think I'll love you anymore

BRIDGE:
(vocal 1) Oh you may think that I sound angry
(vocal 2) But girls have driven him so crazy
(1)-I won't be held accountable
(2)-He can't be held responsible
For what I'm about to do to you

I think I'll see you...

CHORUS"
