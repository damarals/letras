"1" "Just To Be With You
Third Day

I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain
Just to be with the one he loves.
How many times has he broken that promise?
It has never been done
Well I never climbed the highest mountain,
but I walked the hill of calvary

And just to be with you I'll do anything,
there's no price I would not pay, no
and just to be with you I'll give everything.
And I would give my life away.
Yeaaaa

I've heard it said that a man would swim the oceans
Just to be with the one he loves.
But All of those dreams are an empty emotion
It can never be done.
Well I've never swim the deepest oceans
But I walked upon the raging sea

And just to be with you I'll do anything,
there's no price I would not pay, no
and just to be with you I'll give everything.
And I would give my life away.
Yeaaaa

And I know that you don't understand the fullness of my love
How I died upon the Cross for your sin
And I know that you don't realize how much that I gave you
And I promise I would do it all again

And just to be with you I've done everything
There's no price I did not pay, no
And just to be with you I gave everything
Yes I gave my life away.
Yeaaaaa
I gave my life away
Yeaaaaa
Just to be with you
Aww just to be with you (3x)"
