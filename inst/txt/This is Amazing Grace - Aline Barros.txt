"1" "This is Amazing Grace
Aline Barros

Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?
The King of glory, the King above all kings

Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
The King of glory, the King above all kings

This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross
You laid down your life, that I would be set free
Oh, Jesus I sing for all that You've done for me

Who brings our chaos back into order?
Who makes the orphans a son and daughter?
The King of glory, the King of glory
Who runs the nations with truth and justice?
Shine like the sun in all of its brilliance
The King of glory, the King above all kings

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the King that conquered the grave
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the Ling that conquered the grave
Worthy, worthy, worthy"
