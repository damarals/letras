"1" "O Come All Ye Faithful
Lauren Daigle

Oh come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
Oh come ye oh come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him born the King of angels

Oh come let us adore Him, oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord

Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing all ye citizens of heav'n above
Glory to God, glory in the highest

Oh come let us adore Him, oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him Christ the Lord

Yea Lord we greet Thee
Born this happy mornning
Jesus to thee be all glory giv'n
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing

Oh come let us adore Him, oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Oh come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord"
