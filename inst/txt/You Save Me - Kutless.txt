"x"
"1" "You Save Me
Kutless

Time and time again
I’ve gone running
Chasing after empty plans

That steal my heart away
And leave me broken
My only hope is in Your hands

You save me
You set me free
Forever Savior You will rescue me

Forgiven
Now I will sing
Forever Savior You will rescue me

I’ll never be the same
Your love is changing
Everything

You pulled me from the grave
Wrapped me in Your arms
Jesus You have won my heart

You save me
You set me free
Forever Savior You will rescue me

Forgiven
Now I will sing
Forever Savior You will rescue me

Jesus Messiah
You rescued me
You rescued me

Mighty Redeemer

You save me, You save me

You save me
You set me free
Forever Savior You will rescue me

Forgiven
Now I will sing
Forever Savior You will rescue me
