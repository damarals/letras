"1" "Shine All Your Light
Amy Grant

Here under heaven's eyes
Down under paradise
Sometimes it seems like we're so small
Here on the shores that reach
Into infinity
How could we matter much at all?
Would it be enough
If each of us would give our love?

Like sand on a mountain
Rain on a fountain
Shade on a shadow
A breeze in this tornado
Just do what you can
Clap with one hand
And shine all Your light in the sun

We live to learn to love
O, mercy from above
Amazing grace like rain
Comes falling down
We sing our hearts to You
Our song of graditude
the voice of every soul
How sweet the sound
We can only trust
That all our prayers will all add up

Like sand on a mountain
Rain on a fountain
Shade on a shadow
A breeze in this tornado
Just do what you can
Clap with one hand
And shine all Your light in the sun

Would it be enough (would it be enough)
If each of us would give our love?"
