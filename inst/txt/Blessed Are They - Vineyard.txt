Blessed are they that know the joyful sound.
Blessed are they that know the joyful sound.
They shall walk in the light the light of His countenance,
They shall walk in the light of the Lord.
And in Your name shall we rejoice all day.
In Your name shall we rejoice all day.
We shall be exalted by Your righteousness,
For You are the glory of our strength.
You have anointed us with the sacred oil,

And the songs of Zion burn within. (Oh Yeah)
Oh Lord release to us the supernatural sounds,
The sounds of deliverance,
So when men hear they'll fear Your name
And obey the call to follow, follow.
Blessed are they that know the joyful sound
Blessed are they that know the joyful sound.
They shall walk in the light the light of His countenance,
They shall walk in the light of the Lord.
hold the Lamb of God so spotless and pure is He!
Behold Him crucified
Deserving and worthy is He To be
Honored and adored As Prince of life
The highest Lord!
Behold the Lamb of God, Behold the Lamb of God.

Behold the Lamb of God Upon the throne He reigns!
Behold the angels sing praises to His name
He is honored and adored
As God of hope and gracious Lord!
Behold the Lamb of God, Behold the Lamb of God."
