"1" "Make Me Whole
Vineyard

You're the keeper of my soul
Through every drought and storm
When life leaves me worn and cold
You shelter me and peace ows

Breath of God spring new life
Spirit move through my bones
Holy love embrace me
Stir my heart, wake my soul
Bring new life and make me whole

You're the light in my dark
Through seasons all alone
When my strength wanes and fails me
You carry me when I can't walk"
