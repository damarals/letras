"1" "King Or Cripple
Delirious

King or cripple,
What have I become?
Beneath these kingly robes,
There lies a fragile man
What made me a king can sometimes cripple
All that you give can sometimes rob my innocence

Why do you let us walk upon a cliff so steep,
When deep below the sea there lies a bed of gold?
And if this should be our battle place,
Don't let me fall
Don't let us fall

Keep me
Won't you keep me?
Keep me
Won't you keep me?

I'd love to hold the hand of one who healed the blind
And saw the leper run into the arms of love
And king or cripple, they were the same to you
You took a broken man and you treat him like a king

Keep me
Won't you keep me?
Keep me
Won't you keep me?

King or,
King or,
King or cripple?
You took a broken man and you treat him like a king
