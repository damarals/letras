"1" "Use My Life (Sonda-Me, Usa-Me)
Aline Barros

Search in all my heart
Oh Lord almighty
Let it be broken
For You
According to Your word
Transform and change me
And with the Spirit fill my life
Until it overflows

Then Lord
Use my life for You
Use my life

Just like a lighthouse in the darkness
Like a bridge over the waters
Like a shelter in the desert
Like an arrow that has picked a target
Lord I want to please You every time
That I am serving You and
Where you want to send me God
Here I am, oh Lord send me
And use my life, for You
Use my life

Oh search in all my heart
Oh Lord almighty
Let it be broken
For You
According to Your word
Transform and change me
And with the Spirit fill my life
Until it overflows

Then Lord
Use my life for You
Use my life

Just like a lighthouse in the darkness
Like a bridge over the waters
Like a shelter in the desert
Like an arrow that has picked a target
Lord I want to please You every time
That I am serving You and
Where you want to send me God
Here I am, oh Lord send me
And use my life, for You
Use my life

Search my heart
Break my heart
Transform my life
Fill my life
Search my heart
Break my heart
Transform my life
Fill my life
And use it all for You

Just like a lighthouse in the darkness
Like a bridge over the waters
Like a shelter in the desert
Like an arrow that has picked a target
Lord I want to please You every time
That I am serving You and
Where you want to send me God
Here I am, oh Lord send me
And use my life, for You
Use my life

Search my heart
Break my heart
Transform my life
Fill my life
Search my heart
Break my heart
Transform my life
Fill my life
And use it all for You

Yeah, use my life for You"
