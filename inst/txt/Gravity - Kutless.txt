You've dealt me every card I have played,
But I know I'm guilty of choices I've made

This is not the mystery that's constantly consuming me
It's how a god so holy could love someone like me

No matter where I go your mercy follows
And I come running back to you

Your gravity keeps pulling me to you
I must have been destined for you

You knew this human heart would be lost
So you planned a ransom and you paid the cost

There's more beyond my mind that I can't see but I believe,
Because you are the only god who died for me

No matter where I go your mercy follows
And I come running back to you"
