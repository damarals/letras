"1" "These Are They
Gaither Vocal Band

The oceans give up
All the dead that are in them
The graves open wide
To set captives free
And those who are roaming
The earth rise to meet them
Abrahams seed as the sands of the sea

Chorus
These are they
Who have come out
Of great tribulation
They have washed their robes
In the blood of the lamb
They have gone through much sorrow
Into great jubilation
They're redeemed by the blood of the Lamb

Like a strong mighty army
Their voices are ringing
The great crowds of witnesses
Sing freedom song
As they enter the country
Built by their own father
The promised homeland
They yearned for so long

All the strangers and pilgrims
Are no longer strangers
All the tired, weary wanderer's
They will wander no more
The table is ready
For the great celebration
And the welcome home banner
Flies over the door"
