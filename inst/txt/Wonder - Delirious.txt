Delirious

Is it any wonder that my heart is on the line
Is it any wonder that my words are out of time
Is it any wonder that I miss you like your mine

Oh sweet heart you’ve broken this sweet heart
Oh sweet heart you’ve broken me.

You set my world on fire
I’m turning inside out to be with you
So I’ll be waiting here
And our love can live forever
Cuz In your eyes I’ve seen who I could be
So I’ll be waiting here

Is it any wonder that you stole this heart of mine
Is it any wonder that our worlds are now entwined
Often I have wondered if I need a redesign"
