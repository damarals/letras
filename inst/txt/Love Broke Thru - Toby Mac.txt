"1" "Love Broke Thru
Toby Mac

I was feelin' that, feelin' that breeze
Singin' like a song thru the tall oak trees
It was just another summer night
Had to be the last thing on my mind
Yeah, I was all but lost in the moment
I was young and runnin' wide open
It was just another summer night
Had to be the last thing on my mind

When love broke thru
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' thru the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke thru
And it all began with You
When love broke thru

I did all that I could to undo me
But You loved me enough to pursue me
Yeah, You drew me out of the shadows
Made me believe that I mattered, to You, You
You were there, You heard my prayer in that broke down dusty room
It was the first time I said, \"I'm Your's\"
The first time I called You Lord

Yeah, it was late in the summer when the northeast breeze
Sang like a song thru the oak trees
Pennsylvania, she kind of caught my soul
Which had me a little more open than closed
Walls I built, opinions I learned
Covered in the ashes of bridges I burned
Blind to the arrow that headed to my heart
But You hit the mark

When love broke thru
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' thru the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You

When love broke thru
And it all began with You
When love broke thru

I did all that I could to undo me
But You loved me enough to pursue me"
