"1" "On The Mountain
Selah

I've been climbing my whole life
And I'm only at the bottom of the mountain
At the bottom of the mountain
Rising up from my feet in the daylight
Rising up into the clouds and out of my sight
Is the height of that mountain

Oh my hands cannot reach it
And my mind can?t comprehend it
But my soul is gonna get there one day
No, my hands cannot reach it
And my mind can?t comprehend it
But my soul is gonna het there one day

Lord, there shoes are gonna need some help
So we can make it to the top of the mountain
To the top of your mountain
Many feet have gone before us
With a habit of faith and courage
They're meet us at the road?s end
Well, my hands cannot reach it
And my mind can?t comprehend it

But my soul is gonna get there one day
One day
Tough my hands cannot reach it
And my mind can?t comprehend it
But my soul is gonna get there one day
Yes, yes
I think I will
Oh, yes
I know we will
Yes, yes
I know we will

Oh, yeah, I know we?
I've been climbing my whole life
And I'm only at the bottom of the mountain
At the bottom of the mountain
All along this road
When it feels so far to the top

You say: \"just hold onto the mountain\"
Climbing up to the top of the mountain
Tough my hands cannot reach it
And my mind can?t comprehend it
But my soul is gonna get there one day
One day

Tough my hands cannot reach it
And my mind can?t comprehend it
But my soul is gonna get there one day
Tough my hands cannot reach it
And my mind can?t comprehend it

But my soul is gonna get there one day
Tough my hands cannot reach it
And my mind can?t comprehend it
But my soul is gonna get there one day
Get there one day

Well my soul
My soul
Is gonna get there
One day"
