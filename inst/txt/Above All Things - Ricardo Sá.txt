"1" "Above All Things
Ricardo Sá

Open your heart, let the spirit in
He is here now! He is here now!


So let us praise the Lord!
I wanna worship Him above all things
So let us praise the Lord!
I wanna be with Him forever more.

Come Holy Spirit over me
Let me feel, the love the Lord has for me
I wanna be loved, I wanna be loved

So let us praise the Lord!
I wanna worship Him above all things
So let us praise the Lord!
I wanna be with Him forever more.

Even when, thereÂ’s nothing else for me
Send your spirit to me oh Lord
I need Him!!"
