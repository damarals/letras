"1" "We Want The Same Things (please Don’t Make Me Beg)
Switchfoot

I can hear it like a whisper, I can feel it on the street
Please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg
And I see it on the face of every stranger that I meets
Please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg

Hey

When I handed you my heart I thought, put that need to bed
Darlin please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg
For your time and your attention and the thoughts inside your head
Oh please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg

The meeting of our minds, the touching of our skin
We both have different ways, to let each other in

- Chorus –
We want the same things, to be loved
We need the same things, to have enough
We want the same things, someone to trust
We need the same things, please don’t make me beg

There’s a man down on the corner, guitar case at his feet
Oh please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg
And he’s singing out with gladness, and he’s doing it for for free
Oh please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg

Such a simple choice, to share the things we have
He’s got an angel voice, it’s money that he lacks

Said the son to the father, must I drink from this cup
Please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg
And let my death be the redemption, for every single one
Oh please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg

That man changed everything when he was lifted up
Can’t you hear him say just don’t run from love

Don’t make me beg"
