Third Day

Lyrics & Music by Mac Powell

From the recording: Third Day, Track #3.

Hey mama, take a look at me now
Things are going fine here in the big town
Hey mama, if you could only see
All of my friends and how they love me.

Chorus:
And I know you say I need Jesus
Mama can't you see I'm doing fine
And I know you say I need Jesus
But mama I ain't got the time. No, no.

Hey mama, it's been two long years
Since I have seen you - how I need you here
Hey mama, things they aren't the same
Since I last wrote you - Yea things have changed

Repeat Chorus


Well everything's going wrong
No, I can't take it no more (repeat)
I need Jesus, forgive me
Come into my life. Come into my heart.
Precious Jesus
