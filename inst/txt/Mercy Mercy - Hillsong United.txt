Mercy mercy
Bring me to my knees
As the morning
Calls to light the dark in me

Heaven's story
Breathing life into my bones
Spirit lift me
From this wasteland lead me home

Now I
Find my life in Yours
My eyes
On Your Name

Arrest my heart
From its reckless path
Release the chains in me
Awake my soul
To the hope You hold
Your grace is all I need

Humble glory
Chose to carry all my shame
Rendered worthy
In the shadow of Your Name

Gracious fury
Written in my Saviour's scars
Mercy mercy
Now engraved upon my heart"
