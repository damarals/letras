"1" "I Could Sing of Your Love
MercyMe

Over the mountain to the sea your river runs with love
for me and I will open up my heart and let the healer
set me free. I'm happy to be in the truth and on
the day you lift me hands for I will always sing of
when your love came down.
*Chorus*
I could sing of your love forever. (4x)

Over the mountains to the sea your river runs with
love for me and I will open up my heart and let the
healer set me free. I'm happy to be in the truth
and on the day you lift my hands for I will always
sing of when your love came down.

*Chorus* ( 16x)
Over the mountain to the sea your river runs with love
for me and I will open up my heart and let the healer
set me free. I'm happy to be in the truth and on
the day you lift me hands for I will always sing of
when your love came down."
