Chorus
Taste and see that the lord is good
Taste and see he's so good for you
Taste and see that the lord is good
Taste and see he's so good for you

For the light will bring to all
A harvest good and plenty
But for those who don't, don't believe it,
Their life will still, will still be empty

- chorus -

Don't let yourself, yourself be taken
By the foolish words of men
They say that god is oh-so tasteless,
But they've never tasted him

Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na

Rap:
Ah! i gotta express
My point of view
To the world.
So i'm tellin' you.
Newsboys
Are here in effect
With the word of god,
And so you'd better check us out.
We're christians.
You know what i mean.
Full-bustin' a rap
With the holy ghost scene.
Throwing down the truth,
As a matter of fact.
Step up, homie,
It's a sanctified rap.

Christians?!
You betcha.
And if you wanna know,
I'm gonna let ya
That the power of god
Has taken over my life.
And give your life to him
And it will get ya...

- chorus -"
