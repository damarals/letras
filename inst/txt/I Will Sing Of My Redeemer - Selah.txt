Will Sing of My Redeemer

(verse 1)
I will sing of my Redeemer
He who took the nails for me
I’ve been purchased, I’ve been pardoned
Bound to Him I’m truly free

(verse 2)
I will sing of my Redeemer
How He sought me while a slave
Loosed me from the curse of sin and
From the power of the grave

(chorus)
I will sing of my Redeemer
Lift my voice to praise my Lord
Ransomed by His blood and mercy
I am His forevermore

(verse 3)
I will sing of my Redeemer
He who bore my cross, my curse
Came a servant, chose to suffer
Lifted up and cast from earth

(verse 4)
I will sing of my Redeemer
Tell about the grace I’ve known
Here on earth with those forgiven
And one day around His throne
