"1" "Though I'm Not Worthy
Kari Jobe

though I’m not worthy
to see Your precious face
i bow before Thee
pour out Your holy grace
for You alone can wash my sin
cleanse my soul so deep within
heal me
wash me in your mercy
mend these broken pieces of my heart
clothe me
though I am not worthy
cleanse my soul and make me whole again
only say the word
and i shall be healed.
thought I am not worthy
in Your grace i long to stand
and bow before Thee
stretch out Your healing hand
For You alone can purify
and heal these wounds so deep inside.
Heal me
wash me in Your mercy
mend these broken pieces of my heart
clothe me
though I am not worthy
cleanse my soul and make me whole again
only say the word
and i shall be healed.
Be Healed.
I’m not worthy
to feel your love oh Lord
to bow before Thee
my Savior be adored
for You alone
break hardened hearts
and bid all bitterness depart
Heal me
wash me in Your mercy
mend these broken pieces of my heart
cloth me
thought I am not worthy
cleanse my soul and make me whole again.
Only say the word,
and I shall be healed."
