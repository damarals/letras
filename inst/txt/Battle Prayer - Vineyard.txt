Vineyard

Let your light come
Break down the darkness
Let your power roll back the night
May your truth shine setting captives free
Make your people strong for the fight

Open our eyes, burn in our hearts
Fill us with power again
Send forth your word, set us apart
The battle is won in your name
The battle is won in your name
For you are the Lord"
