"1" "Stay For Awhile
Amy Grant

Long time since I've seen you smile
But when I close my eyes I remember (I remember), mmm
You were no more than a child
But then so was I, young and tender.

Time carries on
I guess it always will
Deep inside my heart
Time stands still.

Stay for a while
Well, it's good to see your smile
And I love the company
Stay for a while
And remember the days gone by
For a moment it can seem
Just the way it used to be.

Snowfalls, phone calls, broken hearts
Clear summer days, warm and lazy, yea
Long walks, long talks after dark
We felt we'd never forget
Now it's easy.

Time takes its toll
And time alters our youth
It would be nice to spend some
Time with you.

Oh, stay for a while
Well, it's good to see your smile
And I love the company
(Oh) Stay for a while
And remember the days gone by
For a moment it can seem
Just the way it used to be."
