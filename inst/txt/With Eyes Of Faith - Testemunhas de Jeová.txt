"1" "With Eyes Of Faith
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

Why should I fear the lion?
Why should I fear any foe?
With Jehovah by my side
I will not run and hide
My God is with me, this I know

With eyes of faith, I see beyond the darkness
With eyes of faith, there's nothing more to fear
With Jehovah, I am strong
Determined to go on
Knowing that my God is always near
With eyes of faith

Those faithful ones before us
Lived their lives in loyalty
By their faith they endured
Their future is assured
They'll stand again for all to see

With eyes of faith, I see beyond the darkness
With eyes of faith, there's nothing more to fear
With Jehovah, I am strong
Determined to go on
Knowing that my God is always near
With eyes of faith

With eyes of faith, I can move a mountain
With eyes of faith, my hope is sure
Where would I be
Without the faith that helps me see
Beyond the trials I endure?

I see the wondrous future
God has in store for me
I need to be strong
I know it won't be long
Till Jehovah claims his victory

With eyes of faith, I see beyond the darkness
With eyes of faith, there's nothing more to fear
With Jehovah, I am strong
Determined to go on
Knowing that my God is always near
With eyes of faith
With eyes of faith"
