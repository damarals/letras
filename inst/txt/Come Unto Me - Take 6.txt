"1" "Come Unto Me
Take 6

Come unto me, all ye that labor
And i will give you rest
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me
For i am meek and lowly of heart
And ye shall find rest unto your souls
Rest unto your souls,
Rest unto your souls,
It's easy
For my burden is light
Repeat
It's easy
For my burden is light"
