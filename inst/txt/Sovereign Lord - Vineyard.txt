Vineyard

Oh Lord I lift Your name up
I worship You my King
For You are the Sovereign I Am
Deserving of all glory
All honor and all praise
For You are the Sovereign I Am

Sovereign Lord
Your ways are not my own
Your wisdom never ends
Sovereign Lord
You've created the heavens
Yet You call me Your friend

Your love reaches the heavens
Still You hold me when I'm weak
Your faithfulness is unending
For You reach the depths of me"
