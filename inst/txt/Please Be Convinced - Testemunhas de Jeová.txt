Testemunhas de Jeov√°

You have been praying
You have been preaching
You have been loyal through ev'rything
And though we don't see all the trials you face
Know that Jehovah's seeing it all

So when you stand in front of court officials
You are not alone
Your example speaks to all of us
And Jehovah knows

'For I am convinced
That death nor life nor governments
will separate us from God's love. '
'For I am convinced
That things to come nor powers
can separate us from God's love. '
So please be convinced
That you are in God's love
You have been faithful
You have not wavered
You looked to Jehovah
Through all the storms
And though enemies try and stop the good news
Know that you have much more backing you

So when you stand in front of court officials
You are not alone
Your example speaks to all of us
And Jehovah knows

'For I am convinced
That death nor life nor governments
will separate us from God's love. '
'For I am convinced
That things to come nor powers
can separate us from God's love. '
So please be convinced
That you are in God's love
Please know you are

It is written: 'You would suffer for the One you love'
Oh, the God you love
'But on the contrary, you are coming off victorious'
Oh, victorious

'So I am convinced
That death nor life nor governments
will separate us from God's love. '
'For I am convinced
That things to come nor powers
can separate us from God's love. '
'For I am convinced
That death nor life nor governments
will separate us from God's love. '
'For I am convinced
That things to come nor powers
can separate us from God's love. '
So please be convinced
That you are in God's love"
