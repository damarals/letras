I cover up the pain that I'm lost in
'Cause I wanna be enough and it's exhausting
Trying so hard but really I'm just wearing my heart out
And I find myself right on the verge of a breakdown

Then You hold me in Your hands
Remind me who You are and who I am

I was born broken so You can make me whole
I'll bring my dirt and let You wash over me like water (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I was born to need You, to wipe the tears I cry
Yes, You made me a child so You could be my Father
I'm Your child and You're my Father (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Even when I'm lost and I don't feel found
When humans are human and they let me down
You're still my Father

I was born broken so You can make me whole
I'll bring my dirt and let You wash over me like water (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I was born to need You, to wipe the tears I cry
Yes, You made me a child so You could be my Father
I'm Your child and You're my Father (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

You lead me, protect me, bring me home
I'm weak and afraid but You never let go
And I don't have to hide 'cause You already know
Already know
You're still my Father (Oh-ooh)

I was born broken so You can make me whole
I'll bring my dirt and let You wash over me like water (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I was born to need You, to wipe the tears I cry
Yes, You made me a child so You could be my Father (Father)
I'm Your child and You're my Father (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm Your child and"
