"1" "I've Found In You a Place
Diante do Trono

I've Found In You A Place
Where All My Fears Fall Away
It's Here I Want To Stay Forever
I've Found A Life In You
And All I Want To Do
Is Worship Only You Forever

I've Seen The Light That Shines
It Is Your Love Divine
Breaking The Chains That Bind My Soul
The Splendor In Your Eyes
Awakens Me Inside
From This Love I Cannot Hide

There Is No Better Place To Be
Than Hidden In Your Heart So Deep
I Know That I Am Safe In You, My Jesus

I Find Myself In Your Eyes
For I'm Yours, And You Are Mine
Your Holiness Amazes Me
When I`M Lost In Your Arms
For You Are Holy, Holy
Holy, Oh Lord"
