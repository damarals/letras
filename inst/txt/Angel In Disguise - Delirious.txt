"1" "Angel In Disguise
Delirious

Wake me up, shake me up
Break me up and the put me back together
Take my crown, let me drown
Bring me round then stay with me forever
I've never known love like this
Maybe you're an angel in disguise

Call my name,
Somebody take me away
Rescue me, completely.
No more shame,
Somebody take it away.
Rescue me.

Wake me up, take me up,
Feel the heat it's closer now than ever.
Secrets hide in the sand,
Take these bones and put me back together.
Oh, oh you're killing me, with just one kiss.
Maybe I'm an Angel in your eyes."
