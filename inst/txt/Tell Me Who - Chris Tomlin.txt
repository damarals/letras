"1" "Tell Me Who
Chris Tomlin

tell me who, who, who
can do the things You do
ain't nobody now
ain't nobody never

tell me who put the sun and stars in place
who-put the outer into space
who-put a nose on every face
who-put a wave on every sea
who-put the breath in you and me
who-put the sting in the bumblebee

tell me who-put the warm in the fire's glow
who-put the cold in the winter snow
who-put the wet in H2O
who-put the bang in the thundercloud
who-put the groundhog in the ground
who-put the milk in the farmer's cow"
