"1" "God Will Smile Up Above
MÃºsicas Gospel

In a world that is sad, There's so much to be had.
There's love all around, just waiting to be found.
God gives us a choice, Our hearing and our voice.
He has love for you and me that we can feel and see.

If I were a poet, I'd dazzle you with words,
If I could be a singer, You'd like what was heard.
If I had to fight, I'd fight for your love,
And when I would win, God will smile up above.

There are things that I am, but I am still a man.
I am coming after you, I want a love that's true.
I have made up my mind, That I want you for mine.
God will Smile up above,When I win your love.If I were a poet, I'd dazzle you with words,
If I could be a singer, You'd like what was heard.
If I had to fight, I'd fight for your love,
And when I would win, God will smile up above."
