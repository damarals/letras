"1" "Rythms Of Grace
Hillsong United

My life is a life for your cause
My will laid aside for your call
And reserved all the depth Of my heart
Only for You

I?m caught in the rhythms of grace
They overcome all of my ways
We align in each step that we take
To live for Your glory

CHORUS
There?s none beside You God
There?s none beside You God

You?re there in dark of the night
While holding the sun and its light
Through the triumph and trials alike
There?s no one beside You

Your voice calls the stars by their name
You whisper them all to their place
To testify of Your wonder and praise
Both now and forever

I live my life to shine Your light
?Cause there is none beside You God

No eye has seen
No ear has heard
The depths of Your love Lord
No mind can fathom
The love You deserve
How great You are"
