"1" "Fight Inside
Red

Enemy, familiar friend
My beginning and my end
Knowing truth, whispering lies
And it hurts again
What I fear and what I try
Words I say, and what I hide
All the pain
I want it to end, but I want it again

And it finds me
The fight inside is coursing through my veins
And it's raging
The fight inside is breaking me again

I'm still the same, pursuing pain
Is it worth the lie I've gained
We both know how this will end
But I do it again

And it finds me
The fight inside it coursing through my veins
And it's raging
The fight inside is hurting me again
And it finds me
The war within me pulls me under
And without you
The fight inside is breaking me again

It's nothing
It's everything
It's nothing
It's everything
It's nothing
It's everything
It's nothing
It's EVERYTHING!

And it finds me
The fight inside is coursing through my veins
And it's raging
The fight inside is hurting me again
And it finds me
The war within me pulls me under
And without you
The fight inside is breaking me again

IT'S BREAKING ME!
IT'S BREAKING ME!

I'M FALLING APART!
I'M FALLING APART!"
