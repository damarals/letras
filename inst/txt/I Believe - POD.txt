P.O.D.

(ha u know some ppl just dun know what i'm talking about
but i know u understand, kuz i know u believe)

Baby i believe

and if there's somebody
then baby i believe
that somebody is you
and everything is you
kuz baby i believe

i know that u can
give it up baby give it up
and it's a simple rule

that u were meant for me
and if there's somebody
then baby i believe
that somebody is you
and everything is you
kuz baby i believe

when u came to me
to set me free

and i still believe)"
