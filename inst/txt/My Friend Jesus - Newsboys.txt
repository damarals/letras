"1" "My Friend Jesus
Newsboys

I bought a product they should not have sold
I called the help line
They put me on hold
I've been waiting for an hour
Now my phone's losing power
And I'm gonna explode
I hear, \"How may I help you today?\"
I know a very rude answer
But I'm wondering, \"˜Hey!\"

What if everybody talked like my friend Jesus
If everybody loved like my friend Jesus
If everyone forgave like my friend Jesus
It would give the world a new beginning
What if this is like an early inning?

I state my business
She puts me on hold
I'm back to thinking
I'm gonna explode
And the dog wants dinner
And the music they're playing
Is the soundtrack of hell
You say, \"Two wrongs don't make a right?\"
Just try listening to Celine Dion all night.

But if everybody talked like my friend Jesus
If everybody loved like my friend Jesus
If everyone forgave like my friend Jesus
If we want to mend world relations
Surely I can show a little patience

I've been waiting around for this world to change
Another day cut loose, another lame excuse
I've got the why and how to start here and now

Then my cellphone drops the call
And I spew out vitriol
And as my fist goes through the wall
A voice says
\"BE THE CHANGE YOU WANNA SEE!\"

'˜Cause if everybody talked like my friend Jesus
If everybody loved like my friend Jesus
If everyone forgave like my friend Jesus
What a changed world this could be

Starting now, maybe I can start the change in me"
