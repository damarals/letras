"1" "Drown (With John Legend)
Lecrae

Tell me that You'll never let me down (Down)
Down (Down)
'Cause You're my final breath before I drown (Drown)
Drown (Drown)

I'm drownin' (I'm drownin')
I'm drownin' (I'm drownin')
Lost in this world, with these waves all around me
Deep in the darkness, where it's heartless
I don't know if I can make it, I'll be honest that
I'm fadin' (I'm fadin')
I'm fadin' (I'm fadin')
Trapped and I feel like it ain't no escapin'
Down to the bottom, all these problems got me drinkin'
Might drown in this bottle, all this drama got me thinkin'

If I had one call, would You answer it?
Or would You take back all of Your promises?
'Cause I don't know who to turn to or who to trust
I don't know who to turn to or who to trust so

Tell me that You'll never let me down (Down)
Down (Down)
'Cause You're my final breath before I drown (Drown)
Drown

You're my last resort, when it's too late
You're the only one, who takes my pain away (Away)
Away
So tell me that You'll never let me down (Down)
Me down (Down)

Come save me (Come save me)
Come save me (Come save me)
'Cause I've been in way over my head lately
Shame got me sinkin'
Goin' off the deep end
Heartache took my breath away, now I'm barely breathin' and
I'm hopin' (I'm hopin')
I'm hopin' (I'm hopin')
'Cause this the only thing that keeps me sober
I feel like I'm losin' it (Yeah)
Like \"What am I doin' here? \" (Yeah, yeah)
I need You to bail me out (Please)
I need You to pull me in

If I had one call, would You answer it? (Answer it)
Or would You take back all of Your promises? (Promises)
'Cause I don't know who to turn to or who to trust (Oh, oh)
I don't know who to turn to or who to trust (So)

So tell me that You'll never let me down (Woah, oh)
Down (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
'Cause You're my final breath before I drown (Oh I don't wanna drown)
Drown (Yeah)

You're my last resort, when it's too late
You're the only one, who takes my pain away (Away)
Away (So)
So tell me that You'll never let me down (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
Me down"
