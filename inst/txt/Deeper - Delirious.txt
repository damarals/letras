"1" "Deeper
Delirious

I wanna go deeper
But I don’t know how to swim
I wanna be meeker
But have you seen this old Earth?
I wanna fly higher
But these arms won’t take me there
I wanna be
I wanna be

Maybe I could run
Maybe I could fly
To you
Do you feel the same?
When all you see is blame in me

And the wonder of it all
Is that I’m living just to fall
More in love with you
And the wonder of it all
Is that I’m living just to fall
More in love with you

I wanna go deeper
But is it just a stupid whim
I wanna be weaker
Be a help to the strong
I wanna run faster
But this old leg won’t carry me
I wanna be
I wanna be

Maybe I could run
Maybe I could fly
To you
Do you feel the same?
When all you see is blame in me

And the wonder of it all
Is that I’m living just to fall
More in love with you

And the wonder of it all
Is that I’m living just to fall
More in love with you

And the wonder of it all
Is that I’m living just to fall
More in love with you

And the wonder of it all
Is that I’m living just to fall

Maybe I could run
Maybe I could follow

It’s time to walk the path where many seem to fall
Hold me in your arms
Just like any father would

How long do we have to wait?
How long?
We’re goin’ all the way

And the wonder of it all
Is that I’m living just to fall
More in love with you

And the wonder of it all
Is that I’m living just to fall
More in love with you

The wonder of it all…

And the wonder of it all…

The wonder of it all…

And the wonder of it all
Is that I’m fallin, fallin, fallin"
