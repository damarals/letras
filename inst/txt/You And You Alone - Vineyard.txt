"1" "You And You Alone
Vineyard

Your Kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
That You would rule
You would reign
On earth as You do in heaven

All for Your glory, all for Your worth
That You would be praised
All for Your honor, all for Your plan
For the sake of Your Name

Chorus:
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
That You and You alone are God
Let every nation sing
Every heart proclaim
That You and You alone are God"
