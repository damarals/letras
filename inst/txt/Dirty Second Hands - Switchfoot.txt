"1" "Dirty Second Hands
Switchfoot

Please don't be so naive
No, you're not fooling anyone
You're not as tough as you think
The dirty second hands
The dirty second hands
Can't get nothing for free
It becomes so predictable
You start fighting to breathe
The dirty second hands
The dirty second hands

Here's the face of everything that breaks it down
Now you face the face of everything that breaks you down

With an army of me
We invent our own enemies
Man verses machine
And the dirty second hands
The dirty second hands
In the land of the free
And the home of the remedy
The old clock is a thief
WIth dirty second hands
With dirty second hands

Here's the face of everything that breaks it down
Now you face the face of everything that breaks you down

Are you really as tough as you think
You blink and you're over the brink
You bleed but the blood runs pink
With dirty second hands
Dirty second hands
You're not quite as tough as you thought
You bought the American wrought
The very scene that you thought you'd shot
With dirty second hands
Dirty second hands
You might be right
The fight might be right inside you
Know the blind leading the lied to
So not leaving you blind
You with dirty second hands

Here's the face of everything that breaks it down
You bind you with dirty second hands
Now you face the face of everything that breaks you down
You bind you with dirty second hands
Now you face the face of everything that breaks you down
