"1" "In A Perfect World
MÃºsicas Gospel

In our lives we'll come to know pain,
Feel our hurt and to live with shame.
But these things will help us grow,
These are things we're meant to know.

In a perfect world, we'd live our dreams,
We could go fishing and swim in streams.
All over the world would just be smiles,
And God would have no need for files.

Chorus:
The sun would shine, we'd tell no lies,
There would be no reasons for alibis.
In a perfect world a boy get his girl,
No one is hungry, and no one cries.

The Lord would talk with everyone,
Living life would be nothing but fun.
No one would hurt, no one would die,
We'd all get our wings so we could fly.

We'd have a world that's full of love,
We would live like heaven above.
Every road would be paved of gold,
There would be no lonely souls.

Chorus:
The sun would shine, we'd tell no lies,
There would be no reasons for alibis.
In a perfect world a boy get his girl,
No one is hungry, and no one cries."
