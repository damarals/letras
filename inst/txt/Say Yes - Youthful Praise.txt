Verse:
So you struggle in the way,
you feel as though with Christ,
there's no struggle, there's no pain.

But God, He knows the path you take,
it is He who has ordained
(some struggles and some pain).

(He just wants to know if you'll)
(give up your will for His will),
(will you give up your ways for His ways),
(will you trust and obey come what may);
(will you tell God, yes)?

Chorus:
Say, yes, to His way,
God's way is the best way for you.

Say, yes, to His way,
God's way is the best way.
