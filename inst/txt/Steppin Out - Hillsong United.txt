"1" "Steppin' Out
Hillsong United

(verse 1)
We're a generation saved by grace
And set apart to change this land
We're standing strong and pressing on
We know in Jesus we can

(chorus 1)
The church of God is growing everyday
We're taking ground
And we are steppin' out
(Change our generation)
We're steppin' out
(Reachin' every nation)
With the favour of God on us day by day
We're movin' on in every way
We're steppin' out
We're steppin' out

(verse 2)
We're the chosen few who speak His Word
And manifest it in our lives
We're not moved by what the world says
God Jesus on our side

(chorus 2)
We're not dismayed by
what we see with our eyes
We walk by faith
And we are steppin' out
(Change our generation)
We're steppin' out
(Reachin' every nation)
With the favour of God on us day by day
We're movin' on in every way
We're steppin' out
We're steppin' out

With the favour of God on us day by day
We're movin' on in every way
We're steppin' out
We're steppin' out

(Change our generation)
We're steppin' out
(Reachin' every nation)
We're steppin' out!"
