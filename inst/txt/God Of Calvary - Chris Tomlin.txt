"1" "God Of Calvary
Chris Tomlin

On the hill of calvary
The light of all the world
With the world on his shoulders
The weight of all our shame
On him who knew no sin
A holy surrender

The sky went dark, the angels wept
The father looked away
The final breath he bowed his head
The lamb of god was slain

By his wounds, I am set free!
By his blood, I've been redeemed!
The great divide he crossed for me!
Oh, praise the god of calvary!

On the hill of calvary
Into the father's hands
A holy surrender a borrowed
Tomb his mother wept
And there his body lay
But the stone was moved
He conquered death and rose up
From the grave!

And if I never
Never lose sight of this place
I will never, never lose sight of your grace
Your cross is all, all I need to see
Oh, praise the god of calvary!

By his wounds, I am set free!
By his blood, I've been redeemed!
The great divide he crossed for me!
Oh, praise the god of calvary!
Your cross is all, all I need to see
Oh, praise the god of calvary!"
