"1" "Carry Us On
Gaither Vocal Band

Through our tears and our pain
When the whole world seems
So unexplained
Oh Father, carry us on.

Through the shouts and the fears
When this angry world
Makes our way seem unclear
Holy Father, oh carry us on.

Carry us on, Holy Father
Carry us on through your Son
Gives us the strength to move on
When our strength is gone
Holy Father, carry us on.

Sometimes hates in our hearts
Can tear brothers and sisters apart.
Oh, but Father, yes
We know you'll carry us on.

And as long as we have love
And we look to the Heaven's above
Oh Father
You're gonna carry us on.

Carry us on, Holy Father
Carry us on through your Son
Gives us the strength to move on
When our strength is gone
Holy Father, carry us on,
Holy Father, carry us on.

Billy Graham:
\"God cares for us. Whatever our ethnic, religious or political background may be, He's the God of all comfort, who comforts us in our troubles. 'God is our refuge and strength, an everpresent help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the Earth give away and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea'. God understands our sin and our suffering. For He took upon Himself, in the person of Jesus Christ, our sins and our suffering. And from the cross God declares: \"I love you. I know the heartaches, and the sorrows and the pains that you feel, but I love you\". My prayer today is that we would feel the loving arms of God wrapped around us. And we'll know in our hearts that He'll never forsake us as we trust in Him\".

Carry us on.

Carry us on, Holy Father
Oh carry us on through your Son, Lord Jesus
Gives us the strength to move on
Oh yeah, when our strength is gone, yeah.
Holy Father, carry us on."
