Amy Grant

She said you were upset,
I never knew
He said you were about
To come unglued
She said he said I said it was true
Everybody's talkin but you
Say what you want to say
What you want to, dear
What you want to say
Not what I want to hear
What you want to say
What you want to, dear
What you want to say
Right here
Time's up, time's a'wastin', time to explore
All the feelin's that you tend to ignore
Step up give it a shot, you've got the floor
I can take it, give me what for
Say what you want to say
What you want to, dear
What you want to say
Not what I want to hear
What you want to say
What you want to, dear
What you want to say
Right here
Will you look at your life; never gets old
Keep stuff bottled up inside, you could explode
Who cares how it sounds, you never know
Maybe it could lighten your load
Say what you want to say
What you want to, dear
What you want to say
Not what I want to hear
What you want to say
What you want to, dear
What you want to say
Right here"
