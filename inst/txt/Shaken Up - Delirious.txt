"1" "Shaken Up
Delirious

I'm shaken up I'm falling down
I'm feeling like the rug's been pulled
Beneath my feet there's shifting ground
I'm reaching out I need your hand

I'm waiting here In my living room
I'll play for you and I'll yell like a madman
Come sing to me like a father would
And still my heart with your melodies

I'm calling out to you
Embrace me again
I'm crying out to you
Come meet me again

I'll suffocate won't you let me out
I'm asking you where's the treasure now
Oh you have my heart, only you can know
I'm searching more now than I've ever
Searched before"
