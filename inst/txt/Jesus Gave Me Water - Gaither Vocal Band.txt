"1" "Jesus Gave Me Water
Gaither Vocal Band

Oh, Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water
Oh, let his praises swell
Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water
And it was not in the well
There was a woman from samaria
Came to the well to get some water
There she met a stranger who did a story tell

That woman dropped her pitcher
Her drinking was made richer
From the water he gave her
And it was not in the well
Oh, he gave her water
Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water
Oh, let his praises swell!
Jesus gave her water
He gave that woman water
Livin, lovin, lastin water

And it was not in the well
On that woman he took pity
She ran back to the city
Crying, \"glory, hallelujah! \"
And did his wonders tell
She left my savior singing
She came back to him bringing
The time she had her water, lord
And it was not in the well
Yes, he gave her water

Jesus gave her water
Yes, Jesus gave her water
Oh, let his praises swell!
Jesus gave that woman water
He gave her that livin, lovin, lastin water
Wa-a-a-ter
And it was not in the well
Lord, that woman left him shoutin
There was no room for doubtin
That she had made her savior
Who did his wonders tell

Every time shed doubt him
Shed start to think about him
The man who gave her water, lord
And it was not in the well
Yes, Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water
Oh, let his praises swell
I tell you he gave that woman water
He gave her that lovin, lastin water
Water, water, water, water, water
And it was not in the well"
