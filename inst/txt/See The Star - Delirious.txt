"1" "See The Star
Delirious

See the Star that's breaking through
To shine upon this head of mine and the people who
Are running for the goal ahead
And we won't stop 'til we reach the end

This day it's time to fix our eyes
I'm living for the greatest prize

So we run, never stop, keep my feet on the road
So we run, never stop, set my feet on the road

We live the life and dream the dream
But what you gonna do when walls come down and fall on you
Pick up your head and feel the sun
Cos we won't stop 'til the race is won

Today I'm walking in the light
We'll keep this flame that's burning bright

So we run, never stop, keep my feet on the road
So we run, never stop, set my feet on the road
So we run, never stop, keep my feet on the road
So we run, never stop, I'm feeling sweet upon the rock"
