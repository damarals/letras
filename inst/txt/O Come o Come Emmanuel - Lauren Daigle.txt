"1" "O Come o Come Emmanuel
Lauren Daigle

O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear

O come thou days bring calm and cheer
Our spirits by thy name appear
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And as dark shadows put to flight
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee O Israel

O come, desire of nations, bind
All peoples in one heart and mind
Bid envy, strife and quarrels cease
Fill the whole world with HeavenÂ’s peace
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Shall come to you, O Israel"
