"1" "Thankful And Glad
MÃºsicas Gospel

I was at the bottom of a pit,
And couldn't crawl out of it.
There was no love in the air.
And I didn't like it there. There was no one else around,
I didn't like what I found.
I tried climbing out but fell,
And figured this must be hell.

I awoke, and I was sitting up in bed
With all I imagined still in my head.

I looked around and found joy
Seeing my wife and little boy.
The dream showed me all I had,
And made me thankful and glad.

If I had counted my blessings,
I wouldn't now be confessing.
The dream helped me to see
All that God had given me.

Sometimes when we need help,
And we're blinded ourselves.
That's when God will intervene,
Showing us what we hadn't seen.

I looked around and found joy
Seeing my wife and little boy.
The dream showed me all I had,
And made me thankful and glad."
