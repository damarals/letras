"1" "I Can't Take The Pain
Third Day

VERSE 1
No I didn’t see this one coming
Suddenly it snuck up on me
Well I can’t say you didn’t tell me so
Well I can’t say you didn’t warn me

CHORUS
Well I can’t take the pain of knowing that I left you
And I can’t bear the shame of knowing I was wrong
But I’ll take the blame for everything that I’ve done
But I can’t take the pain of leaving you alone
Leaving you alone

VERSE 2
Well I was there when they accused you
But I guess I was too afraid
Not just once, and not just twice
But three times I denied your name

CHORUS
Well I can’t take the pain of knowing that I left you
And I can’t bear the shame of knowing I was wrong
But I’ll take the blame for everything that I’ve done
But I can’t take the pain of leaving you alone
Leaving you alone

BRIDGE
Well I never thought I’d get even a second chance
But you gave me that and so much more
And then for every time I ever did deny
You asked me if I love you
You know I do Lord

VERSE 3
So I’m off to follow in your steps
It won’t be easy it’s safe to say
There are only two roads I can walk on down
The one less traveled is the one you take

CHORUS
Well I cant take the pain of knowing that I left you
And I can’t bear the shame of knowing I was wrong
But I’ll take the blame for everything that I’ve done
But I can’t take the pain of leaving you alone

But you took the pain even though I left you
And you took the shame and you made it all your own
Why’d you take the blame for everything that I’ve done
But you took the pain you and you alone, you and you alone
You and you alone
