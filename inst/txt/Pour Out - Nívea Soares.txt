"1" "Pour Out
NÃ­vea Soares

I wanna pour out my all to You.
I empty myself of all my religious ways.
I wanna pour out my all to You.
I leave behind my need for recognition
And everything that keeps me from You, Jesus.
I wanna pour out my all to You.
I wanna let go of my disappointment.
I wanna pour out my all to You.
To be realesed from the prison of the past
And everything that keeps me from You, Jesus.
Where can I go, oh Lord?
For only You have the words of eternal life.
Where can I hide, oh Lord?
You are the air that I breath,
Your presence capture my heart.
Flood me with your love,
Transform me with your love,
Draw my heart to you, oh Lord,
Move me with your love
And use me for your praise alone,
teach me how to hear your heart, oh God.

I pour out my heart to You, Lord.
So take me in your arms of love"
