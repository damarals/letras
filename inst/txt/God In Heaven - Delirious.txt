"1" "God In Heaven
Delirious

In this world I don’t belong
But I’m living it
I’ve found the words to heaven’s song
Now I’m singing it
Songs of freedom, words of love
Reveal the saving grace of God
The sound of heaven on this earth
We’ll sing

To God in heaven, be the glory
To God in heaven, be the glory
Great things my Saviour, he has done
And greater things are yet to come

We’ve got this treasure in our hands
And we’re bringing it
A hidden church bell in this land
Now we’re ringing it
Our heroes lived and died to see
These words of glory set us free
To live for heaven on this earth
We’ll sing"
