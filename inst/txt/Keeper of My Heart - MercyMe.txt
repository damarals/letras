verse
When the mighty rivers flow I see You
With every drop of rain Your grace in view
In all of creation your glory's shown
But only in my heart do You call home
And I worship You, I worship You
For only in my heart do you call home
chorus
Keeper of my heart, faithfully see
This air of praise your children bring (repeat)
