"1" "Jesus Is
Hillsong United

(Verse)
Glory, glory all around
As the universe resounds
And we proclaim that He is Lord
Eternity echoes the song
Creation joining in as one
And we proclaim that He is Lord

(Pre-Chorus)
Heavens cry, my heart sings
Jesus is
Lord of all heaven and earth
Jesus is

(Chorus)
Glorious the greatest of all
Jesus is, Jesus is
Evermore, the King above all
Jesus is, Jesus is"
