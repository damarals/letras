"x"
"1" "Afterlife
Switchfoot

I've tasted fire
I'm ready to come alive
I can't just shut it up
And fake that I'm alright

I'm ready now
I'm not waiting for the afterlife

I let it burn away
The sunlight burns my skin
The way I feel inside
The way the day begins

I'm ready now
I'm not waiting for the other side
I'm ready now
I'm ready now

- Chorus -
Cause every day
A world is made
A chance to change
But I feel the same
And I wonder why would I wait till I die
To come alive
I'm ready now
I'm not waiting for the afterlife

I still believe we can live forever
You and I, we're here forever now
Forever now, forever

I still believe in us together
You and I, we're here together now
forever now, forever now, or never now

- Chorus -
Cause every day
A world is made
A chance to change
But I feel the same
And I wonder why would I wait till I die
To come alive
I'm ready now
I'm not waiting for the afterlife

Every day a choice is made
Everyday I choose my fate

And I wonder why would I wait till I die
To come alive
To come alive
Every day
Every day
Every day
I still feel the same
And I wonder why would I wait till I die
To come alive

I'm ready now
I'm not waiting for the afterlife
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready
I'm ready now
I'm not waiting for the afterlife"
