"1" "Until The Whole World Hears
Casting Crowns

Lord I wanna feel with Your heart
And see the world through Your eyes
I wanna be Your hands and feet
I wanna live a life that leads

(Chorus)

Ready yourselves
Ready yourselves
Let us shine the light of Jesus in the darkest night
Ready yourselves
Ready yourselves
May the powers of darkness tremble as our praises
rise
Until the whole world hears Lord we are calling out
Lifting up your name for all to hear the sound
Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out
As the day draws near
We'll sing until the whole world hears

Lord let your sleeping giant arise
Catch the demons by surprise
Holy nation sanctified
Let this be our battle cry

(Chorus)
Sing until the whole world hears
Sing until the whole world hears

Want to be your hands and feet
Want to be a life that leads
To see you set the captive free
Until the whole world hears
And I pray that they will see
More of you and less of me
Lord, I want my life to be
The song you sing
Until the whole world hears Lord we are calling out
Lifting up your name for all to hear the sound
Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out
As the day draws near
We'll sing until the whole world hears
Sing until the whole world hears
Sing until the whole world hears
Sing until the whole world hears
Sing until the whole world hears
Sing until the whole world hears"
