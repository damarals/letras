"x"
"1" "Lean On Me
Kirk Franklin

This is for that little child with no father
For that man that doesn't have a place to stay
For that little boy living with AIDS
Can I tell you a story, tell you a story
You can lean on me

There's a man (oh yes)
Standing on the corner
He has no home
He has no food
And his blue skies are gone (yes it is)
Can't you hear him cryin' out

And there's a girl
Searching for a father and a friend
Praying that the storm someday will end
But instead of walking away
Open up your heart and say

[Chorus:]
I am here
You don't have to worry
I can see...
I can see your tears....your tears
I'll be there in a hurry when you call
Yes I will
Friends are there to catch you when you fall
Here's my shoulder
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me





Oh, there's a child
Who is sick and begging to be free
But there is no cure for his disease
He looks up to his mother and

As she hold (holds), his hand (hand)
Prayin' that someday
The sun will shine again
And the pain?
And the pain will end
Pain will end....Come on

I am here
I am here
You don't have to worry
You don't have to worry
I can see...
I see...
....your tears
....your tears, yeah
I'll be there in a hurry when you call
I'll be there in a hurry when you call
Friends are there to catch you when you fall
I'm your friend and I'll catch you when,
when, when you fall
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me


Tell me, how can I, how can I love Jesus
When I've never seen His face
Yeah, I see you dying
And I turn and walk away

So hold my hand

Let me take you to a friend of mine
He's waiting just to ease your troubled mind
Yeah, yeah, He loves you more than you'll ever
know
'Stead of walking away
Open up
Open up your heart and say
Come on

I am here
I am here
You don't have to worry
I can see your tears
I'll be there in a hurry when you call
Alleluia

When you call, friends will be
there to catch you when, catch you when you fall
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me
Thank you Jesus, yeah
OhYeah, oh yeah
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me
You can lean on me
Lean on me, yeah, yeah Intro

This is for that little child with no father
For that man that doesn't have a place to stay
For that little boy living with AIDS
Can I tell you a story, tell you a story
You can lean on me

you are my friend, but you are also my brother."
