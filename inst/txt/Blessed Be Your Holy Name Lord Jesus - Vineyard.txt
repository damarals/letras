Vineyard

Blessed be Your holy name Lord Jesus
I will never cease to give You praise
You are Messiah, Deliverer
The Holy One of Israel

Blessed be Your holy name Lord Jesus
There's no other name by which we're saved
You are Messiah, Deliverer
Blessed be Your name

Your name is high above all others
Your name has set the captives free
Your name delivers all the nations
Your name is life and breath to me"
