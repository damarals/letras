"1" "Dusty Road
Michael W. Smith

Dusty road, buried dreams, pieces on the ground
Saw the ghosts of empty streets, of that West Virginia town
You worked for years on swing shift at the oil refinery

You loved your wife and your kids, and one of those kids was me
And the sweat upon your brow was like the tears of Heaven pouring out
You said, keep walking on down, down this dusty road
We're gonna make it somehow

Now I wish that you were here, you'd be amazed to see
That today looks like a page torn from 1933
In my dreams to you I run, in golden fields where angels kiss the Sun
You say, keep walking on down, down this dusty road
We're gonna make it somehow

I can feel it, feel it in my bones
That there's a place up ahead that looks like home
We keep walking on down, down this dusty road
We're gonna make it somehow (Make it somehow)
We're gonna make it somehow
Yes, we are

And a peace comes to me now
Like a steady hand to lead us out
We keep walking on down, down this dusty road
We're gonna make it somehow
I can feel it, feel it in my bones

That there's a place up ahead that looks like home
We keep walking on down, down this dusty road
We're gonna make it somehow (Make it somehow)
We're gonna make it somehow
Yes, we are"
