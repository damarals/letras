"1" "All I Need to Say
Michael W. Smith

Words & Music:Gary Chapman, Amy Grant, and Michael W. Smith

Sad goodbye
Never quite got said
Now the time is gone
We're movin' on
Even though it hurts so bad
If I could I'd turn back the days
And I'd love again
To be your friend
In a hundred different ways
But we can't turn back the time
The days
Chorus:
So if I never said
All I needed to say
I'll say it now
You know I loved you once
I love you stronger today
Please love find me a way
Words I still need to say
But I don't know how

Can't stand still
Still I can't move on
Lord I need Your strength
Need You in me
'Cause a part of me is gone
In time I will know
What I've yet to see
That through all the pain
You hurt the same
And you're standing here with me
And more than anything it's You I need

Chorus
