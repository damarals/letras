"1" "Fan The Fire
NÃ­vea Soares

Fan the fire of your spirit
Increase the anointing
I wanna be closer to you

Restore in me the fear of your holy name
Awaken my heart to love you, Lord

Beyond the words
And the commom love songs
Let your life flow from within me now
Let my actions honor you alone
To exalt your name, Oh Lord

Jesus, you are worthy of all my life
Worthy of all that i am
You are

For you i dance
For you i shout
For you i live
Jesus"
