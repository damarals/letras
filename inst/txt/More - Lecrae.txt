(More) Your goodness, your mercy
(More) I'm hungry, I'm thirsty
(More) Your love and your grace
(More) I just need a taste
(More) Your peace and your passion
(More) Your joy and compassion
(More) You've got it, I need it
(More) I've just gotta have it

The throne of my heart, occupy and reign supreme
Kill my lust and pride and all my other ugly things
Wage your holy war inside me 'til you overcome
Let your kingdom come, and let your will be done
I was worthless I was dead, foul, nasty, dirty
I had no eyes to see or ears to hear that you were worthy
But your spirit hit me, it gave me new direction
I see the deeper things, I call it depth perception
Now your presence is my treasure, never-ending peace
And they can't keep me from your love, 'cause it'll never cease
So I pray you'll keep me, 'cause I can't keep myself
Protect me from my sin, I know I'm bad for my health
And I'm dying to know you, wake me up and let me read
Drink your word so if they cut me, this is what I bleed
Give me a double feature, give me a triple portion
I'm coming back for seconds, thirds, fourths, more, more, more!

If I don't know it, teach me please, though I'm undeserving
Don't let me lose sight of my savior, 'cause my Savior's worthy (Jesus!)
Apart from Him, I'm zip, zero, zilch, nada, nothing
No point in acting like I'm somebody to prove somethin'
Open my understanding, when I read the scriptures
And still your Word inside a darkened wretch, unholy sinner
Make me acquainted with your covenants and perfect plans
Humble me by showing me the world is in your hands
Lead me in the truth, wisdom, revelation
Apply your blood to my dirty soul for salvation
And help me believe, Lord lead me to faith
Just teach me your ways, I'm in need of your grace (I need ya!)
Purify my heart, fill me with your spirit
Occupy me with your presence, keep your servant near
Give me faith to behold, write your name on my soul
Make me whole for your glory and your name to be known!

A sinner, I understand my state
I know my sins are numberless, iniquities are great
But you are adequate [pronounced adakwate], I mean you adequate
To cleanse me from my nonsense, from it I repent
I'm never satisfied, more, more, I gotta grow
Adding to my faith, virtue, knowledge, and self-control
You're all I need to know, the only one I crave
If I can't have you every day, then take me to my grave
Help me to pray in faith, leaning up on your will
Strengthen me with conviction, show me the sins that kill
Nothing exceeds your power, nothing too great a task
Never too much to hope for, nothing too small to ask
Wisdom is unsurpassed, begging to see your face
Itching to see your glory, burning for your embrace
All I know is I want it, people don't understand
They never tasted anything great as the Great I am
I gotta have more!

(More) Your goodness, your mercy
(More) I'm hungry, I'm thirsty
(More) Your love and your grace
(More) I just need a taste
(More) Your peace and your passion
(More) Your joy and compassion
(More) You've got it, I need it
(More) I've just gotta have it

(More) Yeah I need more
(More) Yeah I need more
(More) Yeah I need more
(More) Lord give me more!
(More) Yeah I need more
(More) Yeah I need more
(More) Yeah I need more
(More) Lord give me more!"
