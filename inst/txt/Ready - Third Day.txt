Third Day

I'm ready for the winds to change
I'm ready for a brighter day
I'm ready for the sun to shine down on me
I'm waiting for a song to sing
I'm looking for a brand new thing
I'm ready now to live a life that I believe

I want the world to turn because of love
And mercy to find each of us
Doing what we can to just believe
I want the world to know that You're the One
Who fills me up and gives me hope
And brings about this change that's in me
Oh yeah, I'm ready, yeah
You know I'm ready now

I'm ready for the truth to be
Something that can set us free
Does anybody still believe we'll make it through
I'm ready now to take a stand
To live life for more than myself
Tell me now, my friend, are you ready, too

I can't sit around waiting for it all to change
It's gonna take every single one of us doing what we can
There's lots of fighting in this world but there's
so much loving, too
So take my hand, I'm ready now for you

Lord knows I'm ready
You know I'm ready
I'm ready for the winds to change
I'm ready for a brighter day"
