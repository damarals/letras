"1" "All Of Creation
MercyMe

Separated until the veil was torn
The moment that hope was born
And guilt was pardoned once and for all

Captivated but no longer bound by chains
Left at an empty grave
The sinner and the sacred resolved

[chorus:]
And all of creation sing with me now
Lift up your voice and lay your burden down
And all of creation sing with me now
Fill up the heavens let his glory resound

Time has faded and we see him face to face
Every doubt erased forever we will worship the king

[repeat chorus]

Ohh ah ohh... ohh ah ohh

The reason we breathe is to sing of his glory
And for all he has done praise the father
Praise the son and the spirit in one

[repeat chorus

And every knee will bow oh and every tongue
Praise the father praise the son and the spirit in one"
