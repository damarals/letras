"1" "Because Of The Lord's Great Love
Vineyard

Yet this will I call to mind
And therefore I will hope
Because of the Lord's great love
I've been redeemed.

The Lord is gracious and kind
To all who call on his name
Because of the Lord's great love
I've been redeemed.

Because of the Lord's great love (3x)
I've been redeemed.

I know of his steadfast love
His mercy renewed each day
Because of the Lord's great love
I've been redeemed.

Washed in the blood of the Lamb
Guiltless forever I stand
Because of the Lord's great love
I've been redeemed."
