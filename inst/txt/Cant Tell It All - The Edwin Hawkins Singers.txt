"1" "Can't Tell It All
The Edwin Hawkins Singers

1st Verse
When I look back over my life
I think about what God has done for me
So much, He has done
And I just can’t tell it all

Choir
I just can’t tell it all
He’s been my all and all
I just can’t tell it all

Lead
What the Lord has done for me

2nd Verse
When I think of His goodness and all He has done for me
My soul cries out Hallelujah
Praise God for saving me…

Choir
I just can’t tell it all
He’s been my all and all
I just can’t tell it all

Lead
Oh what the Lord has done for me

Lead
And this is one thing I wanna tell you
When I was sick one day, he healed my body yes He did (That’s what He’s done for me) and I’m able to tell it
He gave me a song that the angels can’t sing (That’s what He’s done for me) Glory Hallelujah, I’ve been redeemed
That’s what my God has done for me
I’d like to say one more thing
Out of the muck and miry clay He picked me up, yes He did (That’s what He’s done for me)
Oh, then He placed my feet on a solid rock to stay, yes He did (That’s what He’s done for me)
That’s what He’s done for me

Vamp
I can’t
No I
Just can’t
I just can’t it all"
