"1" "I Want To Live
Skillet

In a grave of roses
While the night is closing in
My soul is so cold
But I want to live again
I know you'll come to me
I wait in misery
I want to fight for this
Save me from this darkness
I reach for the light

I want to live my life
The choice is mine, I've made up my mind
Now, I'm free to start again
The way I want to live
(to live) and breathe (and breathe)
The way I want that's right for me
I may not know nothing else
But I know this, I want to live

All I ever needed was a reason to believe
You help me hold on
You ignite the fire in me
You always come for me
You know just what I need
Don't make me wait for this
Save me from this darkness
I reach for the light

I want to live my life
The choice is mine, I've made up my mind
Now, I'm free to start again
The way I want to live
(to live) and breathe (and breathe)
The way I want that's right for me
I may not know nothing else
But I know this, I want to live

I'm breathing, still breathing
But I can't fight this fear alone
This feeling is killing slow
But now I know

I want to live my life
The choice is mine, I've made up my mind
Now, I'm free to start again
The way I want to live
(to live) and breathe (and breathe)
The way I want that's right for me
I may not know nothing else
But I know this, I want to live
I want to live
I know this, I want to live"
