"1" "Take My Breath Away
Michael W. Smith

Glory so beautiful
The earth displays your majesty
How could you ever be
So mindful of someone as me
You captive
Splendor I have never seen
Nothing else can compare
You're infinite, you're everywhere

(CHORUS)
You're everything I can't explain
You set my heart on fire
And here I stand amazed
You take me breath away
You take me breath away
See me, all I am

These empty hands are all I can give
That you would die so I'd live
Your sacrifice I can't believe
You fascinate
You stole my heart, I can't forget
And now that I've felt your love
No turning back, I can't get enough

(BRIDGE)
Whit just one word
Whit just one glance
I'm lost in this divine romance
And every single day more than I can say
You take my breath away

(CHORUS)
You're everything I can't explain
You set my heart on fire
And here I stand amazed
You take me breath away
The morning breaks, my soul awakes
You are my one desire
And I here stand amazed
You take my breath away

Oh Oh Oh - Oh Oh Oh - Oh Oh Oh
You take my breath away
Oh Oh Oh - Oh Oh Oh - Oh Oh Oh
You take my breath away
You take my breath away"
