"1" "Tomorrow
Amy Grant

Lay down your failures and excuses,
All of the dreams that never come true;
The past is a crutch you've been using;
Time you broke that thing in two.
Open your eyes to tomorrow.
Open your life to His care.
Open your past to His mercy.
Open your heart, He'll be there.

We've got tomorrow;
There'll be changes made inside.
We've got tomorrow;
Gonna take it all in stride.
If we just follow,
God will lead us to His side.
If this day went wrong
You gotta pick up,
You gotta move on to tomorrow.

Yesterday's gone for forever.
We'll never change a thing we've done.
But the guilt is behind us,
If our heart's moving on.
Never give an inch (never give an inch) to disbelieving;
What God said, He's gonna do,
And He said when He started,
He's never gonna quit until He's through.

We've got tomorrow;
Don't let trouble fill your head.
We've got tomorrow;
You gotta believe what He said.
Just follow. He'll be here until the end,
So keep hanging on,
Until you pick up,
Until you move on to tomorrow.

I know some things can take time.
But I believe He changes minds.
Tell me when are you gonna see?
All you gotta do is believe!

We've got tomorrow;
There'll be changes made inside.
We've got tomorrow;
Gonna take it all in stride.
If we just follow,
God will lead us to His side.
If this day went wrong
You gotta pick up,
You gotta move on to tomorrow (tomorrow).

Don't let trouble fill your head.
We've got tomorrow (tomorrow);
You gotta believe what He said.
And follow (follow). He'll be here until the end,
So keep hanging on,
Until you pick up,
Until you move on until tomorrow (tomorrow).

There'll be changes made inside.
We've got tomorrow (tomorrow);
Gonna take it all in stride.
If we just follow (follow);
God will lead us to His side.
If this day went wrong
You gotta pick up,
You gotta move on to tomorrow (tomorrow).

Don't let trouble fill your head.
Tomorrow (tomorrow).
You gotta believe what He said.
Just follow (follow). He'll be here until the end,
So keep hanging on,
Until you pick up,
Until you move on to tomorrow (tomorrow).
