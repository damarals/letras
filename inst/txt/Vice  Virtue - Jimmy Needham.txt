"x"
"1" "Vice & Virtue
Jimmy Needham

All my sins go to private school
All my sins know the golden rule
All my sins hold the door for you
There's vice in all my virtue

Even my nice tries are misfires
Even my best lines are white lies
Even the demons do this too
There's vice in all my virtue

I treat You more like a rabbit's foot
If I hold on tight You'll do me good
Less like love more like voodoo
I got vice in all my virtue

Hell's gonna have an Hoa
Hell's gonna have a low crime rate
If we don't watch out it'll have us too
There's vice in all my virtue

I'm losing sleep about it
Don't wanna be without Ya
Can't even breathe without Ya
Help me, yeah

On my own without Ya
All alone without Ya
There ain't no hope
Without Ya, help me

Oh my my my my
My good is never good enough
Good enough
Way way way down deep
There is a criminal in us
Down in us

Which is good and which is bad
Crystal meth or a gospel tract?
If it's done for me and not for You
There's vice in all my virtue

Businessmen and soccer moms
College kids and debutantes
Caiphas and Judas too
There's vice in all my virtue

I'm losing sleep about it
Don't wanna be without Ya
Can't even breathe without Ya
Help me, yeah

On my own without Ya
All alone without Ya
There ain't no hope
Without Ya, help me

I'm losing sleep about it
Don't wanna be without Ya
Can't even breathe without Ya
Help me, yeah

Oh my my my my
My good is never good enough
Good enough
Way way way down deep
There is a criminal in us
Down in us

On my own without Ya
All alone without Ya
There ain't no hope
Without Ya, help me

I'm losing sleep about it
Don't wanna be without Ya
Can't even breathe without Ya
Help me, yeah

On my own without Ya
All alone without Ya
There ain't no hope
Without Ya, help me"
