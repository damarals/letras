"1" "His Eye Is On Sparrow
Newsboys

Why should I be discouraged
Why should the shadows come
Why should my heart be lonely
And long for heaven and home
When Jesus is my portion?
My constant friend is he
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches me

And I sing because I'm happy
And I sing because I'm free
For his eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches me
\"Let not your heart be troubled, \"
His tender word I hear
And resting on his goodness
I lose my doubts and fears

And I sing because I'm happy
And I sing because I'm free
For his eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches me
Though by the path he leadeth
But one step I may see
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches me

And I sing because I'm happy
And I sing because I'm free
For his eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches me
For his eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches me"
