"1" "When We All Get Together With The Lord
Gaither Vocal Band

Now when the rich and the poor
Get together with the Lord
Get together, get together with the Lord
They'll treat each other like sister and brother
When they all get together with the Lord

Now when we all get together
When we all get together with the Lord
They'll treat each other like sister and brother
When they all get together with the Lord

Now when the weak and the strong
Get together with the Lord
Get together, get together with the Lord
The weak are no longer, afraid of the stronger
When they all they all get together with the Lord

Now when we all get together
When we all get together with the Lord
The weak are no longer afraid of the stronger
When we all get together with the Lord

Now when the tall and the small
Get together with the Lord
Get together, get together with the Lord
They'll soon realize they're all the same size
When they all get together with the Lord

Now when we all get together
When we all get together with the Lord
They'll soon realize they're all the same size
When we all get together with the Lord"
