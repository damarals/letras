"1" "Your Love Is Beautiful
Hillsong United

You surrounded me with songs of praise
You have bought me to this place
Where your love and grace, move within my life
Now Your message is my light

Your love is beautiful
Your love is beautiful
It's the reason why I sing
All around the world, let the praise begin
All around the world, let the praise begin

I am planted here by the waters and I'm living for the King
I have found my peace in the house of God
This is where I'm meant to be
