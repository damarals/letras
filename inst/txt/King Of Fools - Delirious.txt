"1" "King Of Fools
Delirious

Waiting for you
Nothing in this world can bring me
Peace and madness
They've become the very best of friends

Walking with you
Blindly follow out upon the
Water runs down
You've become the very best of friends

I'll live for you and try to be the king of fools
I'll long for you and walk before the king of all

Joy has found me
Living life without you would be
Hell or heaven
Soon we'll find the greatest king of fools

I'll live for you and try to be the king of fools
I'll long just to walk before the king of fools"
