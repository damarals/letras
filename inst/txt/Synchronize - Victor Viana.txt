"x"
"1" "Synchronize
Victor Viana

I live in a place where I don't belong
I grew in a wave of things that goes on
Don't think that anyone could see
The one thing that never shouldn't be

The world is not a thing that we should hold on
But realize that love is not a thing to call
I wish I could do all the things
That make me feel just
Like when I first saw you

I want to be in your arms
Felling your heart
And syncronize our heart beats
To see what only you see

I want to be like Jesus
Pure and simple
Light my world and wipe it off
To fill it with a firing heart"
