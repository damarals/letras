Armies from the North invading from the South
Coming so strong we ain’t got no way out
My people crying loud asking what I’m gonna do
We can’t come out on top and we got everything to lose
Hear that voice there you shall not fear
You shall not fight watch me there
Can I really stand fast while the enemies advance
But I swore to believe so no matter the chance I’ll sing

Raise the banner high
March with I and I
Lift your voices up loud and high
Strength and unity
Faith and victory
Let the battle rage on we cry

So I rose up at dawn with battle on my mind
I knew that by faith we walk and not by sight I’ve
Been waiting all night I know it’s never been done
Put the armies in the back and the singers on the front lines
Here the people sing Hallelu, his mercy reigns his
Word is true

Then something hit ‘em strong started fallen like paws
Saw the fire of Heaven as we’re singing our song I said

Armies from the north, invading from the south
Coming so strong but never got out
One by one they fell on victory’s day
By the fire of heaven and a song of praise we sang"
