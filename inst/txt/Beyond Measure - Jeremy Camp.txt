"1" "Beyond Measure
Jeremy Camp

Verse 1:

The fog has finally cleared to see,
the beautiful life you've given me.
To feel the breze of my newborns gentle breath.
With one to walk hand in hand,
to share this life that you have planned.
It's like a storybook with dreams that are meant to see.
Every next step is an extraordinary scene.

Chorus:

I know that I've been given more than beyond measure
I come alive when I see beyond my fears.
I know that I've been given more than earthly treasures
I come alive when I've broken down and given you control

Verse 2:

I've faced a great tragedy,
but have seen the works that you bring
a display of faith that you give.
I don't know if I will ever understand
the depth of what it is you'e done inside
but I know that I won't find any worth apart from you.

Chorus:

I know that I've been given more than beyond measure
I come alive when I see beyond my fears.
I know that I've been given more than earthly treasures
I come alive when I've broken down and given you control

Everything that I have has been given so unselfishly
and shown that even when I don't deserve
You always show the fullness of your love.

Chorus:

I know that I've been given more than beyond measure
I come alive when I see beyond my fears.
I know that I've been given more than earthly treasures
I come alive when I've broken down and given you control

I'm broken now and giving you control"
