"1" "The Ball And Chain
The Caravans

Now I aint been never pusky
Yes you know how hard I try
But if you love me then you leave me
Litlle gal yes you know that that aint right
Yes I gotta move out
Yes I gotta move out
Cause I'm all uptight
All tight
And if at all she don't get you baby
I'll be back, back on my ball and chain
Ball and chain

Well a baby baby got a leavin' this
I need a more than just one kiss
Litlle my heart he's gotta make her pay
I'll be back on my ball and chain yeah

Well I ain't been never down house
Yes you know it just ain't my style
Yeah come allong a baby
Use my body
Just for a litlle old while
Yes I gotta move out
Yes I gotta move out
Just for one last time
One time
And if at long she don't get you baby
I'll be back, back with the ball and chain
Ball and chain

Well a baby baby got a leavin' this
I need a more than just one kiss
Litlle my heart he's gotta make her pay
I'll be back on my ball and chain yeah"
