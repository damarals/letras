"1" "Rock The Party (Off The Hook)
P.O.D.

we came here to rock this jam
spread his love is the master plan
let this light ignite like a star
everybody in the party knows who we are
you gotta get down, dance around, floss your style
P.O.D., guarantee, make it worth your while
bad vibes leave 'em at the door
soulcheck'n, housewreck'n, keep 'em begg'n for more

we came to rock the party all night long
so party people won't you sing that song
we came here to rock the party all night long
and keep it live till the break of dawn

hey DJ won't you play that song
and we'll keep dancing till the break of dawn
keep it live like the way it should
ain't nobody gett'n crazy so you know its all good
b-boys, fly-girls one time
friend of yours is a friend of mine
don't bother stopping till this jam is through
if you been here before then you know how we do

we came to rock the party all night long
so party people won't you sing that song
we came to rock the party all night long
and keep it live till the break of dawn

last time last time c'mon

we gotz to play what we feel
then i can say i came real
don't wanna ba caught mess'n around
cuz a party ain't a party when it gets shut down
off the hook with the cut,thats right
feel'n loose cuz it sounds so tight
rock da spot till the very end
make sure that your there when we do it again

we came to rock the party all night long
so party people won't you sing that song
we came to rock the party all night long
and keep it live till the break of dawn
