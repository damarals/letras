Gaither Vocal Band

Home is where the heart is, my heart's on home!
Though I never really had one to call my own.
Now I've been givin a key by the Carpenter of Galilee!
With interest paid the title's made to me!

Home, where there is no night.
Home, where the Son is alive.
The place that I've been dreaming of so long!
Loved ones there to welcome me
but His sweet face will be the first I see!
When my journey's over I am going home.

Everbody? dreams of going home it seems,
Lately I'm no exception to the rule.
Home is so much more then windows, walls, and doors!
It's a warm embrace where a smiling face is waiting you!"
