You are my light
My breath of life
I trust in you
You fill my heart
Set me apart
I'm found in you

PRE-CHORUS
You are my one desire
You are the holy fire that burns in me
The lover of my soul
You don't let go
You've made your home in me

CHORUS
You are my everything
All I need is in You
And all I have
All I am is in You
It's in You

You overflow
My heart and soul,
Wash over me
I feel You now
Your love surrounds and covers me

CHORUS

BRIDGE
You are my desire
You are my reward
You are my desire
All I'm living for

You're all I want
You are everything
You are my desire
Come and burn in me"
