"1" "Eagle Song
Gaither Vocal Band

I study and watch the eagle fly
Spreaded wings and sort across the sky
So gracefully he flew
Rising effortlessly
I wanna to know just how to be free

Tiny fingers curled around mine
Perfect form; new born
The image of two
Infinite mystery
I wanna to know were life comes from

What human intellect canÂ´t sway
Must be explained
The way earth wisdom religions of man
Search without end
To find the spirit house within
Simplicity of God somehow scapes man

uhh...

I reach for the eternal one
Creation he was grading to review
His purpose in me
He said this is were life begins
I made your spirit to glide on the wind

Come lets fly on the wind
Come on lets fly on the wind
On the wind"
