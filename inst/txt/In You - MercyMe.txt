MercyMe

I put my hope in you
I lay my life in the palm of your hand
I'm constantly drawn to you O Lord
In ways I cannot comprehend

It's the creator calling the created
The maker beckoning the made
The bride finding what she's always waited for
When we find ourselves that day

Chorus:
In you where the hungry feast at the table
The blind frozen by colors in view
The lame will dance, they'll dance for they are able
And the weary find rest
O the weary find rest in you

It's no secret that we don't belong here
though set apart by the grace of you
We look for the day when we go to a place
Where the old become brand new

Chorus:
In you where the hungry feast at the table
The blind frozen by colors in view
The lame will dance, they'll dance for they are able
And the weary find rest
O the weary find rest in you....

where the hungry feast at the table
The blind frozen by colors in view
The lame will dance, they'll dance for they are able
And the weary find rest
O we will find rest in you

na na na na naa naa na na na na
we will find hope
(na na na na)
o we will find rest
(na na na na)
you are our refuge
(na na na na)
you are our sanctuary
(na na na na)
we come you lord
