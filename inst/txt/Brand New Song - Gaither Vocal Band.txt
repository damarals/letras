"1" "Brand New Song
Gaither Vocal Band

Today could be the day
When jesus calls me away
Up high above the sky
Where I will live and never die

So don't weep for me
When I cross over that sea
My pain will all be gone
And I will have a brand new song
To sing

Imagine a home
Where fear and doubt are never known
No war, for all is peace
Sounds like the perfect place to be

If you get there first
I'll join you on the second verse
And for eternity
You and I will have a brand new song
To sing

Uh uh uh uh uh!

Today could be the day"
