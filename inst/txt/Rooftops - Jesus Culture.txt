Here I am before you, falling in love and seeking your truth
Knowing that your perfect grace, has brought me to this place
Because of you Freely live, my life to you, Oh God, I give
So stand before you, God
I lift my voice 'cause you set me free

So I shout out Your name, from the rooftops I proclaim
That I am Yours, I am Yours

All the Good you've done for me
I lift up my hands for all to see
You're the only one, who brings me to my knees
To share this love across the earth
the beauty of Your holy worth
So I Kneel before you, God
I lift my hands cause you set me free

So I shout out Your name, from the rooftops I proclaim
That I am Yours, I am yours
All that I am, I place into your loving hands
And I am Yours, I am yours

Here I am, I stand with arms wide open
To the One, the Son, the everlasting God
the everlasting God!

Spontanuous
Here I am, arms wide open
Here I am, heart wide open
Here I am, God
Can you tell him tonight
Say Jesus here I am, here I am\"
Here I am, arms wide open
Jesus!"
