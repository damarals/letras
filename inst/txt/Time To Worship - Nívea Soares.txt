"1" "Time To Worship
NÃ­vea Soares

I hear the voice of my beloved
And he is rising up upon hte mountains
With eyes of fire and feet of bonze
His face is shinning like the sun
And with his voice of many waters
He calls me

Rise up my darling
Come away with me
Let me listen to your voice
Let me listen to you sing

Rise up my fair one
Come way with me
Let me listen to your voice
Come to worship your king

The winter is past
The rain is gone
And the flowers are springing up
The singing of birds fills the earth
I am my beloved's
And my beloved's mine
He's calling me...

His name is holy
The holy one of Israel
His name is Jesus...

Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God almighty

And the earth is filled with his glory

And my life is filled with his glory

And my life is filled with his glory

And my life will be filled with his glory

Forever
