Jesus Culture

Strip everything away till all I have is You
Undo the veils till all I see is You

Strip everything away till all I have is You
Undo the veils till all I see is You

I will pursue You, I will pursue Your presence
I will pursue You, I will pursue Your presence

I'm pressing in to You so do not pass me by
I'm breaking through the boundaries
I will not be denied

I will pursue You, I will pursue Your presence
I will pursue You, I will pursue Your presence

Open my eyes, search me inside
I cant live without Your presence
I can't live without Your presence"
