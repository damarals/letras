Day one
Drifting out at sea
No sign of land, no sign of hope for me
Rocking to and fro by the winds of complacency
I am just so tired of fighting to breathe

Day two
Or day six, day twenty, day fifthy
They're all the same, nothing changes for me
When will I ever be rescued?
When will I ever be free?
Oh God, someone hear me, someone please

But wait, oh, but wait
There is a man walking above all of this that surrounds me
He takes my hand, takes my heart
Rips me free
Rips me free
Rips me free
Rips me free

How can I ever repay you Mister
For setting my desperate soul on dry land
For signaling those storms away with a whisper
For taking all of my burdens in your hands
In your hands
In your hands

Today
Things are most certainly changed
All of my pain for all of God's hope exchanged

When will I ever be rescued
That was my desperate plea
And God you heard me
Set me free

How can I ever repay you Mister
For setting my desperate soul on dry land
For signaling those storms away with a whisper
For taking all of my burdens in your hands
In your hands"
