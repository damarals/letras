"1" "Your Great Name
Aline Barros

Lost are saved, find their way
At the sound of Your great name
All condemned, feel no shame
At the sound of Your great name

Every fear has no place
At the sound of Your great name
The enemy, he has to leave
At the sound of Your great name

Jesus, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain for us
Son of God and Man
You are high and lifted up, that all the world
Will praise Your great name

All the weak find their strength
At the sound of Your great name
Hungry souls receive grace
At the sound of Your great name

The fatherless, they find their rest
At the sound of Your great name
Sick are healed and the dead are raised
At the sound of Your great name

Jesus, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain for us
Son of God and Man
You are high and lifted up, that all the world
Will praise Your great name, Your great name, oh

Redeemer, My Healer, Lord Almighty
My Savior, Defender, You are my King
Redeemer, My Healer, Lord Almighty
My Savior, Defender, You are my King

Jesus, my Lord
Jesus

Redeemer, My Healer, Lord Almighty
My Savior, Defender, You are my King
You are my King
Jesus, Worthy is the Lamb
Your name is holy
Lord I'm lifted and I'm high
Your great name
Your great name
Jesus"
