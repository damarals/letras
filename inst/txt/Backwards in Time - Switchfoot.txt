"1" "⁠Backwards in Time
Switchfoot

If we could go back, would we take the same path?
If we knew what we know?
It feels like the future is born from the past
But the present we hold
I dangle my feet off the edge of the path
And I look down below
There goes the Sun again, there goes the time
But where does it go?

In the back of my mind
If I could go backwards in time
Before I went wrong
Before you went right, yеah
If I could go backwards in time
Before you lеt go
If I could start over tonight
If we could give this just one more try
If I could go backwards in time
Would you help me go back?

Help me go backwards to light
Before words were spoken
A million wrongs won't make it right
My heart is still broken
It's there in the back of my mind
I'm holding on hoping
Would you help me go backwards tonight?
My heart is still broken

If I could go backwards in time
Before I went wrong
Before you went right, yeah
If I could go backwards in time
Before you let go
If I could start over tonight
If we could give this just one more try
If I could go backwards in time
Would you help me go back?
Would you help me go back?

If we could go back, would we take the same path?
If we knew what we know?

If I could go backwards in time
Before I went wrong
Before you went right, yeah
If I could go backwards in time
Before you let go
Yeah, if I could start over tonight
If we could give this just one more try
If I could go backwards in time
Would you help me go back?
Would you help me go back, hey?

If I could go backwards in time"
