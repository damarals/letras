Jesus Culture

The Lord our God is high and lifted up
The glory of His Son shines upon us
The banner of His love is over us
The Lord our God is high and exalted

Who has made the world turn
Who has made the heavens shine at night
Who has set my heart on fire

The Lord our God is high and lifted up
The coming of His Kingdom upon us
The promise of His fire is over us
The Lord our God is high and exalted

All of the earth cries out for sons and daughters to be discovered
Well, here we are
Well, here we are
Well, here we are

Here we are
In Your presence, God
Hallelujah, God

Who has made the world turn
Who has set my heart on fire

You have made the world turn
You have made the heavens shine at night
You have set my heart on fire"
