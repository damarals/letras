"x"
"1" "Lay Down My Pride
Jeremy Camp

Every single word I say
You know it before I speak
You know every thought the deepest part of me
You draw me closer than I see
Your presence is every thing I need to be the child that you've created me to be
I'm ready now to see it your way

*Chorus*
I lay down my pride
My desires my demise
I'm ready now to see it your way
I'm done I'm through ignoring you
Now it's true
I'm kneeling at the cross of your grace
Lay down my pride

I was faced with passing time but I knew the choice was mine
To finally come to you and give you all control
I've wandered miles to find my way and then you revealed this simple faith
I know that you can see the secrets of my soul

*Bridge*
The cross
The blood you shed for me
Your back was ripped and bruised so I can know your love
I kneel I bow to you my King

*chorus*"
