"1" "Church On Fire
Hillsong United

The Holy Spirit is here
And his power is real
Anything can happen
And it probably will
Something very good
Something good is going on around here.

There is a light that shines
To make the dark disappear
A power at work, but there's nothing to fear
Something very good
Something good is going on around here.

This is a church on fire
This is the Holy Spirit flame
We have a burning desire
To lift up Jesus name
Let fire burn in every heart
Light the way, defeat the dark
Let the flame of love burn higher
This is a church on fire."
