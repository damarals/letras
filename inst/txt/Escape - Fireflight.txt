"1" "Escape
Fireflight

My hands are tied, they're going numb
I don't know where they've brought me
My throat's torn raw from all my screams
But no one can hear me
In the dark it seems I lose my dignity
Between the pain and tears
There's only fear

Escape (we don't want to save ourselves)
We will not be contained
(let's fly away with all the angels)
We're breaking out tonight

Searching for a crack of light
But it seems to be changing
Is the sun leaving the sky
Or is it me that is fading
In the dark unseen
I know you search for me
I feel you drawing near
You fight my fear

Escape (we don't want to save ourselves)
We will not be contained
(let's fly away with all the angels)
We're breaking out tonight
Fear is not our master anymore
Run with me, escape
We're breaking out tonight

This is our time
We can't let our fear define us
This is our time
From this nightmare we're reborn
This is our time
This is our time to escape

We will not be contained
(let's fly away with all the angels)
We're breaking out tonight
Fear is not our master anymore
Run with me, escape
We're breaking out tonight

You're not hopeless
You're not worthless
You are loved
Don't give up
This is your time"
