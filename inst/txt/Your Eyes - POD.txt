P.O.D.

You are my Heaven on earth, and how faithful is Jah,
To keep his promise to I and bless me with life divine.
You are whatever is good inside of I and I.
Let love clear the way cause the princess is coming.

Your Eyes, Your Eyes
and I can see Jah
Your Eyes, Your Eyes
This blessing in disguise
You got me hypnotized
and I can see forever
Your Eyes, Your Eyes

Your so Kind.
Give thanks unto Jah for he blesses and made you mine.
and you were touched by an angel, the kisses she left behind.
I know, I know, cause I can see it with my own eyes.
I know this is real but it feels like I'm dreaming.

Your Eyes, Your Eyes
and I can see Jah
Your Eyes, Your Eyes
This blessing in disguise
You got me hypnotized
and I can see forever
Your Eyes, Your Eyes

Your so Kind.
And this is my favorite place to be.
Cause you are so beautiful when I watch you sleep.
And in the moment I know, everything will be alright.
Cause you are the reason I breathe.
and when I need to find out who I am,
I can always get lost in...

Your Eyes, Your Eyes
and I can see Jah Jah
Your Eyes, Your Eyes
This blessing in disguise
You got me hypnotized
and I can see forever
Your Eyes, Your Eyes
and I can see Jah Jah
Your Eyes, Your Eyes
This blessing in disguise
Your Eyes, Your Eyes
and I can stay here forever
You got me hypnotized
and I can see forever
Your Eyes, Your Eyes

Your so Kind.
Your so Kind."
