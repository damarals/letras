"1" "Better Is One Day
Hillsong United

How lovely is Your dwelling place, oh Lord Almighty
Lord my soul longs and even faints for You
For here my heart is satisfy within Your presence
I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere (2X)
Than thousands elsewhere
One thing I ask and I would seek, to see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your glory dwells (2X)
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere (4X)
My heart and flesh cry out for You the living God
Your Spirit’s water to my soul
I’ve tasted and I’ve seen, come once again to me
I will draw near to You I will draw near to You... to You
Better is one day... Better is one day... Better is one day... Better is one day...
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere (4X)
Than thousands elsewhere"
