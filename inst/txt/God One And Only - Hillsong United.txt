Verse 1
In the world \"where's lost is seeking\"
Your the answer......... I know
I find a hope for all my life
I'm living as I sacrifice for You
In freedom and the truth

Pre-Chorus
And always I know You are here
and You're living in me
in my life You are the only one I need
in Jesus I believe

Chorus
You're the One who saved my soul
You gave me life
So I give it back to You
My God
The God One and only

Verse 2
Now I stand in Your salvation
I keep the faith when I fix my eyes in You
my hope is found in You Jesus
And always I know You are here
and You're living in me
in my life You are the only one I need
in Jesus I believe

Chorus

Bridge
You choose the cross and took my place
And I believe
This is love that I can't explain
Yes I believe

Chorus 2x"
