Third Day

In all the heavens there is one
who conquered death alone
and brought our freedom
your throne will last
throughout all time
let all the nations bow
and bring you praise

Victorious you reign victorious
over sin over death over all, over us

And with the angels we will sing
a blessed multitude of your creation
rejoicing with our holy king
the only one that brings us our salvation

Victorious you reign victorious
over sin over death over all, over us
Victorious you reign victorious
in your mighty name we trust
let all proclaim you reign victorious

Victorious we lift you up victorious

All nations rise and they will fall
the kingdom of our God will last forever
All nations rise and they will fall
the kingdom of our God will last forever

Victorious we lift you up victorious
Victorious we lift you up victorious

Victorious you reign victorious
over sin over death over all, over us"
