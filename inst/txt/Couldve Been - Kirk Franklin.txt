Without you love Lord tell me where would I be
Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah)
It could've been

Verse One: (Kirk Franklin)
Me in the cold with
(Everything gone)
No house no job
(Outside all alone)
Sitting trying to figure out
(Where I went wrong)
Can somebody help me
(Tell me what do I do)
Can't feed my kids need
(Money for the rent)
Bills after bills but
(Everything spent)
The enemy telling me you
(Might as well quit)
With tears in my eyes crying
(Lord please get me throught)
See that's the reason
(I just can't thank you enough no matter how hard I try Jesus I realize)

Vamp Two:
Too good to stop now father
I wanna give you thanks some more
All the things I've been through now
I see I'm better than I was before
When I think about all you've done
And how you've opened up every door
I can't help but say thank you
And if you wanna help me get up on the floor

(Vamp One)
