"1" "Am I Awake?
P.O.D.

Am I awake?
Or is this just a dream?
I'd like to say since you went away
Am I awake?
I'm wasting away
Don't wanna pray
I just can't take the pain

And I can't tell today from yesterday
And it's the same thing over and over again
And that's why I didn't plan on
I didn't plan on being here

Am I awake?
Or is this just a dream?
I'd like to say since you went away
Am I awake?
I'm wasting away
Don't wanna pray
I just can't take the pain

This place is just too crazy to be real
Or maybe it's not it could be... it could be real
Or maybe I've lost my mind if you don't mind
I'll just lay here for awhile

Am I awake?
Or is this just a dream?
I'd like to say since you went away
Am I awake?
I'm wasting away
Don't wanna pray
I just can't take the pain

Am I awake?
Or is this just a dream?
I'd like to say since you went away
Am I awake?
I'm wasting away
Don't wanna pray
I just can't take the pain"
