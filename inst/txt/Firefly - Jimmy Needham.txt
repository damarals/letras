"x"
"1" "Firefly
Jimmy Needham

It's tulips and it's daisies
Your favorite flowers lately
You think that I ain't listening, but you know I do
With your two lips on me baby
My head starts getting dazey
Don't give me a flower
What I want is you

It happened on the day you put your hand in mine
You went up to my head just like a glass of wine
Girl, you spark my attention like a firefly
And make me happy to be alive

You move into a room like
Summer breeze at noon time
Baby, out of nine, I'd give you ten
Your love is like an ocean
Surf and spray in motion
Baby, I'm a diver and I love to swim

It happened on the day you put your hand in mine
You went up to my head just like a glass of wine
Girl, you spark my attention like a firefly
And make me happy to be alive

These are just simple words of mine
And though most of what I feel is hard to rhyme
Ain't it good to know your boy gave it a try?
O a try
It'd take a thousand colors just to paint your eyes
Like saving grace, they raise me up to paradise
This ain't opinion, it's consensus from my heart and mind
You make me happy to be alive"
