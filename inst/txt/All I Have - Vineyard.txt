"1" "All I Have
Vineyard

What have I in this life
But the love in Your eyes
This empty world will one day fade
Only Your truth will remain

Jesus all I have is You
You’re the hope I’m holding to
I might weep but still my faith
Rests in You
As the heavens hold the skies
It’s Your hand that holds my life
And Your love will lead me on
When all else is gone

Jesus all I have is You
Jesus all I have is You
Jesus all I have is You
Jesus all I have is You"
