Switchfoot

Rain is a bad reminder of everything I don't wanna know
Rain is a backseat driver that takes me where I don't wanna go
And it looks like the sky is caving in again
I'm dry and cracked, the sky goes black
And tut, tut, it looks like rain

Erosion
Oh, Spirit fall like rain on my thirsty soul
Erosion
Oh, sweet erosion, break me and make me whole

The thirstiest grounds can't take the rain
My undecided vices washing on down the drain
And it looks like the sky is caving in again
My heart is cracked, the sky goes black
And tut, tut, it looks like rain

Oh, Erosion, would You wash away my sins
Oh, Erosion, I need a second start again
Oh, Erosion, would You break my heart again
Oh, Erosion, I am a broken hearted man
