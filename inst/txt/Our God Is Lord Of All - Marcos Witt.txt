"1" "Our God Is Lord Of All
Marcos Witt

We were created to worship our God
We were created to fall in love
And now we sing before the Great I am
Come on and lift your voice as loud as you can

(chorus)
Our God is Lord of all
Lord of all wonder
Lord of all beauty
Lord of eternity...Lord of all

Who could search out
The greatness of God
Yet we awe in the depth of His love
And now we're dancing for the Great I am
Come on and lift you voice as loud as you can"
