Oh my Lord, you are so kind
Oh my Lord, you are so kind
Morning to morning, day to day
You reveal your righteous ways
Oh my Lord, you are so kind
Oh my Lord, you are so kind

Morning to morning, day to day
You reveal your righteous ways

It's your kindness that leads to repentance
It's your blood that brings forgiveness
It's your mercy that leads me here
To your throne of grace

Oh my Lord, you are so kind
Oh my Lord, you are so kind
Morning to morning, day to day
You reveal your righteous ways
Oh my Lord, you are so kind
Oh my Lord, you are so kind

In your kindness I find repentance
In your blood I find forgiveness
In your mercy I find myself
At Your throne of grace, Your throne of grace"
