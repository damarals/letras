This world is not what it was meant to be
All this pain, all this suffering
There's a better place waiting
For me in heaven
Every tear will be wiped away
Every sorrow and sin erased
We'll dance on seas
Of amazing grace in heaven
In heaven, I'm going

Home where the streets are golden
Every chain is broken
Oh I wanna go, oh I wanna go
Home where every fear is gone
I'm in your open arms
Where I belong
Home
Turn around

Lay down my burdens, I lay down my past
I run to Jesus no turning back
Thank God almighty
I'll be free at last in heaven
In heaven, I'm going

Home where the streets are golden
Every chain is broken
Oh I wanna go, oh I wanna go
Home where every fear is gone
I'm in your open arms
Where I belong"
