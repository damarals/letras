"1" "Wait For The Sunshine
Take 6

I can still remember like it was yesterday
Summer vacation on the way
I was so excited i could hardly sleep
Next year i start the second grade

All night long i wondered what it could be like
Then my father said one thing
That made me feel all right

Wait for the sunshine
In the morning time
It’s another day that you were mine
Your love is like sunshine
After a stormy night
My sunshine

It wasn’t very pretty no
All those things we said
We used to be the best of friends (my mon ami)
And there are no excuses for the way we’ve been
Now its time to make amends

Before days turn into weeks turn into years
(before too long)
Tonight let’s take the time to understand the tears

Wait for the sunshine
In the morning time
It’s another day that you were mine
Your love is like sunshine
After a stormy night
My sunshine

Wait for the sunshine
In the morning time
It’s another day that you were mine
Your love is like sunshine
After a stormy night
My sunshine

You may be struggling trying to find a friend (o help me lord)
Wondering why you don’t fit in
(don’t get me wrong just get along)
And all the dreams you’re dreaming seem so far away
(just remember) greatness starts within

Even when the finish line is hard to see (keep on)
Don’t stop running because you just might be
Somebody’s sunshine...

Wait for the sunshine
In the morning time
It’s another day that you were mine
Your love is like sunshine
After a stormy night
My sunshine

Wait for the sunshine
In the morning time
It’s another day that you were mine
Your love is like sunshine
After a stormy night
My sunshine"
