Third Day

Blackbird, why you wearing that frown?
Don't you know Jesus loves you and me
and the preacher on T.V. you're putting down

Blackbird, how I love to hear your songs
I could spend all of my time in the shade
of the trees and listen all day long

But you're ever hearing, never understanding
Ever seeing, not perceiving and your heart
has grown callous
You're in a storm and lost you way
Won't you fly to heaven and be saved today

Blackbird, now you're broken your wing
You try to fly high but you know that you
can't go anywhere, you can't do anything

Blackbird, who put you in your cage
Tell me, was it God or was it you
Was it me? I guess it don't matter anyway

You say you need a remedy
for the thorn in your pride
I think it's such a tragedy
That you have left Him behind

You say you'd light you candle
But your love light doesn't shine
You say you talk to angels
Well I say it's such a lie"
