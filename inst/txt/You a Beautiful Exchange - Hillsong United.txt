"1" "You (a Beautiful Exchange)
Hillsong United

(Verse 1)
Invading all my weakness
You wrapped me up in grace
The worse of me succeeded
By the best of You

(Verse 2)
My heart is overtaken
My soul is overwhelmed
The worse of me succeeded
By the best of You

(Verse 3)
My dreams have found their purpose
My future in Your hands
This life would have no meaning
If it werenâ€™t for You

(PreChorus)
So I lay me down
For Kingdom come
Steal all that is within me
Cause all I want in this world
Is more of You

(Chorus)
And the less of me it is You
Increasing as I fade away
Your life for all the world to see

God It is You who breaks the chains
It is You who lights the way
And Everything I am cries out for You

(Verse 4)
Lord make me more transparent
Your life in mine displayed
And let every earthly glory
Go back to You"
