"1" "All I Need
Vineyard

All the beauty I can see
If it could belong to me
I would give it all for You

Any greatness I achieve
Every praise I may receive
I would give it all for You

All I need
You are all I need
I have found it true
Life comes only from You

All I need
You are all I need
Nothing else will do
No one else but You

If I'm given comfort here
Offered what the world holds dear
I would give it all for You"
