Father
I want to be close to You
You alone can understand me
Look inside my heart and find me

Father
I want to be close to You
You alone can satisfy me
ill the hole that is inside me

I cry with a passionate voice
I long to feel Your intimate touch
It's You I need so much
I'm empty without You
I am empty without You"
