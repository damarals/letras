"1" "He Gave Me A New Song
Amy Grant

He gave me a new song--
He really came down here Himself and sang it for me
In every key just for me.

He gave me a new light--
Now even when clouds hide the sunlight, life is still bright,
'Cause everything is all right.

He gave me a new song--
He really came down here Himself and sang it for me
In every key just for me.

He gave me a love song--
Yes it's the first real love song given to me,
And oh what a melody.
