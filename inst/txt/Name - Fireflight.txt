Fireflight

Seven days old in the ICU tonight
Little baby boy
They don’t want to have to say goodbye
Your mother’s on the phone, your father's in the hall
Praying, “God save his life”

He sees you, He’s near you
He knows your face
He knows your pain
He sees you, and He loves you
He knows your name
He knows your name

Four doors down
There’s a man who just won’t wake up
He crashed so hard
And the doctors want to pull the plug
Your wife is by your side, saying not tonight
Praying God will just show up

Maybe you're alone
In the corner of an empty house
Or maybe you're the one
No one notices in the crowd"
