"1" "Chasing Your Echo
Red

[Verse 1]
I'm captured again
Nothing now
Obeying this love escaping
Tasting yesterdays obsession
I'm feeling guilty of misery
Your love of violence

[Chorus]
It's over now
I don't know how to keep you here
But I can't let go

Don't run away
Just stay with me
Don't leave me
Chasing your echo

[Verse 2]
Desire breaks
My shadow wakes
It follows ever and after

[Chorus]
It's over now
I don't know how to keep you here
But I can't let go

Don't run away
Just stay with me
Don't leave me
Chasing your echo

[Bridge]
Obsession
Obsession

It's over now
I don't know how to keep you here
But I can't let goo

[Chorus]
It's over now
I don't know how to keep you here
But I can't let go

Don't run away
Just stay with me
Don't leave me
Chasing your echo"
