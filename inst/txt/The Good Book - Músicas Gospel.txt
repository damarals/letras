"1" "The Good Book
MÃºsicas Gospel

When I say it's you,
You will point at me.
So who is to blame,
That's the mystery.

Since Adam and Eve,
Blamed it on the snake.
Man's pointed fingers,
Who's word do you take.

Chorus:
The Good book says it clear,
But its words we don't hear.
It seems that we never learn,
Until it's our turn to burn.
God says that a lie is a sin,
And each one is saw by him.
The Good book says it clear,
We pay for what God hears.

When a lie has been told,
Its damage has been done.
Ohh will God understand,
When it comes your turn.

On your judgement day,
You'll see what you done.
Will you cry or fly away,
When his decision comes.

Chorus:
The Good book says it clear,
But its words we don't hear.
It seems that we never learn,
Until it's our turn to burn.
God says that a lie is a sin,
And each one is saw by him.
The Good book says it clear,
We pay for what God hears."
