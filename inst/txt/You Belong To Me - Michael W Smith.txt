"1" "You Belong To Me
Michael W. Smith

I knew you are the one
My heart was overcome
The day I looked into your eyes
The feeling so surreal
Like time was standing still
When you said you would be mine

Oh, you are a miracle
You're swetter than I've ever dreamed
You're so much more than beautiful
How can it be that you belong to me?

So walk whit me a while
And we will spend our lives
Learning the mysteries of love
And throught the darkest nights
We'll hold each other tight
I promise that will be enough

Oh, you are a miracle
You're swetter than I've ever dreamed
You're so much more than beautiful
How can it be that you belong to me

Oh girl, you are more than beautiful
How can this be, that you belong me
Oh, you belong to me
I love you, I love you, I love you
Girl, I love you
Oh, you are, you're more than beautiful
How can this be, that you belong me"
