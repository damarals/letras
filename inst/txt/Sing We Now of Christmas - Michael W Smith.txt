"1" "Sing We Now of Christmas
Michael W. Smith

Sing we now of Chritmas
Sing we all Noel
Of the Lord and Savior
We the tidings tell
Sing we Noel
For Christ our Lord is born
Sing we Noel
For Christ our Lord is born
Angels from on high
May shepherds come and see
He's born in Bethleham
A blessed family
Glory to God
For Christ our King is born
Glory to God
For christ our King is born
Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
Sing we all Noel
