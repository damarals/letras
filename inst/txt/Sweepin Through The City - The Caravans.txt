"1" "Sweepin' Through The City
The Caravans

Chorus
(Then we'll go) sweepin' through the city,
(where my) captain has gone before
(and we're gonna) sit down by the banks of the rivier;
I won't be back,
I won't be back,
I won't be back no more, no more.

Verse
Blessed are the pure in heart for they'll go,
(sweepin' through the city).
Blessed are the poor in spirit for they'll go,
(sweepin' through the city).
Blessed are they that mourn for they'll go,
(sweepin' through the city).
Blessed are the children of Israel for they'll go,
(sweepin' through the city).

Chorus

Vamp
In that city
