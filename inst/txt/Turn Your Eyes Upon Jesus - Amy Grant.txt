"1" "Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus
Amy Grant

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in his wonderful face
And the things of the earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of his glory and grace

O soul are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's a light for a look at the Savior
And life more abundant and free

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in his wonderful face
And the things of the earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of his glory and grace

His word shall not fail you, He promised
Believe Him, and all will be well
Then go to a world that is dying
His perfect Salvation to tell

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in his wonderful face
And the things of the earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of his glory and grace

O soul are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Savior
And life more abundant and free"
