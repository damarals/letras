"x"
"1" "Looking For You
Kirk Franklin

Verse 1

I’ve been down so long

I’ve been hurt for so long

There were times I thought I’d never see the break of day

It was hard for me to see Your plan for me

And I tried to believe struggling won’t last always



See night after night I prayed Lord

Don’t take Your joy from me

And then late one night

I read in Your love letter that it’s gonna get better



Don’t You know that I’ve been looking for You

I realize nothing else will satisfy [me]

I’m so glad I found You



Now that I’m changed

No one can keep me away from You



Verse 2

When my enemies tried to come for me

And they thought that my world was coming to an end

All the while You knew that I would make it through

I feel closer to You now than when I first began

Jesus You are, You are my sunlight after the rain

So wherever You are I just wanna be near You

I’m so glad I can hear You"
