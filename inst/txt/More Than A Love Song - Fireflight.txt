"1" "More Than A Love Song
Fireflight

Look into her eyes
you can see shes crying out
She hides behind her smile
you can see the pain of doubt
And if you would hold her close
you could feel the brokenness inside
You would know she feels alone
She feels empty

She needs more then a hug on a holiday
She needs more then a smile on a Sunday
Shes not looking for you to fix whats wrong
She really wants to know, really wants to know she belongs
She needs more than a love song

Listen to her now
Broken is a beautiful sound
Shes a little scared
Shes afraid of falling further down
But maybe if you let her know
And gave her just a little hope
Somehow if she knew the truth shed
come alive

In the end
we will learn
actions speak louder than our words"
