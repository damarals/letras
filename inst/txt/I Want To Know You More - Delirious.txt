"1" "I Want To Know You More
Delirious

In the secret
In the quiet place
In the stillness you are there
In the secret
In the quiet hour i wait
Only for you
'cuz i want to know you more

I want to know you
I want to hear your voice
I want to know you more
I wannt to touch you
I want to see your face
I want to know you more

I am reaching for the highest goal
That i might receive the prize
Pressing onward
Pushing every hindrance aside
Out of my way
'cuz i want to know you more

I want to know you
I want to hear your voice
I want to know you more
I want to touch you
I want to see your face
I want to know you more

I want to know you
I want to hear your voice
I want to know you more
I want to touch you
I want to see your face
I want to know you more

I want to know you
I want to hear your voice
I want to know you more
I want to touch you
I want to see your face
I want to know you more"
