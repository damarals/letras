Hillsong United

Behold the star of Bethlehem
The Word of God has become flesh
Unto us a child is born
The Savior of this broken world

Oh, hear the angel voices sing come let us adore Him
Peace has come for King is with us
Fully God and fully man
He comes for all with open hands
He rules with love on David's throne
All praise belongs to Christ alone

Holy, holy, holy
Jesus, we adore Thee
Peace has come for our King is with us

O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord"
