"1" "Fire and Fury
Skillet

Every brick and every stone of the world we made
Will come undone if I can't feel you here with me
In my sleep I call your name
But when I wake I need to touch your face
Cause I need to feel you here with me
You can stop the aching
Cause you're the one I need

I will burn, I will burn for you
With fire and fury. Fire and fury
My heart hurts, my heart hurts for you
You're love burns within me
With fire and fury

If I freeze you are the flame
You melt my heart, I washed in your rain
I know you'll always have the best of me
Destiny's got a hold of me
Guess I never knew love like love knows me
Because I need to feel you here with me

I will burn, I will burn for you
With fire and fury. Fire and fury
My heart hurts, my heart hurts for you
You're love burns within me
With fire and fury

Let it all fall down to dust
Can't break the two of us
We are the safe in the strength of love
You can stop the aching
Because you're the one I need

I will burn, I will burn for you
With fire and fury. Fire and fury
My heart hurts, my heart hurts for you
You're love burns within me
It burns, it burns, it burns, it burns

You're love burns within me
With fire and fury"
