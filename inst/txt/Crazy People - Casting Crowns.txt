Casting Crowns

Who builds a boat with no clouds in sight?
Who walks up to a giant and picks a fight?
Who turns a lion's den into a petting zoo?
Who can have a church in the firey furnace? I'll tell you

Crazy people trust in Jesus
Following Him wherever He leads us
Kingdom seekers, walk-by-faith believers
Here's the church, here's the steeple
Here's to all God's crazy people

Who brings a Bible into a public school?
Who shares a gospel even when the world calls them a fool? (Don't call me a fool)
And who's not afraid to go against the flow?
Well, cancel me and call me one of those
'Cause I'm one of those

Crazy people trust in Jesus
Following Him wherever He leads us
Kingdom seekers, walk-by-faith believers
Here's the church, here's the steeple
Here's to all God's crazy people
I'm one of those crazy people (I'm one of those crazy people)

Who sees the world as a mission field? (Crazy)
Who talks to Jesus like He's real? (Crazy)
Who believes the words in red? (Crazy)
Who says He's coming back again? (Crazy)

Crazy people trust in Jesus
Following Him wherever He leads us
Kingdom seekers, walk-by-faith believers
Here's the church, here's the steeple
Here's to all God's crazy people
His crazy people (Crazy people)
I'm one of those, I'm one of those crazy people"
