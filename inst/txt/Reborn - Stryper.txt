REBORN (LYRICS)

(Verse 1)
If you believe in My Love
If you believe in My Pain
If you believe in My Jealousy

If you believe in My Faith
If you believe in My Hope
If you believe in My Misery

If you believe in My Way
If you believe in My Word
If you believe in My Honesty

If you believe in My Life
If you believe in My Death
If you believe in My Memory

(Chorus)
I’ll crush the chains that bind
And make you feel you’re born again
(Reborn again, Reborn again)
Your freed heart, soul and mind
Will make you feel you’re born again

If you believe in My Grace
If you believe in My Peace
If you believe in my nobility

If you believe in My Power
If you believe in My Strength
If you believe in my Humility

(Repeat Chorus)"
