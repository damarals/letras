Vineyard

You are the Holy One, the Lord most high
You reign in majesty, You reign on high

We exalt Your Name,
High and Mighty One of Israel
We exalt Your Name,
Lead us on to war in the power of Your Name
We exalt Your Name,
The Name above all Names, our victorious King
We exalt Your Name

You are the worthy one, Lamb that was slain
You bought us with Your blood, And with You we'll reign

You are the king of kings, The Lord of Lords
All men will bow to You, Before Your throne"
