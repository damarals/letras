Hillsong United

Beholding your beauty is all that I long for
To worship You Jesus is my sole desire
For this very heart you have shaped for your pleasure
Purposed to lift Your Name high

Here in surrender, in pure adoration
I enter Your courts with an offering of praise
I am your servant come to bring You glory
As is fit for the work of Your hands

Now unto the Lamb who sits on the throne
Be glory and honour and praise
All of creation resounds with the song
Worship and praise Him
The Lord of lords

Spirit now living and dwelling within me
Keep my eyes fixed ever on Jesus' face
Let not the things of this world ever sway me
I'Ii run 'til I finish the race

Singing unto the Lamb who sits on the throne
Be glory and honour and praise
All of creation resounds with the song
Worship and praise the Lord
The Lord of lords

Now unto the Lamb who sits on the throne
Be glory and honour and praise
All of eternity echoes the song
Worship and praise Him
The Lord of lords

Holy, Lord, You are Holy
Jesus Christ is the Lord
Singing Holy, Lord, You are Holy
Jesus Christ is the Lord
Singing Holy, Lord, You are Holy
Jesus Christ is the Lord

Now unto the Lamb who sits on the throne
Be glory and honour and praise
Call all the wolrd to join in the song
Worship and praise Him
The Lord of lords

He's Lord of lords
Lord of lords
Lord of lords"
