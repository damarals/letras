"1" "No Reason To Hide
Hillsong United

(VERSE 1:)
We've got nothing to lose
We've got no reason to hide
We've got the answer inside of us
It's time we took the disguises off
We'll see Your glory revealed
And see Your Name lifted high
There is nobody else for us
Jesus You are the only One

(CHORUS:)
Woah
You're alive and we are free
You are everything
Everything we need woah!

(VERSE 2:)
There's not a minute to waste
Not a second to lose
There's a city that waits for us
It's time we took
All the lamp shades off
We'll see Your glory revealed
And see Your Name lifted high
There is nobody else for us
Jesus You are the only One

(CHORUS 2:)
Woah
Love has spoken and we believe
You are everything
Everything we need
Woah!

Wo - oah
Wo - oah
Wo - oah

(BRIDGE:)
Nothing compares to You
Nothing could ever separate us now
Your love is ours
Nothing compares to You
Nothing could ever separate us
From this love

Nothing can separate us
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can separate us now"
