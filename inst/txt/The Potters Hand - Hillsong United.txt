Hillsong United

Beautiful Lord, wonderful Saviour
I know for sure all of my days are held in Your hand.
Crafted into Your perfect plan.

You gently call me into Your presence
Guiding me by Your Holy Spirit, teach me dear Lord.
To live all of my life through your eyes.
I'm captured by Your holy calling
Set me apart, I know You're drawing me to Yourself
Lead me Lord, I pray.

CHORUS:
Take me, mold me, use me, fill me,
I give my life to the Potter's hand.
Call me, guide me, lead me, walk beside me
I give my life, to the Potter's hand.

Ooo Ooo
Ooo"
