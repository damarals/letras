"1" "How He Loves
Jesus Culture

He is jealous for me
Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy
When all of a sudden,
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
And I realize just how beautiful you are
And how great your affections are for me.
Oh, how he loves us so
Oh, how he loves us
How he loves us so.

Yeah, he loves us
Woah, how he loves us
Woah, how he loves us
Woah, how he loves.

So we are his portion and he is our prize,
Drawn to redemption by the grace in his eyes
If grace is an ocean we're all sinking
So heaven meets earth
Like a sloppy wet kiss a
Nd my heart turns violently inside of my chest
I don't have time to maintain these regrets
When I think about the way

That he loves us,
Woah, how he loves us
Woah, how he loves us
Woah, how he loves

He loves us,
Woah, how he loves us
Woah, how he loves us
Woah, how he loves

Cause he loves us,
Woah, how he loves us
Woah, how he loves us
Woah, how he loves

Yeah, he loves us
Woah, how he loves us
Woah, how he loves us
Woah, how he loves"
