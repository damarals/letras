"1" "Use Your Strength For Jehovah's Name
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

When you were younger, life seemed so simple
You did your best to do what's right
Giving answers and preaching the good news
You would pray each and ev'ry night

But as you got older, with this world trying to mold you
Suddenly it was not so easy to be knocking on those doors
But as you get taller, smarter, trying to work harder
Never let go of Jehovah
The best is still in store

You have a treasured place in Jehovah's house
He'll help you out
And you have so much to offer, so much to do
Jehovah sees your faith
Know he treasures you

Now you are older and dealing with changes
Like all the trials have just begun
Growing anxious from all of your fears
Talk to God, he always listens

And as you get wiser, find the ways you can apply
The truth in your life and feel the joy of sacrifice
And as you get taller, smarter, trying to work harder
Never let go of Jehovah
The best is still in store

You have a treasured place in Jehovah's house
He'll help you out
And you have so much to offer, so much to do
Jehovah sees your faith
Know he treasures you

So use your strength for Jehovah's name
You won't regret it, just ask the ones who did it

You have a treasured place in Jehovah's house
He'll help you out
And you have so much to offer, so much to do
Jehovah sees your faith
Know he treasures you

So use your strength for Jehovah's name
You won't regret it, just ask the ones who did it
So use your strength for Jehovah's name
You won't regret it, just ask the ones who did it"
