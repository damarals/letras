"1" "If There Were No God
Youthful Praise

If there were no God there would be no music
There would be no dream to be dreaming of
What a dreadful thought of an empty future
If there were no God there would be no love
If there were no God there would be no children
There would be no joy to relieve our tears
Not a tender hand to provide us comfort
No consoling heart to subdue our fears
Chorus:
But we know that God is with us
And we know His majesty
Reigning now, the King eternal
Yes we know the victory
If there were no God there would be no sunshine
There would be no rain to refresh the earth
There would be no jewels to display their value
There would be no thought of enduring words
If there were no God there'd be no creation
There would be no light there would be no breath
No surpassing joy nothing in existence
If there were no God all would be death
Repeat Chorus (x2)
Yes we know, yes we know the victory
Yes we know the victory"
