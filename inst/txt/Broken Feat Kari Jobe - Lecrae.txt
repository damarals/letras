"1" "Broken (Feat. Kari Jobe)
Lecrae

I'm just a broken instrument in the hands of the Greatest
So if the notes are off it's 'cause I ain't nuthin' to play with
And you can fault me, but ain't we all off key?
Majoring in the minors like there ain't no errors behind us
Somehow He still makes these melodies with my felonies
I ain't buyin' nothin' they sellin' me what you tellin' me
Broken pieces actin' like we ain't cracked
Man we all messed up and cain't no one escape that
We some broken people
Came from broken homes
Broken hearts inside of a broken soul
Alcoholics to addicts
English, African, Arabs
Ain't no riches to fix it
You still broke when you have it
If you ain't breakin' bad and you still chasin' the habit
It ain't no wonderland so we still chasing the rabbit
Ain't a soul on the planet
That's better than another
And we all need grace in the face of each other

All the pieces on the ground
I shattered all the dreams I thought I found
Can You put me back together?
I need Your grace for my flaws
God I'm broken in this mess I've made
I need You to restore me

From Heaven we all small
Can't nobody buy tickets
You better have will call
That reaper he will call
They hurt just like me
Work just like me
Lust of the flesh the pride of life they flirt with like me
Regardless of our money we all broke together
And if we don't swallow our pride we gon choke together
Tryna hold onto our lives with these clumsy hands
Fell off the wall of purity
Doing that Humpty dance
Forget the king's horses
Forget the king's men
The King is coming to put us back together again
Been fighting since my daddy left
Fighting for approval
Think I don't know tryna get this world to love me is futile
We Tyler Durden won't be the burden of being less
Than what we were made to be like being what they suggest
We are outsiders, outliers
Out cry is loud, the meek inherit the earth
And God opposes the proud

All the pieces on the ground
I shattered all the dreams I thought I found
Can You put me back together?
I need Your grace for my flaws
God I'm broken in this mess I've made
I need You to restore me

Your presence in me
Is all the strength that I need
Your presence in me
Is all the strength that I need
And I'll always be home
And I'll always be home

All the pieces on the ground
I shattered all the dreams I thought I found
Can You put me back together?
I need Your grace for my flaws
God I'm broken in this mess I've made
I need You to restore me

You never left me
You never ran off
You never gave up"
