Switchfoot

The flowers cut and brought inside
Black cars in a single line
Your family in suits and ties
And you're free

The ache I feel inside
Is where the life has left your eyes
I'm alone for our last goodbye
But you're free

I remember you like yesterday
Yesterday
I still can't believe you're gone
Oh I remember you like yesterday
Yesterday
And until I'm with you, I carry on

Adrift on your ocean floor
I feel weightless numb and sore
A part of you and me is torn
You're free

I woke from a dream last night
I dreamt that you were by my side
Reminding me I still had life
In me

I remember you like yesterday
Yesterday
I still can't believe you're gone
Oh I remember you like yesterday
Yesterday
And until I'm with you, I carry on

I'll carry on, I'll carry on

Every lament is a love song
Yesterday, yesterday
I still can't believe you're gone

Every lament is a love song
Yesterday, yesterday"
