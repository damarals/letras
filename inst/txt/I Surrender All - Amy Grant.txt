"1" "I Surrender All
Amy Grant

All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust him
In his presence daily live

I surrender all, I surrender all
All to Thee my blessed Savior
I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender
At thy feet I humble bow
Worldly pleasures all forsaken
Take me, Jesus, Take me now

I surrender all, I surrender all
All to Thee my blessed Savior
I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender
Lord, I give myself to thee
Fill me with thy love and power
Let thy blessing fall on me

I surrender all, I surrender all
All to Thee my blessed Savior
I surrender all"
