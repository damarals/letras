MercyMe

(Verse)
May our hearts sing louder than our voices Jesus 2x's
For the only one worthy is the one who freed us 2x's
May our hearts sing louder than our voices Jesus
And let it be pleasing to you oh lord (repeat)
(Chorus)
We dance
And we praise
And we lift our hearts and say
Holy, holy, holy is the lord our God (repeat)
