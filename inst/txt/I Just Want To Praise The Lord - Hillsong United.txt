"1" "I Just Want To Praise The Lord
Hillsong United

I just want to praise the Lord
I just want to dance and celebrate yeah
I just want to bless my God
Lift my hands and sing (repeat)

Chorus:
Heavens and the earth proclaim
All the nations bow before You
All creation shouts Your praise
The majesty, honour and glory of God"
