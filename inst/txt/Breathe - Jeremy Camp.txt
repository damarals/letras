"1" "Breathe
Jeremy Camp

You fill my empty soul
I'd give you all control
You take this heart o fmine
And make the pieces whole
You broke this fear inside
I'll leave these cares behind
You take this simple mold
And sanctify my mind
You formed me before I was known
I was made your own now

Refrão:
Breathe in me
Breathe the breath of life
It's more than I can see
Breathe in me
Breathe the breath of life
It's more than I can see

You took on everything to make me feel complete
You answered every call
You're never far from reach
You lift me when I fail
You break down every wall
You feel my every need, I dedicate my all
You took this failed attempt to stand
And you carry me now

(Refrão)

I won't hesitate to call
When I'm empty from within
And I know the source of life
Are the very words you give
You formed before I was known
And I was made your own now

(Refrão)"
