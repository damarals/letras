"1" "I Am Yours
Jimmy Needham

When my heart was embittered
And pierced within,
When I found myself senseless
And ignorant,
You had taken hold of my right hand
And made me continually yours.
I am continually yours.

I am yours, I am yours,
Like the sparrow in your hand,
Like the lilies of the land,
I am yours.
I am yours, I am yours,
No one else do I desire,
You have set my heart on fire,
I am yours.

And I am continually yours,
Yes, I am continually yours.

My flesh, my heart may fail within,
Riddled with scars of former sin.
Nevertheless I will rise again,
For I am continually yours,
Yes, I am continually yours.

I am yours, I am yours,
Like the sparrow in your hand,
Like the lilies of the land,
I am yours.
I am yours, I am yours,
No one else do I desire,
You have set my heart on fire,

I am yours.

My crime and guilt, my dark and shame
My finger pointing 'I'm to blame'
Are covered by your crimson stains
And I am continually yours,
Yes, I am continually yours,
I am continually yours."
