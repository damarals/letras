Vineyard

All over the world, all over the world
Your Spirit is moving all over the world
Your river is flowing,
Your presence has come
Your Spirit is moving all over the world

You're touching the nations
You're bringing your love
Your Spirit is moving all over the world

All over the world, all over the world
Your Spirit is moving all over the world
Your banner is lifted,
Your praises are sung
Your Spirit is moving all over the world

Divisions are falling
You're making us one
Your Spirit is moving all over the world"
