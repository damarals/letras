Hillsong United

Saved by your mercy, found in your grace
Totally surrendered to your embrace
And there's nothing more than you.
See your perfection, I'm lost in your peace
Your faithfulness sings over me
And your love is the light of my soul.
And I lift my eyes to you, creator of the world.

And I stand in awe of you, of your glory
And I live to worship you, son of God
King of heaven.

And the angels round your throne cry out Holy
To the One who is to come
Hear us sing Hallelujah."
