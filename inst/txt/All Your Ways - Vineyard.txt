"1" "All Your Ways
Vineyard

I can hear the sound of many waters
Ten thousand voices joined
To praise Your name
I can hear the thundering of the oceans
As deep calls to deep to proclaim

All Your ways are holy
All Your ways are high
Honor, praise, and glory
Are Yours forevermore

I can see the hills and the mountains
Break forth into songs of joyful praise
I can see the trees as they are dancing
And all creation joins in to proclaim

All Your ways are holy
All Your ways are high
Honor, praise, and glory,
Blessing, power and might
They are Yours forevermore
They are Yours forevermore
They are Yours forevermore"
