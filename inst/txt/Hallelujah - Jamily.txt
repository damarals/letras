"1" "Hallelujah
Jamily

I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music do you?
It goes like this - the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled King composing Hallelujah.

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah.

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.

Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah."
