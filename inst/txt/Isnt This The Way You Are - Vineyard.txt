"1" "Isn't This The Way You Are
Vineyard

I will never know
The limits of Your love
You hem me in before and behind
The heavens are Your home
The deep is Your design
And from Your presence I can never hide
And from Your presence I can never hide

Isn t this the way You are
Your love is always a mystery
The way You are with me

Who can hold a measure to Your love
Who can hold a measure to Your measure to
Your measure to Your love"
