"1" "I Would do Anything
Vineyard

King of righteousness
Who is like you
Lord of heaven and earth
There is none who can compare
Pearl of greatest prince
Who is like you
Precious sacrifice
There is none who can compare

Your unfailing grace still amazes me
Set this sinner free
And make my heart to sing

I would do anything
I would do anything
To spend eternity with you
If I could have just one thing
If I could have just one thing
I would choose you
I would choose you"
