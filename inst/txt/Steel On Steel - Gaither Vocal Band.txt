"1" "Steel On Steel
Gaither Vocal Band

No one said that this was a picnic
Bumping with you is like hitting a wall.
You knocked off some of my rough edges
So I'm going to hang for the long, long haul.

I really need what you bring to the party
The differences here ain't no big deal.
'Cause all this rub just makes us better
We sharpen each other like steel on steel.

Well, we're not known for holding back opinions
I've got my knack for invading your space.
I ain't afraid of cleaning your carpet
And I ain't afraid of getting in your face.

I really need what you bring to the party
The differences here ain't no big deal.
'Cause all this rub just makes us better
We sharpen each other like steel on steel.

Yeah, we sharpen each other like steel on steel.

When the smoke clears, I know you're a brother
Follow this through to the bitter end.
We stick around, we might learn something
Something about how to be a good friend.

I really need what you bring to the party
The differences here ain't no big deal.
'Cause all this rub just makes us better
We sharpen each other like steel on steel.

I really need what you bring to the party
The differences here ain't no big deal.
'Cause all this rub just makes us better
We sharpen each other like steel on steel.

Yeah, we sharpen each other like steel on steel.
We sharpen each other like steel on steel.
Yeah, we sharpen each other like steel on steel.
We sharpen each other like steel on steel."
