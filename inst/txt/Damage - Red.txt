(Hear me)
Now the damage is done
I can't escape, can't run
Can't undo what I've done
(I am waiting)
Do you hear me now
Will you answer me?
Are you even there?
(Don't look away)

All I do is damage, damage
It's destroying me
All I do is damage, damage
I'm sick of the misery

(Hear me)
I am human debris
I am crashed and bent
I'm a catastrophe
(I am waiting)
I'm human debris
I am crashed and bent
I'm a catastrophe

All I do is damage, damage
It's destroying me
All I do is damage, damage
I'm sick of the misery
Take this away
It was just a mistake
Save me
All I do is damage

I am covered in shame
There is no one to blame
I am covered in shame
I have is no one to blame
I am covered in shame
I have no one to blame
Shame! I am covered, I am covered
Shame! I am covered

Take this away
It was just a mistake
Save me (I'm a catastrophe)

All I do is damage, damage
It's destroying me
All I do is damage, damage
I'm sick of the misery"
