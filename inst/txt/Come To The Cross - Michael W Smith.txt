"1" "Come To The Cross
Michael W. Smith

Mourner, wherever you are
Wherever you are at the cross there is room
Tell your burdened heart
Your burdened heart at the cross there is room

Tell it in the saviour's ear
Cast away your every fear
Only speak and He will hear

Hallelujah, Everyone
Everyone can come to the cross
It doesn't matter what you've done
Everyone can come to the cross

Senior,come today
Come today, at the cross there is room
Blesses thought for everyone
For everything can come to the cross

Now a living fountain, see
Open there for you and me
For rich and poor, for bond and free

Hallelujah, Everyone
Everyone can come to the cross
It doesn't matter what you've done
Everyone can come to the cross"
