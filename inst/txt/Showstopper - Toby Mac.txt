Toby Mac

Yeah, this is the day we came to get down
We came to claim the game in your town
You came to ride the highs of this junk
Baby, we came to guarantee the big krunk
So if you or your people ever wanna doubt this
Show stopping, body rockin’ tell ‘em all about this
Crew from the village of the diverse citizens
One stop, one shot livin’ like a kid again
So turn up the lights, they’ve been waiting all night for the
The show stopper
The jaw dropper
The big poppa
We gonna’ get it (what, what)
We gonna’ get it good
Hope just broke right through the door
So why you gotta ask what I came here for
Man, we ‘bout to light the night with that flare
Shot from the gun in the hand OF DESPAIR
With a kick so hard that you gotta be strong
It’s so hot, you can barely hold on
So rock me, drop me, but you will never stop me
From taking this show to a full on monopoly
So turn off the lights, pass me the mic
Bring on the lights, they’ve been waiting all night for the
It’s automatic
Don’t want no static
I’m a fanatic, Jesus fanatic
It’s automatic, don’t want no static
He’s a fanatic, Jesus fanatic
Don’t want no static
It’s automatic
