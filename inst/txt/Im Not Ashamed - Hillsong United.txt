"1" "I'm Not Ashamed
Hillsong United

When you found me.
My whole world changed.
I'm redeemed by your life.

Let the earth see,
You are freedom.
Turned my darkness to light.

You welcomed me in
with open arms.
Into unending life.

I'm not ashamed of the gospel Lord.
Your power, your love, that saved my soul
Now iÂ´m alive in you
I live in the risen son."
