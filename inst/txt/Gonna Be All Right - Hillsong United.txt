"1" "Gonna Be All Right
Hillsong United

I've found my meaning in You
Your cause is the reason why I live
Your grace is teaching me how to give

I give my whole life to You
Your love is the reason why I sing
Jesus, You are my everything

Every night, every day
I don't need to worry, no I celebrate
All the things You've done in me

And It's gonna be alright
Cause You are in my life
And It's gonna be alright
Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be alright
And It's gonna be alright
Cause, Jesus You're my light
And You've shown me a way
All of my troubles, all my life, I give To you my king"
