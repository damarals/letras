You were the only one to see
Secrets locked inside of me
You were the only oneso tell me where you've gone
I've lost a little more today
Nothing more you can take away
Can I believe you still?
I need something real

No one ever wants to feel like this
No one ever wants to feel like this

Where are you? I can't find you
Broke in two, left behind you
Reach for me (Reach for me)
I'm falling deep (I'm falling)
Promise me you're never leaving
I'm still here, broken, bleeding
Reach for me (Reach for me)
I'm falling deep
Reach for me

No one could ever get me more
Nothing could ever fix me more
Did I scare you away?
Don't say I'll be okay

No one ever wants to feel like this

Where are you? I can't find you
Broke in two, left behind you
Reach for me (Reach for me)
I'm falling deep (I'm falling)
Promise me you're never leaving
I'm still here, broken, bleeding
Reach for me (Reach for me)
I'm falling deep
Reach for me

No one ever wants to feel like this
No one ever wants to feel like this
No one ever wants to hurt like this
No one ever wants to hurt like this

Where are you? I can't find you
Broke in two, left behind you
Reach for me (Reach for me)
I'm falling deep (I'm falling)
Promise me you're never leaving
I'm still here, broken, bleeding
Reach for me (Reach for me)
I'm falling deep
Reach for me

Nobody wants to feel like this
Reach for me
Nobody wants to hurt like this
I'm falling deep
Reach for me"
