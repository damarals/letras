"1" "I'll Wait For You
Michael W. Smith

Give me one more week and I'll be gone
It's been a long hard month of Sundays
And still no rain
Nothin' left around here but the dust and shame
I know you know
I know you know
And I'm tryin' to find a way to hold to my faith

(CHORUS)
While I wait for you
I wait for you

Now I lie awake at night tryin' not to think
But these are the hardest times I've ever seen
I'm still holdin'on
I know you never said it'd be easy all thick and no thin
But the man who waits it's the man who wins
Holdin'on, oh yeah, I'm holdin'on
Gonna hide myself away, hide myself away

(CHORUS)
And I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you

(BRIDGE)
I need you now
I need you now
I need you now
You know I need you now

(CHORUS)
And I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
I'll gonna wait for you
I'll wait for you

I'm gonna walk on
And not get weary now
I'm gonna run and not fall down
I know that someday
I'll get my wings somehow
And you will carry me
You will carry me
I'm gonna rise up
Like an eagle now
Gonna ride that big blue sky
And should I someday
Fall back down again
You will carry me
You will carry me even now
Carry me even now
You're gonna carry me
You will carry
You will carry me even now
Oh, carry me, oh yeah"
