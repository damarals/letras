"1" "Confession (what's Inside My Head)
Red

I feel fine
And I can’t smile
But I feel the anger coming
Its underneath
I don’t know why
It’s always overflowing
It’s a constant fight
Deep inside
And I wanna forget it

I confess I’m always afraid always ashamed
Of what’s inside me
I confess I’m always afraid always ashamed
Of what’s inside my head

And I can’t breath
And I still feel
But not the way I want to
I’m on the edge I don’t’ know how
I can escape this nightmare

I confess I’m always afraid always ashamed
Of what’s inside me
I confess I’m always afraid, always ashamed
Of what’s inside my head
What’s inside my head

Wasting away is part of my instinct
I’ll runaway, everything I hate
Take this away, help me escape
Take this away
I confess,
Innocence
Innocence
Innocence
