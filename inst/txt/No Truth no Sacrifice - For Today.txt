"1" "No Truth no Sacrifice
For Today

The weak, justify the actions of the weak
There is no answer, in cancer you speak
Sickness in the selfishness
A wolf in disguise hidding a bitter fire
Too afraid to look into his lifeless eyes
Lost inside a world built upon deception
The coward in the mirror is his own reflection
No truth, No sacrifice
This world has grown content with compromise
Helplessness is just an illusion
There's a hole in our hearts that overflows, and stains the earth with sin
There's a hole in our hearts
That will not close, unless we face the lies within
Helplessness is just an illusion
The adversary that threatens to kill us all
Paralyzed by our own confusion
Our selfishness will be our downfall

No truth, no sacrifice
The world has grown content with compromise
Know truth. Know sacrifice
The world has grown content with compromise
There's a hole in our hearts
that overflows, and stains the earth with sin
There's a hole in our hearts
That will not close, unless we face the lies within"
