"1" "Touch Your Heart
Cristina Mel

I need to reach
And touch your heart
Almighty God
I'm all alone
This world so wrong
Has let me down
I want a friend
To hold my hand
Where else can i turn
You're the way,the trut an life
The love of my life

You're my Lord
You're my love
Come and hold me in your arms
And make me see
You fight for me
You're my Lord
You're my love
I'm a sheep and you're my sheperd
Make me feel
Your love for me
Your love for me
