"1" "Still That Girl
Britt Nicole

Dreams they come
Plans they change
Yeah, we're gonna break
Yeah, we're gonna break
Things we face make us who we are
Baby, you're a star, shining in the dark
Let's go back to the summer
The summer when we dreamed and loved
Let's go back again
Let's go back again
Yeah, back again, my friend
To the summer when...

I'm holding a picture from seven years back
I smile at the memory, you're smiling right back at me
And I see brown hair and bright eyes, such a beautiful blue
A heart full of laughter with nothing to lose
That's how I remember you

You were young, you were free
And you dared to believe you could be the girl
Who could change the world
Then your life took a turn
And you fell and it hurt
But you're still that girl
And you're gonna change this world
Whoah, oh, oh, oh, you're still that girl
You're still that girl
Whoah, oh, oh, oh, you're still that girl
You're still that girl

Sometimes life don't go the way you planned
And we all have days when we just don't understand
Searching for meaning, it's not always easy
But your story is not over, it's still being told
Your sunrise is coming brighter than gold
Let's go back again to the summer when...

What if the picture is bigger than you see
And God has you right where He wants you to be
Just listen to your heart
He's telling you with every beat
You're still that girl

You were young, you were free
And you dared to believe you could be the girl
Who could change the world
Don't you know, don't you see?
All you need is to believe
That you're still that girl
And you're gonna change this world
Whoah, oh, oh, oh, you're still that girl
You're still that girl
Whoah, oh, oh, oh, you're still that girl
You're still that girl

I see it in your eyes
I see it in your smile
You're still that girl
You're still that girl"
