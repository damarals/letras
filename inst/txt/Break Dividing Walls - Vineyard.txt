"1" "Break Dividing Walls
Vineyard

There is a place of commanded blessing
Where brethren in unity dwell
A place where anointing oil is flowing
Where we live as one

You have called us to be a body
You have called us as friends
Joined together in the bond of the Spirit
unto the end

Father we join with the prayer of Jesus
As You are, so let us be one
Joined together in unity and purpose
All for the love of Your Son

We will break dividing walls
We will break dividing walls
We will break dividing walls
In the name of Your Son
We will break dividing walls
We will break dividing walls
We will be one"
