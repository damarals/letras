Vineyard

Well I'm thirsty Lord, Yes I'm thirsty Lord
Well I'm thirsty Lord
For the living waters of life

And I want a drink, Yes I want a drink
Of the living waters of life

Fill me up Lord, don't have to feel it
Lord make me drunk with the Holy Spirit

And I'll take drink, Well I'll take a drink
Of the living waters of life

Chorus:
Fill me up Lord, don't have to feel it
Lord make me drunk with your Holy Spirit
I'm tired of whispering I'll start to shoutin'
Don't want a cup Lord Give me a fountain

I'll take another drink I'll take another drink
Of the living waters of life"
