"x"
"1" "All In (letting Go)
Toby Mac

Why’s it always circumstantial?
Never any real potential
Obvious and so sequential
It always ends the same
Holding out with all that’s in me
Is it worth all this pretending?
A story with an ugly ending it’s never worth the pain

So right here and now I am all in

‘Cause I’m letting go of everything I am
And I’m holding on to everything You are
I’m letting go of everything I once was
I’m all in
I’m fallin’ into Your arms again

Can we just wait out the weather?
I could stay right here forever
Got to get myself together
Real life is on the way
Call it my foregone conclusion
I’ll always welcome Your intrusion
You’re the master of my choosing
I’m all Yours

This time I’m so for real
It’s time I sealed the deal
Shut down my lame appeals
I’m letting go
I’m letting go
I’ll throw caution to the sky
Kiss all my fears goodbye
This time its do or die
I’m letting go …"
