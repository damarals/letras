Hillsong United

I will dance I will sing
To be mad for my King
Nothing Lord is hindering this passion in my soul
I will dance I will sing
To be mad for my king
Nothing Lord is hindering this passing in my soul

CHORUS:
And I'll become even more undignified than this
Some my say it's foolishness
But I'll become even more undignified than this
Leave my pride by my side
And I'll become even more undignified than this
Some my say it's foolishness
But I'll become even more undignified than this

Than this

LA LA LA LA LA, HEY
LA LA LA LA LA

LA LA LA LA LA, HEY
LA LA LA LA LA

It's all for you my Lord"
