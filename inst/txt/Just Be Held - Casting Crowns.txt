"1" "Just Be Held
Casting Crowns

Hold it all together
Everybody needs you strong
But life hits you out of nowhere
And barely leaves you holding on

And when youre tired of fighting
Chained by your control
Theres freedom in surrender
Lay it down and let it go

So when you're on your knees
And answers seem so far away
You're not alone, stop holding on
And just be held
Your world's not falling apart
It's falling into place
I'm on the throne, stop holding on
And just be held
Just be held, just be held

If your eyes are on the storm
You'll wonder if I love you still
But if your eyes are on the cross
You'll know I always have and I always will

And not a tear is wasted
In time, you'll understand
I'm painting beauty with the ashes
Your life is in my hands

Lift your hands, lift your eyes
In the storm is where you'll find me
And where you are, I'll hold your heart
I'll hold your heart
Come to me, find your rest
In the arms of the God who won't let go"
