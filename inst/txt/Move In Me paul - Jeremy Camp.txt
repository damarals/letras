"1" "Move In Me (paul)
Jeremy Camp

The man I buried had a heart of stone
Left him in there in the bright light out on a dirt road
The day You saved me, from shadow and shame
Old things gone, got a new song, got a new name
Burnin' like a wildfire, kickin 'up flames
A brand new man in a wasteland singing about grace
Gonna jump the fences, until the world is free
But I won’t make a move until You move in me.

I’m knocking on doors, You’re keeping the keys
Maybe they’ll open, maybe they’re not for me
I’m setting the sails, You ready the seas
But I won’t make a move until You move in me.

Gonna sing a little louder, gonna rattle these chains
Locked up tight round midnight won't stay that way
Gonna bless this dirt floor, gonna kiss these walls
Singing Your praise until the earth shakes and watching them fall

I’m knocking on doors, You’re keeping the keys
Maybe they’ll open, maybe they’re not for me
I’m setting the sails, You ready the seas"
