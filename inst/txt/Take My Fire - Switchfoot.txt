"1" "Take My Fire
Switchfoot

Everyday enemy try to get the best of me
The enemy under my skin
Everyday Enemy
My fatal flaw anatomy feeling like I just can't win
Sometimes I wish I didn't feel that much
Sometimes I wish I didn't need that touch
Everyday my enemy pretend to be a friend to me
No matter what state I'm in

But you're never going to take my fire
I cannot not be tamed
No you never going to take my fire
It's burning in my veins
You say the world is changing
But I still burn the same
No you never going to take my fire, take my fire
Let me burn now

The safety that you're selling me
One day be the death of me
Face like I just saw ghosts
Images on the box again
Taking up all the oxygen
Tell me how we sunk this low
Ain't it coming ain't the end in sight
To steal it back like a thief in the night
There's my own sworn enemy
Faking and pretend to be
A wolf in a sheepskin coat

But you're never going to take my fire
In spite of all your rain
No you never going to take my fire, take my fire

I'm a fighter
A soul all nighter
I'm gonna recognize the truth
Gonna recognize a liar
You're never gonna take my fire
True beginner
A loser and a winner
Part saint part sinner
And all of me desire
You're never gonna take my fire
I'm a giver
A one arrow quiver
I've been sending my regrets
Down the river of fire

You're never gonna take my
My fire
A loose, live wire
I'm a one-shot rocket aiming higher and higher
And higher
Cause you're never gonna take my fire
Ancient flame lit the spark back before I was young
When I'm speaking with the fire it's my native tongue
No you never going to take my fire, take my fire
Let me burn now"
