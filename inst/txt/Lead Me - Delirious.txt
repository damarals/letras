Lead Me

We have flooded the altar with our tears
We have wearied you Lord with our words
Great God, our promises we've broken
Oh Lord, forgive me.

You are breaking the pride in our hearts
You have given us tears for the lost
You crown the humble with salvation
Oh Lord, humble me.

Lead me Oh lead me into your arms
I will be safe in the shadow of your wing
Lead me Oh lead me into your arms
I will be safe in Almighty.

You have paid back our sin with your love
Lovers arms you have offered to us
Faithful one raise up a faithful people
Who find their treasure here."
