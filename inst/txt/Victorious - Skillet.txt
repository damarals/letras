I hear them talk to me
But they're not listening
Their words are kerosene
They don't know who I am
They'd never understand
What it's like to be me

I don't wanna be here
So stuck inside
Tell me how long have I been here
I'm losing track of time

In all this loneliness
In all this emptiness
Been stuck inside this room like a prison sentence
I'm not gonna stay
Tell me there's a way

High above it all (High above)
Victorious victorious
Far too long I've crawled (Far too long)
In hopelessness I'm over this
Don't give up on me (Don't give up on me)
Tell me you believe (Tell me you believe)
I can face it all (Face it all)
Victorious victorious

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Can't change this overnight
Though heaven knows I've tried
Here I go again
I need a savior now
Someone to break me out
Who's been the place I've been

Don't wanna be forgotten
When I'm dead and gone
I just want to be the one who
Got up and came back strong

High above it all (High above)
Victorious victorious
Far too long I've crawled (Far too long)
In hopelessness I'm over this
Don't give up on me (Don't give up on me)
Tell me you believe (Tell me you believe)
I can face it all (Face it all)
Victorious victorious

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Help me
Cause I'm falling
When I can't sleep, but I'm holding on
Can't face this night alone

In all this loneliness
In all this emptiness
Been stuck inside thisroom like a prison sentence
I'm not gonna stay
Tell me there's a way

High above it all (High above)
Victorious victorious
Far too long I've crawled (Far too long)
In hopelessness I'm over this
Don't give up on me (Don't give up on me)
Tell me you believe (Tell me you believe)
I can face it all (Face it all)
Victorious victorious

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh"
