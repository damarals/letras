"1" "Look Like Love
Britt Nicole

Have you ever felt - Oh!
Have you ever felt like that
Like you just, just rushin' through life
Like you don't have time for your friends or the world outside
Well, I've been there

We gotta slow it down
Take a look around
When we gonna stop?
When we gonna stop runnin', runnin'?

It's keeping you and me
From who we need to be

I wanna look like love
Be more than just enough
For the hearts that are broken, coming undone
It's up to you and me
To leave a legacy
If we're all they ever see
I wanna look like, look live love
I wanna look like, look live love

Let me be the first to admit
There are days that I just don't have the strength to give
Don't wanna stay there
Looking at me missin' everything
When we gonna stop?
When we gonna stop runnin', runnin'?
Instead of doing nothing
We gotta do something!

If I believe there's a Savior
Is the proof in me
Is He alive and breathing
Is He what they'll remember
Is He what they see
When they look at me

Do I look like, look like love?
Do I look like, look like love?"
