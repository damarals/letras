"1" "Always Enough
Kari Jobe

I lift my hands to the Highest, oh God
As I draw near
Surrender my life to your promise, oh God
There is no other
I will find my life in You
You're always enough, always enough
Let the fullness of your love
Be all I need, all I need
Consume me, come like a fire, oh God
Reign in me
For you alone will satisfy, there is no other
I will find my life in You
You're always enough, always enough
Let the fullness of your love
Be all I need, all I need
I will find my life in You
You're always enough, always enough
Let the fullness of your love
Be all I need, all I need
If I have You, I have everything
But without You, I am nothing
I will find my life in You
You're always enough, always enough
Let the fullness of your love
Be all I need, all I need
You're all I need, You're all I need, You're all I need
Always enough for me
If I have You, I have everything
But without You, I am nothing"
