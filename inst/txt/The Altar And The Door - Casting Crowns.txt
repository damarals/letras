"1" "The Altar And The Door
Casting Crowns

Careless, I am wreckless
I'm a wrong way travelling
Slowly unravelling shell of a man
Burnt out, I'm so numb now
That the fire's just an ember
Down in the corner in my cold, cold heart

Lord, this time, I'll make it right
Here at the altar I lay my life
Your kingdom come and my will was done
My heart is broken

As I cry
Like so many times before
But my eyes
Are dry before I leave the floor
Oh, Lord, I try (I'll try)
But this time, Jesus, how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door

Here at the altar
All my world's so black and white
How can I have faltered
What You've shown me to be right

Lord, this time, I'll make it right
Here at the altar I lay my life
Your kingdom come and my will was done
My heart is broken

As I cry
Like so many times before
But my eyes
Are dry before I leave the floor
Oh, Lord, I try (I'll try)
But this time, Jesus, how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door

Trying so hard
Just stop trying so hard
Just let you be who you are
Lord, who You are in me

Jesus, I'm trying so hard
Cause I'm trying so hard
Just let You be who You are
Lord, who You are in me

Oh, Lord, I cry
Like so many times before
But my eyes
Are dry before I leave the floor
Oh, Lord, I try (I'll try)
But this time, Jesus, how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door

Oh, Lord, I cry
Like so many times before
But my eyes
Are dry before I leave the floor
Oh, Lord, I try (I'll try)
But this time, Jesus, how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door"
