"1" "You Will Remain
Vineyard

Though the mountains fall
And the hills give way
Your love for me oh Lord
Will forever stay the same

You will remain my King
You will remain even when the earth gives way

For You alone are my salvation
In You I will not be shaken
You will endure through all generations
Lord, You will remain
Lord, Your love remains
The same

You will remain the same
You will remain the same
Your love remains the same"
