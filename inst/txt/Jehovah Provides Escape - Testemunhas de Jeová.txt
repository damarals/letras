"1" "Jehovah Provides Escape
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

The living God, jehovah, you have proved to be
Your mighty works abound in earth and sky and sea
No rival God can equal what you have done-there is none
Our foes will be consumed

Jehovah provides escape for the loyal
His servants will see what a mighty crag is he
So with courage and faith in our God, we spread the fame
Of jehovah, our source of escape, and praise his name

Though ropes of death encircle me, I call to you
\"Jehovah, give me strength, and give me courage too. \"
From your own temple dwelling, you hear my plea, \"shelter me
Rescue me, o my God. \"
Jehovah provides escape for the loyal
His servants will see what a mighty crag is he
So with courage and faith in our God, we spread the fame
Of jehovah, our source of escape, and praise his name

From heaven you will thunder and give forth your voice
Your enemies will quake; your servants will rejoice
You prove to be whatever you need to be; all will see
How you provide escape

Jehovah provides escape for the loyal
His servants will see what a mighty crag is he
So with courage and faith in our God, we spread the fame
Of jehovah, our source of escape, and praise his name"
