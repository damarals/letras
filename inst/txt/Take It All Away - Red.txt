"1" "Take It All Away
Red

You've stripped me down, the layers fall like rain
It's over now, just innocence and instinct still remain
You watched me while I slowly disappeared
I reached for you to save me; you were frozen in your fear

Take it all away[x4]

Circling the pain inside my soul
I reached inside your silence to steal what you won't show
I tried to find the answers in my fears
But what was found is lost again as soon as it appeared

Take it all away [x4]

I'm breaking; I can't do this on my own
Can you hear me screaming out, am I all alone?

You take away [x10]"
