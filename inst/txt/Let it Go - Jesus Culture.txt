"1" "Let it Go
Jesus Culture

Let a song rise form our souls sing
It day or night, let it go
Straight to the heart of the One
who knows the voice that He's hearing

We are never gonna let this song die out
And We feel the heart of God so we cry out

So Let the sons and daughters
shout with joy and peace and love abound
There's no way we'll ever quiet down our God is alive

We are never gonna let this song die out
And We feel the heart of God so we cry out

To love like only He can love
To become His hands and His feet woah oh oh
We are never gonna let this song die out

We will never look back
We will never look back
We will never look back
You're all we can see now"
