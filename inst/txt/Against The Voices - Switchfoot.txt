"1" "Against The Voices
Switchfoot

Start the day against the voices
The ones that tell me that I'm wrong
I hear them now screaming their delusions
I close my eyes and they're gone

If they ain't singing, if they're just talking
Let them keep talking to themselves

Cause everybody knows
That the hardest war to fight
Is a fight to be yourself in a world
That wants to turn you into someone else

Start the day against the voices
The ones that tell me I don't belong
I hear them now screaming their confusion
I close my eyes and they're gone

If they ain't singing, if they ain't singing
Let them keep talking to themselves

Cause everybody knows
That the hardest war to fight
Is a fight to be yourself in a world
That wants to turn you into someone else

Lalalalaa lalalalalalalaa
Lalalalaa

I close my eyes and they're gone, gone, gone, gone

If they ain't singing, if they ain't singing
Let them keep talking to themselves

Cause everybody knows
That the hardest war to fight
Is a fight to be yourself in a world
Is a fight to be yourself

Cause everybody knows
They ain'tsinging, they're just talking
Let them keep talking to themselves

Cause everybody knows
That the hardest war to fight
Is a fight to be yourself in a world
That wants to turn you into someone else

Yeah-eh-eh-e-e-e-e-e-e-eah
Yeah-eh-eh-eah
