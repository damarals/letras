"1" "At Times Like These
MÃºsicas Gospel

I've been lone-ly and have felt many doubts.
After some of my friends let me down.
I know how it feels when all hope is gone.
And you don't feel that you can go on.

I think in life there's things we must learn.
And our heartaches show us where to turn.
How'd we know when we've won the game,
If we didn't have hurtin, and pain.

I think the reason we all have our knees,
Is so we can pray at times like these,
I think God is watchin' us from above.
At the times that we're needin' love,

I'm glad to say that my bad times are gone,
That lovin' God helps me carry on.
I've had my tears, and conquered my fears,
I'm got a good life, my mind is clear.

I think the reason we all have our knees,
Is so we can pray at times like these,
I think God is watchin' us from above.
At the times that we're needin' love."
