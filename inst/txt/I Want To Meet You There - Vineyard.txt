"1" "I Want To Meet You There
Vineyard

I see You in this place
I bow down to adore
I love Your presence here
But I know there's so much more
I want to see You Jesus
In the broken home
Where the children have no father
And the mother is all alone

I want to meet You there
To spend my love on You
To wait upon Your needs
I want to meet You there

I see You lifted high
You reign forevermore
I know You also live
With the broken and the poor
I want to see You Jesus
Behind the prison doors
The desperate finding mercy
And the hopeless finding hope

The wonder of Your love
Has touched my deepest need
I want to touch You Jesus
In the addict on the street"
