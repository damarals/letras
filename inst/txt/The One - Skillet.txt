Skillet

You love me like no other
You have been the Savior of my life
You know my weekness
You see me beautiful - through your eyes....

Chorus:
And you the one that I need,
The one who makes me complete.
And your the one who is strong,
when I am crying and weak.
And your the one that I love,
the one who never gives up.
And your the one that I - need your the one
your the one

You love me like no other,
You make it easy for my heart to beleive.
And when Im drowning,
Your all the way to rescue me.....

(Repeat Chorus)

I carry all with out knowing ow,
I never NEED how Im needing now...

He loves me like no other.......Your the ONE
(Repeat Chorus)"
