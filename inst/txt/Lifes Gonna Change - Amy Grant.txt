"1" "Life's Gonna Change
Amy Grant

Just like Tarzan swingin' on a vine,
I move out left then come back right,
My life feels like a boomerang throw,
It's far away then it's right back home,

The giant pendulum,
Is swinging to and fro,
This road we're ridin' on where does it go?
And maybe soon it's gonna end but then you never know,

Hard as I try to get it all arranged, }
Life's gonna change. }
Just when I'm used to the pouring rain, } Chorus
That's when the sun starts shining again, }
Life's gonna change. }

While not smile while you got your smile?
The tears might come, might last a while,
You might as well live while you got your life,
'Cos it's a little too late when it's time to die.

The giant pendulum,
Is tickin' off the days,
I only blink and they have passed away,
And that's why every time I turn around I'm still amazed,

Chorus

(Sun is gonna shine)
Sun is gonna shine on me
(Sun is gonna shine)

Chorus

(Life is gonna change nothing ever stays the same)
Life's gonna change,
Just when I'm used to the pouring rain,
That's when the sun starts shining again,
Life's gonna change"
