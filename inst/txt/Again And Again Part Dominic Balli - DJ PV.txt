"1" "Again And Again (Part. Dominic Balli)
DJ PV

I suddenly found myself drifting far from the shore
I was carried away much further than I'd ever gone before
I thought I needed something better
My heart started beating
For empty pleasure
But all I needed was you
Now it's only you
You're all that I want

('cuz) I have found in you my treasure
True no other love will do
So I will give my all and keep on falling in love with you
Again and again again and again over and over again

All of the glamour n' glitz arrayed like alluring lights
They'd shine all day long but left me longing and alone inside
I thought I needed something better
My heart started beating
For empty pleasure
But all I needed was you
Now it's only you
You're all that I want"
