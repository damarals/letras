"1" "All The Way
Delirious

Come close to me, too close for words
And still my beating heart
I find your thoughts without one glance
We're going all the way

With you I'm washed as white as the snow
And all crimson stain becomes just a shadow
You know I would be blind without you
So light up my way to find my way home
Today, today, today, we're going all the way

Tears sometimes fall upon my face
And join the oil of gladness
How can it be I've found this love
A love that let me fly

With you I'm washed as white as the snow
And all crimson stain becomes just a shadow
You know I would be blind without you
So light up my way to find my way home again
Today, today, today, we're going all the way

Today, today, today, we're going all the way"
