"x"
"1" "More Than Fine
Switchfoot

When I wake in the morning
I want to blow into pieces.
I want more than just OK, more than just OK.

When I'm up with the sunrise
I want more than just the blue skies.
I want more than just OK, more than just OK.

I'm not givin' up, givin' up, I'm not givin' up now
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, I'm not backing down.

More than fine, more than bent on getting by.
More than fine, more than just OK.

When I'm lit with the sunshine
I want more than just a good time
I want more than just OK, more than just OK.

I'm not givin' up, givin' up, I'm not givin' up now
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, I'm not selling out.

More than oceans away from the dawn
More than oceans away from who we are.
More than oceans, more than oceans
More than fine."
