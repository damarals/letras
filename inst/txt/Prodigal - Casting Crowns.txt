Casting Crowns

Living on my own, thinking for myself
Castles in the sand, temporary wealth
Walls are falling down, storms are closing in
Tears have filled my eyes, here I am again

And I've held out as long as I can
Now I'm letting go and holding out my hand
Daddy here I am again,
will you take me back tonight
I went and made the world my friend,
and it left me high and dry
I've dragged your name back through the mud
That you first found me in
Not worthy to be called your son
Is this to be my end
Daddy here I am
Here I am again

Curse this morning sun,
drags me in to one more day
I'm reaping what I've sown,
I'm living with my shame
Welcome to my world, and the
life that I have made
One day you're a prince,
the next day you're a slave"
