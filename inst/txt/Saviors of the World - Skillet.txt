"1" "Saviors of the World
Skillet

[Verse 1]
Streets filled with blood, black and red
Dreams and hearts that once knew love are cold and dead

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Breathing rust, it's come to this
We burnt to dust, an apocalypse
But we could live again if we can find ourselves

[Chorus]
We are the saviors of the world
And I will not be ruled
We are kings and conquerors
And I won't bow to you
They will not control us anymore
We will not conform, no, anymore
We are the saviors, the saviors
The saviors of the world

[Verse 2]
Cities will burn, the end is come
Paradise is lost, we wonder what we've done

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Riches rust
The iron fist crashes down on the powerless
But hope could live again if we can find ourselves

[Chorus]
We are the saviors of the world
And I will not be ruled
We are kings and conquerors
And I won't bow to you
They will not control us anymore
We will not conform, no, anymore
We are the saviors, the saviors
The saviors of the world

[Chorus]
We are the saviors of the world
And I will not be ruled
We are kings and conquerors
And I won't bow to you
They will not control us anymore
We will not conform, no, anymore
We are the saviors, the saviors
The saviors of the world"
