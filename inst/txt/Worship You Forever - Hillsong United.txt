"1" "Worship You Forever
Hillsong United

You are god
You are life
And i will worship you forever!

Verse 1:
You knew me before i took my first breath
And you know the day that i will breathe the last
You're the alpha, omega, beginning, and end
Forever to you i sing ~ forever!

Verse 2:
Into your hands i commit my spirit
You're the only one that satisfies my soul
You're the alpha, omega, beginning, and end
Forever to you i sing ~ forever!

(repeat verse 1)

I sing to you!!"
