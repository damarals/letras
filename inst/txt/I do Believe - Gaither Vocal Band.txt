"1" "I do Believe
Gaither Vocal Band

Some say faith
Is just believing
Others say its self deceiving
Veining, childish dreams
To get us through

Deep inside me
Thereâ€™s a yearning
For true wisdom
Not just learning
I'd trade all my clever questions
For one answer that is true

Chorus
I do believe
You are the one
The home I've longed to find
My only hope
God's only Son
I do believe
I touch I see
That all along
You've longed to be
My Lord
My God

Lord You know, I need some answers
Questions eat at me like cancer
Make me once again, a simple child
Help me take the risk of losing
Lose it all to find in choosing
To believe You are the answer
Earth and heaven reconciled

I do believe
You are the one
The home I've longed to find
My only hope
God's only Son
I do believe
I touch I see
That all along
You've longed to be

I do believe
You are the one
The home I've longed to find
My only hope
God's only Son
I do believe
I touch I see
That all along
You've longed to be
My Lord
My God"
