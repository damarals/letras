"1" "Honor Jehovah with Your Valuable Things
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

There's nothing Jehovah could possibly need
He made everything from the start
So what can I give Him, more how can I live
In a way that brings joy to His heart?
Now I know what it takes so with each day that breaks
Here's what I will do

I'll give to you Jehovah the best I have to give
I'll live for you Jehovah as long as I may live
No matter what life brings
I'll honor You with my valuable things

With love in Your heart, You have given us life
And I treasure the joy that it brings
What more can I do to give honor to you
Than to give you my valuable things
Yes, I know what it takes so with each day that breaks
I know what I will do

I'll give to you Jehovah the best I have to give
I'll live for you Jehovah as long as I may live
No matter what life brings
I'll honor You with my valuable things"
