"1" "How I Love You So
Vineyard

You came and opened me
Just like a window pane
You blew right into me

You gave me songs to sing
You gave me dancing feet
You made me come alive

Do You know how I love You so?

You are my summer's day
And sunlight on my skin
Stay here so close to me

Your beauty fills my eyes
So hear me when I say
You're everything to me"
