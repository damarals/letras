"1" "Valley Of Death
Skillet

Days in darkness rolling by
And how the years betray us
And our dreams escape us
The world I wanted turned to night
Love became a shadow
Where did the time go?

Someone said this is all part of the plan
But I don't understand

Now that I walk through the valley of death
You're the light to guide me
When I'm lost and can't see
I'm holding on with all the strength I can
Say you won't forget me
'Cause sometimes I don't believe
That I am not alone in the valley of death

Love and laughter turn to tears
What will come tomorrow?
Is it joy or sorrow?
Memories fading through the years
Now I've got some smile lines
We've had some good times

I can't help wondering how much time is left
'Cause I'm not ready yet

Now that I walk through the valley of death
You're the light to guide me
When I'm lost and can't see
I'm holding on with all the strength I can
Say you won't forget me
'Cause sometimes I don't believe
That I am not alone in the valley of death

When I can't carry on
Enter into the unknown
When I'm with you where I belong
When the night's too hard to take
And the starlight starts to fade
Come and find me, I need to be saved
Before it's too late

Now that I walk through the valley of death
You're the light to guide me
When I'm lost and can't see
I'm holding on with all the strength I can
Say you won't forget me
'Cause sometimes I don't believe (I don't believe)

Now that I walk through the valley of death
(Through the valley of death)
You're the light to guide me (To guide me)
When I'm lost can't see (I can't see)
I'm holding on with all the strength I can
(With the strength that I can)
Say you won't forget me (Forget me)
'Cause sometimes I don't believe (I don't believe)
That I am not alone (I am not alone)
That I am not alone (I am not alone)
That I am not alone
In the valley of death"
