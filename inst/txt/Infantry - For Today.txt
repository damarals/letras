For Today

This breath I take with you in mind.
This war we fight, we'll fight by your side
I'll do anything to keep us together
We'll do anything to give you all exposure
I'll be there to comfort you
At all cost
This world will do anything
to release it's demons
At all costs
We'll fight back with all we have
Making a difference for our God
Let us be more than stories in a book
Make us legends to come
Make us soldiers of men
Bringing strength to the weak
& life to the dead
Hope to the hopeless
Knowing this is a total destruction
Knowing this is a total anhilation
Of my sin, my hurt, and pain
All of these cause us suffering
They can take us to the grave
And we will carry on your name
They can take us to the grave"
