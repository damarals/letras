"1" "Lie Down
P.O.D.

I lie down, I sleep, when I wake, sustain me

Outkast blast through deception, the tension, your mind collapse
Relapse, the stress of matter, when I shatter like glass
The never seen, the never heard style we bring forth Can't ignore,
the Four, ripp'n straight when I take your Title, self, X it out like homicidal
it's vital, to make my flesh be suicidal
We tribal, sing with the Saints, let our spirits fly
Hold down the string with the poser Jah has given I
Break back the chains, release the squeeze off my veins
Empty box, hollow rocks, I knock you out your frame
Shallow grave marks the date, Oh' Babylon the Great
Evil virus, be like Cyrus, trample down your gates
We're the ones, the chosen sons
Come out of dark into light, rather fight than run
We came to die for the reasons you put us down
Don't know when, could have then, what's the time, the time is now

I lie down, I sleep, when I wake, sustain me

Ready, attack, bout' to break you down fast like collision
Religion, take you from vision to flashback
In an instant, calculate precise precision
It's vivid, turn your intimidation to timid
I'm in it, count down to self-destruction
That's word to my mother when you suffer the repercussions
Clear the path, it's the wrath coming through
You ain't got what it takes to make me break
Because I'm harder than you
I'm harder than you
You ain't got what it takes
