Newsboys

We can see it, god you're moving
We can feel it, in our bones
Turn our hearts to all you're doing
With a shout we cry
With a shout we cry

Open wide heaven's gates
Let your glory fill this place
Here we stand in awe
Here we stand in awe
Lifting high every heart
Giving you every part
Here we stand in awe
Here we stand in awe

We are filled with expectation
As we're reaching for your throne
There's an anthem, hear it rising
With a shout we cry
With a shout we cry

There's nothing like your presence god
There's nothing like your presence god
There's nothing like your presence god
There's nothing like your presence god"
