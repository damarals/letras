"1" "You Stand Alone
Hillsong United

I will lay me down at Your feet in worship
And listen to the sweetest sound of all
Oh God You are my God
How my heart it longs for You
Iâ€™m thirsty for Your presence in my world

I cry out night and day for more
To hold the majesty of You

My God You stand alone
And I worship at Your throne
I will long to see Your power and glory
Jesus, Lord of all

Jesus, Lord of all"
