"1" "You Inspire Me
Warren Barfield

Hear the roar of the ocean
Feel the waves at my feet
I'm looking over my shoulder
At the mountain peaks
There's a bird that is whistling
What a wonderful world
And i am so amazed
I have to sing your praise

Chorus:
Cause you
You inspire me, yeah
I see your reflection in everything (everything)
You're moving me
Like a melody whoa
You inspire me
Yeah

Well the driving rain
Sets the beat
The wind is howling a harmony
The clouds roll away
The sun shines a chorus
Your creation sings the words
To songs i've never heard

Bridge:
I want to live a life with passion
That always points to you
Share a love that is wreckless and untamed
Cause you've sketched the world in wonder
And you draw it out of me
The heavens declare your glory
And i want to do the same yeah, yeah
Oh lord, help me do the same"
