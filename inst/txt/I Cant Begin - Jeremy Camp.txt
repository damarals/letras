"1" "I Can't Begin
Jeremy Camp

I've broken everything i've touched
I've even spoken way too much, no matter what i find
Reflect this light you shine to every part of me

(chorus)

I can't begin to even, thank you for the life that you have
lived. I can't pretend to even understand the fullness of your plan. So i just keep on giving all i can

I worry more sometimes than trust,i'm grateful for your
patient touch. i'm finally waking up to see you holding me
Every single time, i go back to the simple things
To trust every word you bring,i know that you have evrything
All i've left is laying at your feet
I'm waitng at your feet now"
