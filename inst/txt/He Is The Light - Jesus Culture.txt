Jesus Culture

I feel the nations of the earth are shaking
There is no power that can match His grace
Lift up your head
Lift up your eyes to see

All of creation is waiting and longing
For sons and daughters to declare His truth
Lift up your head
Lift up your voice and sing

He is the light shining in the darkness
He is the hope, hope of all the nations
He is the light, he is the light
For all the world to see

I feel that faith across the earth is rising
We prophecy about His kingdom coming
Just like heaven
All across the earth

He is the light shining in the darkness
He is the hope, hope of all the nations
He is the light, he is the light
For all the world to see

He is the light shining in the darkness
He is the hope, hope of all the nations
He is the light, he is the light
For all the world to see

And great
Great is the Lord
Praise His Name
Praise His Name

And great
Great is the Lord
Praise His Name
Praise His Name

And we sing Great
Great is the Lord
Praise His Name
Praise His Name

And we sing Great
Great is the Lord
Praise His Name
Praise His Name

He is the light shining in the darkness
He is the hope, hope of all the nations
He is the light, he is the light
For all the world to see

He is the light shining in the darkness
He is the hope, hope of all the nations
He is the light, he is the light
For all the world to see

He is the light shining in the darkness
He is the hope, hope of all the nations
He is the light, he is the light
For all the world to see"
