"1" "Jesus' Blood
Delirious

There's a secret I must tell
Of all the love i've found
And it's hidden in my heart
The day You tore my world apart
Hallelujah, King forever, Friend and Savior

Jesus's blood never fails me
Jesus's blood never fails me
Jesus's blood, Jesus's blood

And this secret, it will run
To the corners of the earth
Where every women, every son
Will carry high their chains undone
Hallelujah King forever, Friend and Saviour

Jesus's blood never fails me
Jesus's blood never fails me
Jesus's blood, Jesus' blood

Sing your songs of freedom
Praise the God of Heaven
Love that never fails me
Jesus' blood, Jesus' blood."
