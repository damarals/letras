"1" "I Lay Me Down
Michael W. Smith

I have found here
Love and mercy
From an infinite supply
I have found here
Living water
From a well that won't run dry

At your feet
I bow in wonder
At your feet
I place my crowns
Let surrender be the only sound
At your feet
I lay me down

Fear and failure
Pride and hatred
You see all I've tried to hide
But sweet mercy
Has embraced me
Wrath has turned to life divine

At your feet
I bow in wonder
At your feet
I place my crowns
Let surrender be the only sound
At your feet
I lay me down

Into my emptiness
You speak life and give me breath
I lay me down
Undone by holiness
Take my all and nothing less
I lay me down

At your feet
I bow in wonder
At your feet
I place my crowns
Let surrender be the only sound
At your feet
I lay me down
At your feet
I lay me down"
