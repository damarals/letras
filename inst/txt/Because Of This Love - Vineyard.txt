"1" "Because Of This Love
Vineyard

Because of this love
You left your place of majesty
To bear my burden on the cross
To redeem humanity
Because of this love
That passes understanding
You chose to draw me close to you
And never turn away

Open my eyes to see your glory
Open my mouth to sing your praise
Open my ears to hear your wisdom
Open my eyes to see your face

Because of this love
You shed your precious blood
Wash away the doubt of sin
Cleanse and make us whole
Because of this love
Love so undeserved
Instill your love inside our hearts
To show to all the world

Open my eyes to see your glory
Open my mouth to sing your praise
Open my ears to hear your wisdom
Open my heart"
