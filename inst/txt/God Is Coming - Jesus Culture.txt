Jesus Culture

In this moment here I am
All I have is in Your hands
You stole my heart so I will wait for You
Your fire of love is breaking through
The old is gone there's something new
You won my heart so I will wait for You

Our God is coming
We can hear the Heavens roar
Hold on get ready for the glory of the Lord

Here You come running to find me
King of the universe
Yes our God is the God who saves
Here You come to light up the darkness
Forever glorious
Yes our God is the God who saves

In a world that's torn apart
Give us courage give us heart
Only You can raise the dead to life
Take our voices keep us strong
Shake the earth with heavens song
Only you can take whats wrong and make it right

Great is the Lord
You are Lord
God is great"
