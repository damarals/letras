"1" "Reign Over Me
Diante do Trono

I'm running to you, my lord
My soul yearns for you
I'm poor, blind and naked
With nothing to offer you
I surrender in your arms, oh god
For I know you take me as I am
I am here to buy your gold
Purify my heart, oh lord

Reign over me
I surrender to you
I surrender to you
Reign over me
My beloved
I wait and I long for you"
