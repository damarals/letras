"1" "You Make Me Sing
Jimmy Needham

The lord reigns let the earth be glad
And let the distant shores rejoice and dance
For all they have
You're making the skies say your name
You're making me do the same

You make me sing
That from forever before the lord he reigns
And you, you make me sing
That from the ends of the earth your song will ring
And so on and on we'll hum these things
Until forever ahead cause you make me sing

You make me sing
You make me sing
You make me sing

The lord gives let the earth receive
And if we turn and seek his face
Then we will see the light of day and be free
And he holds out his hand
I hope that we understand

You make me sing
That from forever before the lord he reigns
And you, you make me sing
That from the ends of the earth your song will ring
And so on and on we'll hum these things
Until forever ahead cause you make me sing

And the seas resound
We hear jubilant sounds
From the air to the ground
From the air to the ground
From the air to the ground

You make me sing
You make me sing
You make me sing

You make me sing
That from forever before the lord he reigns
And you, you make me sing
That from the ends of the earth your song will ring
And so on and on we'll hum these things
Until forever ahead cause you make me sing

You make me sing
You make me sing
You make me sing"
