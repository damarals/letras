"1" "Streangth Of Faith
Italo Villar

It’s necessary to believe God exists
And He loves you more than anything
There is no value in a man
Without faith in his Lord
He is like a body without life

Don’t be like Peter who didn’t believe
When he was already walking over the sea
Be like Abraham that trusted in God
And he believed until the end

Go running to meet the Father
He is now anxiously waiting for you
Don’t give up
Take a step and you will see
With the eyes of faith
That everything will change in your life
He is going to fill you with courage
He is going to give you
Strength for the walk

It’s only by strength of faith
That victory will come"
