Jeremy Camp

Every time I fall down on my face
I see the one who bore all my shame
To know that you are everything I need you to be
You're my ever present help in time of need

I know you understand it all
So why don't I get back on my feet again

Every pain I feel inside my heart
It takes a faith I know I can't depart
To know that you hear every cry I raise to you
Bringing thoughts of hope
The words I bring I know are few

I know you understand it all
So why don't I get back on my feet again

Do you hear me when I call
Are you there when I fall
Do you hear me when I call

I know you understand it all
So why don't I get back on my feet again"
