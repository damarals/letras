"1" "When I Think About The Lord
Hillsong United

When I Think about the Lord,
How He saved me, how He raised me,
how He filled me with the Holy Ghost.
How He healed me to the uttermost.

When I Think about the Lord,
how He picked me up and turned me around,
how He placed my feet on solid ground

Chrous*

It makes me wanna shout,
Hallelujah,
Thank you JESUS,
LORD, your worthy, of all the glory, and all the honor,
and all the praise... (Repeat*)"
