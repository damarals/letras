I'm undefeated

Hands on my neck, foot on my back
Closing in from every side
Bleeding me dry, I'm fading fast

Left for dead but I will rise up on my own
I could make it alone
I got all that I need to survive
(All that I need to survive)
Through the sweat and the blood
I know what I'm made of
It's the hunger that keeps me alive
This time, I'm coming like a hurricane
This time

I came to fight for the love of the game
Unstoppable
That's why I, I'm undefeated
Off the leash, out of the cage, an animal
That's why I, I'm undefeated
I, I, I know I can beat it
Won't give up cause I believe it
Fight for the love of the game, unstoppable
That's why I, I'm undefeated

Here at the edge losing my ground
Stare into the great divide
Pushing me over, pulling me down

Almost dead, but I will rise up on my own
No, I'm never alone
And it's all that I need to survive
(All that I need to survive)
Through the sweat and the blood
If I fall, I'll get up
It's the hunger that keeps me alive
This time, I'm coming like a hurricane
This time

I came to fight for the love of the game
Unstoppable
That's why I, I'm undefeated
Off the leash, out of the cage, an animal
That's why I, I'm undefeated
I, I, I know I can beat it
Won't give up cause I believe it
Fight for the love of the game, unstoppable
That's why I, I'm undefeated

All the strength that I have
All the life that's left in me
I will give every breath
To be everything I can be
I, I, I'm undefeated
I, I, I'm undefeated

I came to fight for the love of the game
Unstoppable
That's why I, I'm undefeated
Off the leash, out of the cage, an animal
That's why I, I'm undefeated
I, I, I know I can beat it
Won't give up cause I believe it
Fight for the love of the game, unstoppable
That's why I, I'm undefeated
That's why I, I'm undefeated"
