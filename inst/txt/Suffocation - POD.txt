"1" "Suffocation
P.O.D.

Breathe!
Suffocation within
because of what your sayin'
To understand!
Is to begin again
Yet to Begin!
Is to live again
I tried living my life through your eyes
Smother me with your ways, to death, no breath.
Your choking what little faith I have left.
In time I find the truth lies, Inside the truth lies, Inside
Breathe!
Suffocation within
because of what your sayin'
To understand!
Is to begin again
Yet to Begin!
Is to live again
I would die, to breathe again
I would die, to breathe again
I would die, to breathe again
I would die, to breathe again
Breathe!
Suffocation
I want to Breathe!
Suffocation
I understand
I would die, to breathe again
I would die, to breathe again
Breathe"
