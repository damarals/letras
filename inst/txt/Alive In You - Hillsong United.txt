"1" "Alive In You
Hillsong United

[Verse 1]
Calling all believers
New life found within the cross of Christ
For He is risen
Seated high and lifted above all
Above all

[Pre-Chorus]
All around the world
We sing Your praise
The anthem of creation
Our God reigns

[Chorus]
Let the name of Jesus
Forever be glorified
We are alive in You
We are alive in You

[Verse 2]
Redemption story
Our lives freely given life to see
Salvation drawing
All hearts finding hope in Christ alone
In Christ alone

[Bridge]
You are risen
You are risen
You are risen
Christ our Saviour

(You alone can satisfy)
(You alone created life)
(You alone are crowned as)
Christ our Saviour
(You alone set captives free)
(You alone have rescued me)
(You alone are Jesus)
Christ our Saviour"
