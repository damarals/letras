"1" "Shine For You
Hillsong United

ONE THING I'VE KNOWN
IS THAT YOU CHANGED MY LIFE
I GIVE YOU MY ALL
ALL YOU ARE IS GOOD

I GIVE YOU MY HEART
GOD IT'S ONLY YOU I SEEK
GIVE YOU MY PRAISE
'CAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU

LOOK ACROSS THE WORLD
AND LET US SHINE FOR YOU LORD
THE WHOLE WORLD IS YOURS AND I
WANT TO LIVE FOR YOU OH GOD

ALL THAT I KNOW
IS THAT YOU CHANGED MY LIFE
I GIVE YOU MY ALL
ALL YOU ARE IS GOOD

I CARRY THE LAWS
MAKE MY PRAYER IN THIS LIFE REAL
CARRY MY CROSS
AND HOLD ON 'TIL I SEE YOU
I WANT TO LIVE
I WANT TO LOVE YOU MORE
I WANT TO BE USED

FATHER IN ALL OF THE WORLD
MAY YOUR WORD BE HEARD
MAY IT STAY ON MY LIPS
TO LIVE WHAT I SPEAK
UNTIL YOUR KINGDOM COME"
