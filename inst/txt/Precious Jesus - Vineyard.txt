Precious Jesus
Lord of all
I come before You
I humbly fall
I want to know You
More than anything
I want to love You
With my everything

I've been touched by Your saving love
Become lost in Your amazing grace
And my heart is overwhelmed
At the beauty of Your ways
And here and now I stand
And say I'm forever Yours
Jesus You're my all in all
And I will sing Your praise"
