"1" "Hide Thou Me
Gaither Vocal Band

Ohh...then I cried oh rock of ages
Hhide thou me

Sometimes I feel discouraged
And I think my works in vain
I'm tempted oft(en) to murmur
To grumble and complain
Ohh...but then I think of Jesus
And all he's done for me

Then I cry
Ohh...rock of ages
Hide thou me
Ohh...rock of ages
Hide thou me

There is no other refuge
Can save but the
And through this dark world
I've wondered far, far from thee

Then I cry
Ohh...rock of ages
Hide (dear Lord) thou me
(hide thou me)"
