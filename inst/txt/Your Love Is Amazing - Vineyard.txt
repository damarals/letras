"1" "Your Love Is Amazing
Vineyard

Your love is amazing, steady and unchanging,
Your love is a mountain, firm beneath my feet,
Your love is a mystery, how you gently lift me,
When i am surrounded, your love carries me.


Chorus:
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, your love makes me sing,
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, your love makes me sing.


Verse 2:
Your love is surprising, i can feel it rising,
All the joy that's growing deep inside of me,
Every time i see you, all your goodness shines through,
And i can feel this god song, rising up in me.


Bridge:
Yes, you make me sing,
Lord, you make me sing, sing, sing,
How you make me sing."
