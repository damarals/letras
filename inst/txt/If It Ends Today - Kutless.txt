"1" "If It Ends Today
Kutless

Seems like the end is coming
Seems like the signs are lining up
As far as I can see

We're closer now than ever
This pain won't last forever
Love love is on his way

So stand up the time is now to lift up your head

Raise your hands if you're with me
Raise your hands if you're ready
Say hey! hey! I'm not afraid
Hey! hey! hey! if it ends today

There's hope on our horizon
Let it be the sound that's rising up
It's rising up

We could be the generation
To shout out to every nation
Love love is on his way

Get ready
Are you ready? (I'm ready!)
Get ready

Raise your hands if you're with me
Raise your hands come on and say
Say hey! hey! I'm not afraid
Hey! hey! hey! if it ends today"
