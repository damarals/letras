Vineyard

I'm resting in Your presence
Here is where I want to be
I'm resting in Your presence
To worship at the feet of my King

And I love to be with You
For here I know I'll be changed
Jesus wrap Your arms around me
Ever so gently, ever so gently

I'm resting in Your presence
Safe beneath the shadow of Your wings
I'm resting in Your presence
For You are my refuge and peace"
