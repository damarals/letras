"1" "Fight The Silence
For Today

Eye to eye, face to face
Still we don't see them, we look away
Still they cry, but no one is listening
When will we open our eyes?

Open our eyes

This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries?
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes?

So let the world listen closely
As I scream to see the freedom, they deserve
Let the world listen closely
I say it's time to cross the line

Preying on poverty
They keep us uninformed and distracted
If they can't fight for themselves
We'll fight for them
It's time to fight the silence

Broken, abused, and exploited
For the sick satisfaction of selfish men
Only a coward would try to ignore it
But we can raise our voice
And bring this to an end

Fight, fight, fight the silence
Set the captives free
Fight, fight, fight the silence
They're a slave to a system of apathy

Bought and sold, their right of life has been taken away
Bought and sold, bring an end to slavery

Open our eyes

This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries?
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes?

Their fate is in our hands
Will they be left there to suffer?
Will somebody take a stand?
Against a system that's been designed
To deny its victims their right to life
Let's set the captives free

When all is said and done
We'll see justice come
It's time to fight the silence
The voice of the voiceless
Fight the silence
We are the hope for the hopeless
Fight the silence
Fight, fight, fight the silence
It's time to fight"
