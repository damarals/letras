Jesus Culture

Verse 1:
Words could never say, the way
He says my name
He calls me lovely
No one ever sees, the way
He looks at me
He sees me holy
Words could never hold, this love that burns my soul
Heaven holds me
Heaven holds me

Chorus:
I can’t hold my love back from you
I can’t hold my love back from you
I’ve gotta sing, I’ve gotta sing, sing my love

Verse 2:
You would not believe, the way
He touches me
He burns right through me
And I could not forget, every word He said
He always knew me
The earth could never hold, this love that burns my soul
Heaven holds me
Heaven holds me

Chorus 2:
Oh praise the Lord, praise the Lord
My soul makes, makes its boast, in the Lord"
