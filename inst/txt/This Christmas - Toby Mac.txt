"1" "This Christmas
Toby Mac

Joy to the world
Let heaven and nature sing
Let heaven and nature sing

Now Jonnie never got his wish on December 25
That's what he said when he left the orphanage
9 years old, but Jonnie was an old soul
Gonna spend his first Christmas in a real home
Showed me a picture that he drew the night before
Was a picture of a man standin' outside a door
I asked him who it was and he said someone I only
see in dreams
Comforts me when I cry myself to sleep
Father of the fatherless
Be with your sons and daughters this Christmas
This Christmas
Believe in angels?
Jonnie asked me starin' at the sky
I said I do and saw a sparkle in his eye
Big brother for the weekend respondin' to the season
Took the chance that givin's better than recievin'
Two nights, a new family, some holiday cheer
We laughed and sang
Came on a midnight clear
We gave, recieved, and as we headed to close
We looked to the heavens and it started to snow
Down blessings
Father of the fatherless
Be with your sons and daughters this Christmas
(You ain't livin' til you choose to give love and joy and
peace to one of His)
Father let us not forget
The children who are all alone this Christmas
(You ain't livin' til you choose to give, you ain't livin' til
You choose to give)
(James 1:27)
Religion that God our Father
Accepts as pure and faultless is this
To look after orphans and widows in their distress
Merry Christmas everyone
Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let heaven and nature sing
Let heaven and nature sing
Let heaven and nature sing
Let heaven and nature sing
Believe in angels Jonnie asked me starin' at the sky
I said I do and saw a sparkle in his eye
9 years old, but Jonnie was an old soul
Gonna spend is next Christmas in a real home"
