[Verse 1]
Fate has escaped
Tell me what have we become
Break another chain
How long before I'm undone
Frailty, frailty lost inside

[Verse 2]
Wake, unafraid
A new day, a new time is here
Worlds fade away
I'll laugh while they all disappear
Frailty, frailty lost inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Violent delights
Growing inside

[Chorus]
Show me a sign
Let me know you're alive
What have we done
It's the end of your age
I have begun

[Verse 3]
Wake, unafraid
A new day, a new time is here
Worlds fade away
I'll laugh while they all disappear
Frailty, frailty

[Chorus]
Show me a sign
Let me know you're alive
What have we done
It's the end of your age
I have begun

[Bridge]
These are the final hours
These are the final hours now
Watching it all burn down

[Chorus]
Show me a sign
Let me know you're alive
What have we done
It's the end of your age
I have begun"
