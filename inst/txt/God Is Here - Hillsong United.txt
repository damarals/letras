"1" "God Is Here
Hillsong United

In Your presence there is fullness of life
And healing flowing for body, soul and mind
God of miracles, God of the impossible is here
God is here

God is here, let the broken hearted rejoice
God is here, let the sick say I am well!
God is here let the weak say I am strong
God is here, His wonder to perform
In Your presence there is perfect peace
In the stillness I behold Your deity
God of wonder, God of power is here
God is here
O' His wonder yes His wonders
His wonders to perform."
