Hillsong United

Cause it is not a human right
To stand afar
While broken nations dream
Open up our eyes, so blind
That we might find
The Mercy for the need

(Singing) Hey Now
Fill our hearts with your compassion
Hey Now
As we hold to our confession
Yeah

It is not too far a cry
To much to try
To help the least of these
Politicians should not decide
If we should rise
And be your hands and feet

Singing Hey Now
Fill our hearts with your compassion
Hey Now
As we hold to our confession

Woah-oh-oh,
God be their solution
Woah-oh-oh
We will be Your hands and be Your feet.
Yeah, yeah

Higher than our circumstance
You promise and
Your love for all to see
Higher than protest lines and dollar signs
Your love is all we need

(singing) Hey now
Fill our hearts with your compassion
Hey now
As we hold to our confession

Woah-oh-oh
God,be their solution
Woah-oh-oh
We will be Your hands and be Your feet

Only you can mend the broken heart
And cause the blind to see
Erase complete the sinner's past
And set the captives free
Only you can take the widow's cry
And cause the heart to sing
Be a father to the fatherless
Our savior and our king
We will be your hands, we will be your feet
We will run this race
On the darkest place, we will be your light
We will be your light
We will be your hands, we will be your feet
We will run this race for the least of these
In the darkest place, we will be your light
We will be your light

Woah-oh-oh
God,be their solution
Woah-oh-oh
We will be Your hands and be Your feet

Woah-oh-oh
God,be their solution
Woah-oh-oh
We will be Your hands and be Your feet

We will run we will run
We will run with the solution
We will run we will run
We will run with the solution

We will be your hands we will be your feet
We will run this race for the least of these
In the darkest place we will be your light
We will be your light"
