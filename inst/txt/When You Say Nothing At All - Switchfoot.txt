"1" "When You Say Nothing At All
Switchfoot

It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.

Without saying a word you can light up the dark.

Try as I may I can never explain, what I hear when you dont say a thing.

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me theres a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me the truth of your hand will say that youll never catch me where ever I fall, you say it best, when you say nothing at all.

All day long I can hear people talking out loud.
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd, try as I may they can never define whats been said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me, theres a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me the touvh of your hand will say that youll never catch me where ever I fall you say it best when you say nothing at all

Oh, the smile on your face lets me know that you need me theres a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me the touvh of your hand will say that youll never catch me where ever I fall you say it best when you say nothing at all"
