"1" "The Roar
Chris Tomlin

I waited for the lord
He turned and heard my cry
His mercy opened up my eyes
When I couldn't see and my strength was failing me
I heard the roar of the lion of judah
I heard the voice that calms the raging sea
He came to me, came to me
When I needed the lord
I heard the roar of the lion of judah

I waited for the lord
He appeared in blinding light
He led me through the darkest night
When I couldn't see and my strength was failing me
I heard the roar of the lion of judah
I heard the voice that calms the raging sea
He came to me, came to me
When I needed the lord
I heard the roar of the lion of judah

I lifted my hands
He lifted me out
All praise to the savior, all worship to God
With all that I am
With all in my heart
All praise to the savior, all worship to God
I heard the roar of the lion of judah
I heard the voice that calms the raging sea
He came to me, came to me
When I needed the lord
I heard the roar of the lion of judah
You came to me, came to me
When I needed you, lord
I heard the roar of the lion of judah
I heard the roar of the lion of judah"
