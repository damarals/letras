A voice screaming from within
Begging just to feel again
Can't find who I am without you near me
I'd give anything to live
Cause without you I don't exist
Your the only one who saves me from myself
I've been in this love and laid it to rest
And now I'm one of the forgotten

I'm not, I'm not myself
Feel like I'm someone else
Fallen and faceless
So hollow, hollow inside
A part of me is dead
Need you to live again
Can you replace this?
I'm hollow, hollow and faceless

Shadows growing in my mind
Ones I just can't leave behind
I'm not strong enough to pay this ransom
One more monster crawled inside
But I swear I saw it die
Can you save me from the nothing I've become?
I've been in this love and laid it to rest
And now I'm one of the forgotten

I'm not, I'm not myself
Feel like I'm someone else
Fallen and faceless
So hollow, hollow inside
A part of me is dead
Need you to live again
Can you replace this?
I'm hollow, hollow and faceless

I'm faceless
I'm hollow and faceless
Faceless
Faceless

I'm, I'm not myself
Feel like I'm someone else
Fallen and faceless
So hollow, hollow inside
A part of me is dead
Need you to live again
Can you replace this?
I'm hollow, hollow and faceless!
Faceless!"
