"1" "Glorious Day (Living He Loved Me)
Casting Crowns

One day when heaven
Was filled with His praises
One day when sin
Was as black as could be
Jesus came forth to be
Born of a virgin
Dwelt among men, my example is He

Word became flesh
And the light shined among us
His glory revealed

Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified
Freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day

One day they led Him up
Calvary's mountain
One day they nailed Him
To die on a tree
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected
Bearing our sins, my
Redeemer is He

Hands that healed nations
Stretched out on a tree
And took the nails for me

Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified
Freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day

One day the grave could
Conceal Him no longer
One day the stone rolled
Away from the door
Then He arose, over death He had conquered
Now He's ascended
My Lord evermore

Death could not hold Him
The grave could not Keep Him
From rising again

Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified
Freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day
Glorious day

One day the trumpet
Will sound for His coming
One day the skies with
His glories will shine
Wonderful day, my
Beloved One, bringing
My savior, Jesus, is mine

Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified
Freely forever
One day He's coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day
Glorious day
Oh glory day"
