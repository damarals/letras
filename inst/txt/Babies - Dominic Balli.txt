Life, Death, Eternity
Then hope, peace, no more suffering
And it’s all we’ll ever know
But when you loose your own the notes all sound the same
The strings all play same
Still my heart
remains in pain

Chorus:
I’m living for the day when my eyes be fixed upon sweet Zion
Then my strength shall
remain in God alone
All I’ve been living for I’ll hold

Yeah I’ll hold you and I’ll never go away
I’ll never go away
They took your picture
We hung dem pictures
And your big sister waitin for her brothers, Zion and Hezekiah
Daddy and Momma, Grandma and Grandpa, Nani and Papa, Mama and Tata been waiting for ya
How could our babies go away

Chorus: We’re living for the day when our eyes be fixed
upon sweet Zion
Then my strength shall remain in God alone
All I’ve been living for I’ll
hold
Until then I’m living for the day when my eyes be fixed upon sweet Zion
Then my
strength shall remain in God alone
All I’ve been living for I’ll hold

Yeah I’ll hold you and
I’ll never go away
I’ll never go away
We’ll never go away
And you’ll never go way"
