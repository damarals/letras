"1" "He Is God Alone
The Edwin Hawkins Singers

(choir) Look to the hills from whence cometh your help
All your help cometh from the Lord
No matter the problem, He can solve them
He is God alone

(lead) He will not suffer thy foot to be moved
He that keepeth thee will not slumber nor sleep
Any time day or night call Him up He’ll make it all right
For He is God alone

(choir Look to the hills from whence cometh your help
&lead All your help cometh from the Lord
ad lib) No matter the problem, He can solve them
He is God alone

(lead) He will not suffer thy foot to be moved (no)
He that keepeth thee will not slumber nor sleep
Any time day or night call Him up; He’ll make it all right
For He is God alone

(choir There is no problem too hard
& lead Nor situation He can’t resolve
ad lib) Just trust Him and He, will set you free
He is God alone (2x)

He is God alone (a joy for my soul, yes He is)

He is God alone (Yes, He)

He is God
He is God
He is God
He is…God (4x)

Ending:
He is God alone (3x)"
