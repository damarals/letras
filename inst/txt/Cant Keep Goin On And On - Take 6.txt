"1" "Can't Keep Goin' On And On
Take 6

Sometimes I feel so all alone
Heartache is like a danger zone
Somewhere there is a better place
Out there where love will find a way

Channel:
I know this train is rollin', I feel the track
I don't know where it's goin' nut it's always rollin'
Right back where we started, déjà vu
This train of brokenhearted souls

Chorus:
I can't keep goin' on and on
I can't keep goin' on and on
I've been on this train so long
I can't keep goin' on and on

Faith knows that everything will change
Someday there'll be no more pain

Channel

Chorus"
