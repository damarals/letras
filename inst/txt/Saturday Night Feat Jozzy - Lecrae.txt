"1" "Saturday Night (Feat. Jozzy)
Lecrae

Is this real?
This is all unknown
Makes me feel
Is this real?
Going down and back and forth
And all these ways it makes me numb now
I can't feel
Is this real?

Here I am in the club again, yeah
Caged like Wrestle Mania
Girls want a rapper, ain't he one?
Dudes want a macadamia
Never had love for none of the drugs
But I wonder, can the fame be one?
I don't know none of these people
But order some drinks, let's numb the pain with them
And I probably look content
I mean I made a couple hits
I know celebs and all
And what I wear can pay the rent
But on the inside I'm sick
I know I'm bound to fall
I'm chasing the world and its pleasures
Careful about what you treasure
Can you put 24's on a Tesla?
I wonder the best ways to measure

Measures of success
They hate you and admire"
