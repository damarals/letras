Bicycle Gasoline

I'm a stranger with the one I love.
She's so beautiful, she's sent from above.
I'm in love with the beauty of my youth.
When I met you I was half a man,
I couldn't walk but together we ran.
I know we can.

She don't need no bicycle gasoline,
She just needs her violets.
She don't need no bicycle gasoline,
She just needs her violets.

I remember when it wasn't this way.
You were complete when you found me astray.
Thank you, you're here today.
In your arms I'm the king of the road,
In your heart I'm forever at home.
I'm alive when I lose myself in you.

Then you come to me sunlight in your hair.
A moment out of time, world with out a care.
And when it's crowding in, you take me far away.
When you're singing la la la la.
