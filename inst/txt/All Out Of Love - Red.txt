"1" "All Out Of Love
Red

So I feel like taking all my feelings
And throwing them all at the wall
So I won't have to cry no more
The older I'm feeling
Needing it a little more to hold
Back that screaming
Demons and all

An if you feel like taking on my mind
Show me where to find a place I can hide
So I can throw all my fears aside

Old, now I feel it, I feel a little more
I'm low now I need it, needing it all

All out of love
So tired of sinking thinking will I wake up
When will I stop
That place where I went felt so long ago
I'm scared I could go back

And while we wait for that
That special day we hope
Someone somewheres gonna make it ok
And while we wait for that
That special day we hope
Someone somewhere is gonna take us away

All out of love
So tired of sinking thinking will I wake up
When will I stop
When that place where I went felt so long ago
I'm scared I could go back"
