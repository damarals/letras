"1" "Let It Come
Vineyard

Jesus, hear my prayer
I want to see the lost come home
See the broken hearts made whole

Jesus, hear my prayer
I want to see the sick made well
See the world find love that's real

Jesus, hear my prayer
I want to see the hungry fed
See new lives rise from the dead

I want to see Your Kingdom come
I want to see Your will be done
Here on earth, just like heaven
Now is the time for salvation

Let it come (4x)"
