"x"
"1" "Good Stuff
Newsboys

if i tell you something you need to know
i gotta back it up
i gotta let it show
we can be so loud
we can write a song that makes us all proud
but without love
it's just a sound

everybody show what we know
and let that good stuff flow
everybody show what we know
and let that good stuff flow

i could speak with tongues of Angels
apologetics in a slick rhetoric
either way without love my words are dead
we have love
we have forgiveness
we have grace without a limit
so if it has been revealed to us
should it not then be contagious?

we got the rhythm
we got the rhyme
print up a t-shirt
throw them a line

but without love we are nothing
