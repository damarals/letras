"x"
"1" "First Love
Amy Grant

Sweet and gentle as the night.
Just being near you now,
Is like a lullaby.

All that I have I give away to follow you,
I can't imagine having life without you, oh....

When all thesee worldly battles,
Seem to never cease,
You simply lift me up,
And rest me in Your peace.

I heard some people say, You're only in my mind.
I hope that someday, You'll choose to find them.

All other loves will slowly fade,
Like dying flame.
Tomorrow, now, and yesterday,
You're still the same.

I wake with a longing heart to see you come again;
Your sweet and tender love will never end.
