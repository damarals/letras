Third Day

Father of love, father of lights
Let your love fall, let it shine bright
You alone deserve the honor and the glory
You alone deserve all our praise
So we worship you and you alone

Great and marvelous are your deeds

Just and true are your ways
So we praise you and you alone
Father of truth, father of grace
Be with us now fill this place

We magnify your name
We lift you up and praise

Lord, God almighty

Father of love, father of lights

Let your love fall, let it shine bright
Let your love fall, let it shine bright
So we worship you and you alone"
