"1" "Jesus Lover Of My Soul
The Edwin Hawkins Singers

Jesus, lover of my soul
Let me to thy bosom fly
While the nearer waters roll
While the tempest still is high

Jesus, lover of my soul
Let me to thy bosom fly
While the nearer waters roll
While the tempest still is high

Hide me in your heart in your heart
Till the storm of happiness
Safe me to my heaven's god
And receive my soul at last
And receive my soul at last

Hide me in your heart in your heart
Till the storm of happiness
Safe me to my heaven's god
And receive my soul at last
And receive my soul at last

Jesus, lover of my soul
Let me to thy bosom fly
While the nearer waters roll
While the tempest still is high

Jesus, lover of my soul
Let me to thy bosom fly
While the nearer waters roll
While the tempest still is high

Hide me in your heart in your heart
Till the storm of happiness
Safe me to my heaven's god
And receive my soul at last
And receive my soul at last

Hide me in your heart in your heart
Till the storm of happiness
Safe me to my heaven's god
And receive my soul at last
And receive my soul at last

Jesus, lover of my soul
Jesus, lover of my soul
Jesus, lover of my soul
Jesus, lover of my soul"
