"1" "Saviour Christ The King
Hillsong United

I hope for all to come together
To love each other this Christmas
That war would cease and God would dwell
Inside of every heart of man
To wish each other well

For this reason Christ came to earth
Behold the joy in His birth
He brings freedom
Saviour Christ, the King

For God so came to us one night
That we might have salvation
And now to nations we proclaim
The blessed reign of Jesus

And in our hearts let praises be heard
Hallelujah, the power in His word
Let every heart know
Saviour Christ, the King"
