"1" "I Hide In You
Vineyard

Lord hear my prayer
Your righteousness is my relief

My spirit fails
Don't hide from me
I meditate
On all the works that You have done

I spread my hands
Thirsting for You
Let the morning light

Speak of Your love
Unfailing Father
Come rescue me

From my enemies
I hide in You

Teach me Your will
For You're my God my one desire

Good Spirit lead me
On level ground"
