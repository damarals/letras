"x"
"1" "Intercession
Kirk Franklin

Jesus please mention my name
When you talk to your father today
Life down here feels so strained
My brokenness is in the way
I'm not that good
Don't pray like I should
Yet I'm amazed you get me through
He see's me but he hears you

He hears you
That's why I need you

Jesus please mention my name
See I got some bad news today
Be nice if you can carry this weight
See its got me questioning my faith
What else to do
The safest place to hide is you
You are the door I now walk through
He see's me cos he hears you

He hears you
That's why I need you
Can't help but love you
Jesus I appreciate you

He intercedes for me
Protects me from things unseen
Right between God and me
He intercedes for me
(x2)

He's standing up for me
Forward I shall yet be
Soon our whole world will see
He intercedes for me
(x2)

Jesus that's why I need you
That's why I need you
Appreciate you
Can't help but love you"
