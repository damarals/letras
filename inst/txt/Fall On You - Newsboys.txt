"1" "Fall On You
Newsboys

seen it all
heard the talk
heart unturned
watch you leaving

some things have to fall on you
some things have to fall on you

i lift you up
pray for grace
love you more
still you run away
and â€¦

what makes a man aware of his need
is it by faith, by words or by deed
for your heart to be broken, to truly be sent home
some things have to fall on you

spirit saves
letter kills
plant the seed
i'll be waiting

some things have to fall on you
spirit has to fall
it's true
