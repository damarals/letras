"1" "My Refuge
Alessandra Samadello

He is the way, the life, he is the healing word
Deep in my heart, I know that all I need is the Lord
When I?m lost in fear, to His arms he brings me near
He gave me life, now I am free to fly

His love is the grace that falls upon my heart
His love is the place where I find no harm
I know I can trust him, He is my refuge
His love is the boundless poise of harmony
He is my salvation, He has set me free
I know I can trust him, He is my refuge

He is the way, the life, he is the healing word
Deep in my heart, I know that all I need is the Lord
When I?m lost in fear, to His arms he brings me near
He gave me life, now I am free to fly

His love is the grace that falls upon my heart
His love is the place where I find no harm
I know I can trust him, He is my refuge
His love is the boundless poise of harmony
He is my salvation, He has set me free
I know I can trust him, He is my refuge

He is the way, He is the light, He is shinning star
We are safe in His arms of love, in the arms of God

His love is the grace that falls upon my heart
His love is the place where I find no harm
I know I can trust him, He is my refuge
His love is the boundless puise of harmony
He is my salvation, He has set me free
I know I can trust him, He is my refuge
He is my refuge
He is my refuge
He is my refuge."
