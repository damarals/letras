"1" "Balm Of Gilead
Vineyard

You're the Rock of Ages
You're the Balm of Gilead
Make us strong and courageous
Heal the wounds that we've had

Chorus:
We need Your Spirit
We need freedom
We need Your Spirit
We need freedom
We need You
We need You

You're the Counselor from heaven
You're the Bright and Morning Star
You bring comfort and protection
Shine Your light in my heart"
