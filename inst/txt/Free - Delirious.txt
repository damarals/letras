Free

I'm feeling feel fine
'cos there's nothing that I want to change
I'm right on time
for the atmosphere to rearrange
'Cos I've got wings so watch me fly

And I'm free to be the man you want me to be
I'm alive when I'm alive in you
And I'm free to be the one you said I could be
I'm alive 'cose you're alive, I'm alive when I'm alive in you

Lord, youve let me see
I need strength to let you carry me
And love was right on time
When faith and hope were on the line
And I've got wings so watch me fly

And I'm free to be the man you want me to be
I'm alive when I'm alive in you
And Im free to be the one you dreamt I could be
Im alive cos youre alive, Im alive cos youre alive
Im alive cos youre alive in me

Youre all I ever want
Youre all I ever need
Its all I ever want
To be free
