"1" "The Payback
P.O.D.

Nobody move, Nobody gets hurt for all it's worth
State of Emergency, red alert
I'm takin you for your currency,
service these stocks and bonds through off-shore accounts
from Cuba to Taiwan (But It's already poppin)
Bout to flip the script on these poli-tricks (profit for the hood)
So i can chisel the government (who's runnin this?)
SonDread from playa's callin shots (callin all blocks)
Come clap your hands off the timing (run these streets)
Money fallin down like rain (let's run these streets)
The hoods cashin in to a back pay (let's run these streets)
It's time to come up with our fists, soul stealer from the rock
and makin everybody rich

The Payback, it's The Payback
Come follow me and we can all get paid
The Payback, it's The Payback
We makin money fallin down like rain
The Payback, it's The Payback
Come follow me and we can all get paid
The Payback, it's The Payback
Top of the world and all The Payback

Nobody move, Nobody gets hurt for all it's worth
Payin back the streets all they deserve (poverty was meant to keep the people oppressed)
That's why operation Mr. BG is now the progress (like a fool said)
Take a dip to his mansion, and gate-nap this cat
and make the call for his ransom (what you askin?)
The plan is you will deliver every family in America about six figures
(Your still richer) With more money than you can spend
(Your still richer) With more money than you can lend
(Your still richer) And just pretend all ya need
Give it all to the community, but hey that's just me

The Payback, it's The Payback
Come follow me and we can all get paid
The Payback, it's The Payback
We makin money fallin down like rain
The Payback, it's The Payback
Come follow me and we can all get paid
The Payback, it's The Payback
Top of the world and all The Payback

Nobody move, Nobody move
Nobody move, Nobody gets hurt
Nobody move, Nobody gets hurt
Nobody move, Nobody gets hurt
Nobody move, Nobody gets hurt
Nobody move, Nobody gets hurt!
Nobody move, Nobody gets hurt!
Nobody move, Nobody gets hurt!
Nobody move!

The Payback, it's The Payback
Come follow me and we can all get paid
The Payback, it's The Payback
We makin money fallin down like rain
The Payback, it's The Payback
Who'll know the face but you'll remember the name
The Payback, it's The Payback
Top of the world and all The Payback
