"1" "Beautiful God
Vineyard

You are warm like the sunshine
On a bright summer day
You are clear as the blue sky when
the clouds have rolled away
You are gentle as the evening breeze
That blows against my face
And I love to be with you Beautiful God
Oh I love to be with you Beautiful God

You protect me with your arms of love
And you take away my fear
I'm reaching out my hands to you
'Cause I know that you are near
Lord I'll whisper words of tenderness
Which only you can hear
And I love to be with you Beautiful God
Oh I love to be with you Beautiful God

As my love for you grows strong
Close to you is where I long to be
As I gaze into your eyes
Such a look of pure delight I see
Lord you're smiling at me"
