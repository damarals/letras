"1" "Edge of My Seat
Switchfoot

Nothing more
That there's nothing more

Nothing here's the same
It's all a dream
Life on a movie screen
And I'm sitting on the
Edge of my seat

I can't tell what happens next
Just what I've seen
Don't know what it means
But I'm holding on the
Edge of my seat

I can't forget your name
Forget your name
Yeah, I can't forget you
Now I know
I can't forget you girl

I promise
Sit back, buckle in
And hold on tight
A roller coaster ride
And I'm holding on the
Edge of my seat

And I don't know for sure
'Cause I just landed
On your shore
But I think you've got nothing
But another thing comin'
If you think there's nothing more
That there's nothing more
