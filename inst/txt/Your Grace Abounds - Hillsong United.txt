"1" "Your Grace Abounds
Hillsong United

You lay aside Your throne
And to this world
You have come
You offered up Your life
The debt You paid
Was not Yours

Your grace abounds to me,
Your grace abounds to me
Jesus, in You I find all that I need

A gift I could not earn
Your open arms
Are undeserved
Enabled by Your grace
Now to live
Is Christ alone

All powerful
All glorious
There's nothing like the name of Jesus

All powerful
All glorious
There's nothing like Your name"
