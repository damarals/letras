"1" "Heart Of My Beat
Toby Mac

I think about my life, I get emotional
Take the glory, You can have it all
You can have it all, You can have it all

From the start to eternity
You are the fresh air I breathe
You will always be
The heart of my beat, the heart of my
You put the soul in my melodies
I write the songs in Your key
Yeah, You will always be
The heart of my beat, the heart of my

Been up on mountains, down to the valleys
Hit every city on the way over to Cali (Cali)
I never dreamed that we would take it this far
But every time I turn You open the door
Look in the rearview, I catch the big plan
In every twist and every turn, I see Your good hand
You got that grip and You never let go, huh
You got that grip, yeah, You never let go

You put the life in my lungs when the passion's dead
You're the beautiful thoughts fillin' up my head
You pull the curtains back an' my mind is blown
Let's go, let's go, let's go

From the start to eternity
You are the fresh air I breathe
You will always be
The heart of my beat, the heart of my
You put the soul in my melodies
I write the songs in Your key
Yeah, You will always be
The heart of my beat, the heart of my

To some it's religion, to some it's my vision
I'm keepin' no secrets about Your provisions
It's always been You
How could they get it twisted?
It's always been You
Tell me, how could they miss it?

You put the life in my lungs when the passion's dead
You're the beautiful thoughts fillin' up my head
You pull the curtains back an' my mind is blown
Let's go, let's go, let's go

From the start to eternity
You are the fresh air I breathe
You will always be
The heart of my beat, the heart of my
You put the soul in my melodies
I write the songs in Your key
Yeah, You will always be
The heart of my beat, the heart of my

You put the life in my lungs when the passion's dead
You're the beautiful thoughts fillin' up my head
You pull the curtains back an' my mind is blown
Let's go, let's go, let's go

From the start to eternity
You are the fresh air I breathe
You will always be
The heart of my beat, the heart of my (oh)
You put the soul in my melodies
I write the songs in Your key
Yeah, You will always be
The heart of my beat, the heart of my (yeah)"
