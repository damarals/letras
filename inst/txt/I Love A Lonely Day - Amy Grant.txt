"1" "I Love A Lonely Day
Amy Grant

TV's off at 1am,
One more day alone again.
The work gets longer every day,
Why'd I have to get away?

But I have found a comfort here....
Solitude can be so dear.
Loneliness is not so blue,
When it puts my mind on You.

I love a lonely day, (I love a lonely day,)
It makes me think of You, (I love a lonely day,)
All alone, I can easily find Your love,
I love,
I love a lonely day, (I love a lonely day,)
It chases me to You, (I love a lonely day,)
It clears my heart,
Lets my very best part shine through;
It's You.

Lonely people everywhere,
Lucky, lonely, ones who care.
You've got all you need and more,
Someone to be lonely for,
Someone cries for you to hear,
Take your heart and wipe that tear,
Give them someone they can miss,
Give them love and sing them this.

I love a lonely day, (I love a lonely day)
It makes me think of You, (I love a lonely day)
All alone, I can easily find Your love,
I love,
I love a lonely day, (I love a lonely day)
It chases me to You, (I love a lonely day)
It clears my heart,
Lets my very best part shine through;
Oh, it's You.

I love a lonely day, (I love a lonely day)
It makes me think of You, (I love a lonely day)
All alone, I can easily find Your love,
I love,
I love a lonely day, (I love a lonely day)
It chases me to You.... (I love a lonely day)
