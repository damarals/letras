"1" "We Will Worship
Kutless

When days are gold and life is good
When the plans we make go as they should
Or when the sky turns dark and heartache falls
And a lonely painful season calls

We will worship with all of our hearts
We will worship all that you are
Through the best, through the worst
Jesus we choose, we will worship you

The only constant here is change
But you forever stay the same
No matter what this life holds in store
The truth remains, you are lord

We will worship with all of our hearts
We will worship all that you are
Through the best, through the worst
Jesus we choose, we will worship you

You are high and lifted up, good in all your ways
Glorious and worthy of all praise
You are high and lifted up, to you our voices raise
You're worthy of our praise

So we will worship with all of our hearts
We will worship all that you are
Through the best, through the worst
Jesus we choose

We will worship with all of our hearts
We will worship all that you are
Through the best, through the worst
Jesus we choose, we will worship you
We will worship you"
