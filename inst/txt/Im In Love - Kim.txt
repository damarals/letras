I'm in love I'm in love like this for the first time
I'm in love I'm in love with a girl like you
I'm in love I'm in love like this for the first time
I'm in love I'm in love with a boy just like you
Don't you know don't you know that you'd be mine

I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful girl
I'm in love I'm in love with a boy just like you
I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful girl
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love just like you

When I look into your eyes I see
The two of us moving to the same melody
He doesn't know it yet but he's already mine
Its just a matter of time before the sun shine
When I look into her eyes I see the two of us
Moving to the same melody
She doesn't know it yet but she's already mine
Its just a matter of time before the sun shine
Don't you know don't you know that you'd be mine

I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful girl
I'm in love I'm in love with a boy just like you
I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful girl
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love just like you
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful girl

I'm in love I'm in love with a boy just like you
I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful girl
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love just like you
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful girl
I'm in love I'm in love with a boy just like you"
