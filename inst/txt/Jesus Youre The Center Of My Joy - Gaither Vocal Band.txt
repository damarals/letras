"1" "Jesus, You're The Center Of My Joy
Gaither Vocal Band

Jesus, You're the center of my joy
All that's good and perfect comes from You
You're the heart of my contentment
Hope for all I do
Jesus, You're the center of my joy

When I've lost my direction,
You're the compass for my way
You're the fire and light
When nights are long and cold
In sadness, You're my laughter
That shatters all my fears
When I'm all alone,
Your hand is there to hold
Sweet, blessed Jesus,
You're the center of my joy
All that's good and perfect comes from You
You're the heart of my contentment,
Hope for all I do
Jesus, You're the center of my joy"
