"1" "I Will Rise (Beneath The Waters)
Hillsong United

This is my revelation
Christ Jesus crucified
Salvation through repentance
At the cross on which he died
Now hear my absolution
Forgiveness for my sin
And I sink beneath the waters
That Christ was buried in

I Will rise, I will rise
As Christ was raised to life
Now in Him, Now in him, I live

I Stand a New Creation
Baptised in Blood and fire
No fear of condemnation
By faith I'm justified

I Will rise, I will rise
As Christ was raised to life
Now in Him, Now in him, I live

I rise as You are risen
Declare Your rule and reign
My life confess Your lordship
And glorify your Name
Your word it stands eternal
Your Kingdom knows no end
Your Praise goes on forever
And on and on again

No power can stand against You
No curse assault Your throne
No one can steal Your Glory
For it is Yours alone
I stand to sing Your praises
I stand to testify
For I was dead in my sin

But now I rise, I will rise
As Christ was raised to life
Now in Him, Now in him, I live"
