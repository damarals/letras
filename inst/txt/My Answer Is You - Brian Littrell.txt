"1" "My Answer Is You
Brian Littrell

There's a world of difference
When faith is in a heart
It stands out like sunlight
When life becomes so dark
And when those around me ask me why I dare to dream
Or why I love, or why I sing

My answer is you
My answer is you
You're the hope that my heart is holding on to
Skeptics won't understand
It's strange from the world's point of view
My answer is you

They might find it incredible
To believe what I can't see
They might think it's foolish
Or even say it's weak
I wanna live my life so differently because of faith
And it causes them to question (for me to say)

My answer is you
My answer is you
You're the hope that my heart is holding on to
Skeptics won't understand
It's strange from the world's point of view
My answer is you

You're the reason I'm alive
For every good thing in my life
My answer is you

My answer is you
My answer is you
You're the hope that my heart is holding on to
Skeptics won't understand
It's strange from the world's point of view
But my answer is plain
And it's simple Lord

My answer is you (my answer is you)
My answer is you
