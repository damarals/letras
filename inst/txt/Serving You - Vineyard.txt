"1" "Serving You
Vineyard

No praise or crowd
No sound of thunder
No hero's tale
No sign or wonder
With all I've known
And left behind
I find my place
In serving You

Compared to none
No badge of honour
Forgotten some
A humbled valour
Held by Your hand
In shadow's gaze
I find my place
In serving You
Serving You"
