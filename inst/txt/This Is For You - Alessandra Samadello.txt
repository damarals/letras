"1" "This Is For You
Alessandra Samadello

I look at his hands, I look at his feet
And I can almost detail what I see
I feel the hurtful wind, I hear the women’s cry
I’m there seeing my Lord, seeing him die

The rivers of blood, the darkness around
Nature hides itself from the scene when Jesus cries
His body that aches, his lips that are dry
I’m there seeing my Lord, seeing him die

I try to hide, too much to bear
Because I know it is for me that He is there
And when I look around to the crowd
I find his eyes starring at me
For a second I can hear his spirit sing

“This is for you, and only you
I am giving everything because of you
This is for you, beloved one
Don’t turn away, this is the way
Come child come”

Then for a moment I look at the sky
It seems like all the universe is shutting down
I look at Jesus, He talks to God: “It is finished”
And He dies

“This is for you, and only you
I am giving everything because of you
This is for you, beloved one
Don’t turn away, this is the way
Come child come”

“This is for you, and only you
I am giving everything because of you
This is for you, beloved one
Don’t turn away, this is the way
Come child come
Don’t turn away, this is the way
Come child come”."
