"1" "Stare The Monster Down
Delirious

One thing I have pondered
Is how the mighty fall
I’ve sung the songs of heaven
Just to lose it all
See me falling down
See me falling down

Another day in paradise
Another day to die
The writing’s on the wall again
And the future’s asking why
Why we turned away
Why we turn away

Is there,
Is there a place in your arms of love
Strong enough
Will you carry us
Carry us through

Eighteen weeks of chemo
Six doses of hell
A family bucket of pills a day
To make my father well
Stare the monster down
Stare the monster down

Devil you’re not gonna win"
