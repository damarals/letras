Kutless

Perfect love
Came to rescue us
Holy blood
Claimed us at the cross

Now we are forgiven and free
Adopted, and chosen to be

Children of God
Lift up your voice and sing
Wherever you are
Our father is the King

We are forgiven
We are His children
All is (always) forgiven
We are the children of God

Now we wait
We are waiting for that day
We will praise
Our father face to face

Cause we are forgiven and free
Adopted, and chosen to be

How great, how great is our Father's love
He gave, He gave us His only Son"
