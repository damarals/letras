"1" "Forgiven & Loved
Jimmy Needham

Tell me I'm forgiven and loved
'Cause I hear it from the street corner priests
On how God is love and how man can be clean
But my joy has been on holiday
And my peace has almost passed away
Tell me I'm forgiven and free

Oh I tried and tried to rectify my hopeless situation
But I bought the lie I still have work to do
Now I'm working nine to five like I can earn my own salvation
But there is no condemnation in You

Oh whisper to me now that it's for real
'Cause in the silence of these walls righteousness lost its appeal
Dirty deeds have done me in
Oh but that can't stop the faithful friend
Giving mercy once again as You heal
Here it is I'm feeling it

Oh I tried and tried to rectify my hopeless situation
But I bought the lie I still have work to do
Now I'm working nine to five like I can earn my own salvation
But there is no condemnation in You

Oh He died, He died to rectify my hopeless situation
And His blood commands my guilt to leave
Now on Calvary I stand
Empty pockets, open hands
Oh there is no condemnation for me

Oh I tried and tried to rectify my hopeless situation
But I bought the lie I still have work to do
Now I'm working nine to five like I can earn my own salvation
But there is no condemnation in You

Child, you're forgiven and loved
Child, you're forgiven and loved
Child, you're forgiven
And child, you are loved
Child, you're forgiven and loved"
