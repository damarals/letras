"1" "Mary, Did You Know?
Gaither Vocal Band

Mary did you know that your baby boy
would someday walk on water?
Mary did you know that your baby boy
would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy
has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered
will soon deliver you.
Mary did you know that your baby boy
will give sight to a blind man?
Mary did you know that your baby boy
will calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know that your baby boy
has walked where angels trod?
When you've kissed your little baby
then you've kissed the face of God.

Mary, did you know...?
Mary, did you know...?
The blind will see, the deaf will hear
the dead will live a-gain
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak
the praises of the Lamb.
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
will one day rule the nations?"
