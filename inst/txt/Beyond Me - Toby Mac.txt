"1" "Beyond Me
Toby Mac

Call it a reason to retreat
I got some dreams that are bigger than me
I might be outmatched, outsized
The underdog in the fight of my life
Is it so crazy to believe

That you gave me the stars put them out of my reach
Called me to waters a little too deep
Oh, I've never been so aware of my need
You keep on making me see

It's way beyond me
It's way beyond me
Yeah, it's out of my league
It's way beyond me
It's way beyond me
It's way beyond

Anything that I got the strength to do
In over my head keeps me countin' on you
I'm leaving the sweet spot, sure shot
Tradin' it all for the plans you got
Is it so crazy to believe

You take me to the place where I know I need you
Straight to the depths that I can't handle on my own
And the lord I know, I know I need you
So take me to your great
Take me to your great unknown"
