Kutless

You're my firm foundation, you're my rock
You're my great salvation
When every hope is lost
You're my strong redeemer, you're my friend
By your blood you saved my soul

I put my trust in you
My strong deliverer
I trust in you, my god
I put my hope in you
You reign forever
My heart will rest in you

You are all I need, you gave me life
Healed my broken soul by your sacrifice
You were crucified but you're alive
Now I sing in victory

I put my trust in you
My strong deliverer
I trust in you, my God
I put my hope in you
you reign forever
My heart will rest in you

I will not fear, for you are on the throne
Through every storm, you're not letting go
You are good, you are good, god, you're so good
So I will rest in you

I put my trust in you
My strong deliverer
I trust in you, my god
I put my hope in you
You reign forever
My heart will rest in you

My heart will rest"
