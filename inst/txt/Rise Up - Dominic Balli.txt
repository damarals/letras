"1" "Rise Up
Dominic Balli

Masses crowded to see miracles by moonlight
Like the men on the roof with their friend that
night
They let him down by his bed he lay at the feet of the King
But he would not stay cuz the healer spoke as the prophets said

Chorus: Son rise up stop your dying
You’ve been sleeping so long now
Rise up no more crying
The night’s come and gone now, nights
come and gone now

Ruler by the day paranoid by night
He came while it was black for more than lack of time
His blood raced in place hope to see the face
His heart believed could change all history’s fate
Out of the shadows came the Son of Man
His words cut his heart like only fire can
As the man stand still and ill hardly breathing
Is it possible that one man holds all I’ve
been seeking
Sunlight pierced night he turned away and fled
But the words that he heard runnin through his head

Chorus: Rise up stop your dying
You’ve been sleeping so long now
Rise up no more crying
The night’s come and gone now
Give up stop Your fighting
The battle’s been won now, the conflict is done now
Stand up, just stand up, son stand
up and ride on

He came to give life to call the lost from the night
To heal the broken heart of a world that’s been scarred by the fight
He gave the lame man a dance, he brought sight to the blind
Gave the failure a chance, and the speechless a rhyme
The life is in the blood and when they took it from him
By three holes he hung and broke the burden of sin
The world stood watching, mocking all corrupted within
Said he saved other men, let’s see him do it again
Then they buried Him
The tomb sealed in hate then three day by
The clouds broke open and the heavens cried

Chorus: Son rise up no more dying
You’ve been sleeping so long now
Rise up stop their crying
The nights come and gone now
Get up, stop the fighting, the
battles been won now
Stand up just stand up

Chorus: People rise up stop your dying
You’ve been sleeping so long now, get up and live on
Rise up no more crying
The night’s come and gone now, darkness is cast out
Give up stop Your fighting
The battle’s been
won now, the conflict is done now
Stand up, stand up, just stand up"
