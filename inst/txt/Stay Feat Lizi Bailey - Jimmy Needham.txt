"1" "Stay (Feat. Lizi Bailey)
Jimmy Needham

You lead me like the dawning of the day
You lead me like april leads into may
You lead me like the stone you rolled away
You take my hand and we will run away

Just like a child I rest upon your knee
Just like a song, your love, it sings to me
Inside your arms I find a symphony
You take my hand and then we run away

To the place where my fears have no voice at all
Only sound in my ear, the whisper of your call
This moment is frozen
I'm not going anywhere
I'd linger forever
If only I could stay here

Remember all those years ago we met
All I recall are days of past regret
And you felt so far but I had never left
Just wanting you to take my hand and run

To the place where my fears have no voice at all
The only sound in my ear, the whisper of your call
This moment is frozen
I'm not going anywhere
I'd linger forever
If only I could stay
If only I could stay

In the place where my fears have no voice at all
Only sound in my ear, the whisper
In the place where my fears have no voice at all
Only sound in my ear, the whisper
This moment is frozen
I'm not going anywhere
I'd linger forever
If only I could stay
If I could stay here"
