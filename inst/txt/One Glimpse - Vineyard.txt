Vineyard

I lay down before You
For I feel so comfortable there
My heart wide open before You
Cause I know that You'll meet with me here

It's so easy to say I love You
For youve shown it to me
It's so easy to say I love You

Your arms open wide
The love shows in Your eyes
You take me as I am
Your love's torn me apart
It's gone straight to my heart
One glimpse and how can I be the same?"
