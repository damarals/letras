"1" "Jesus I Need You
Hillsong United

Hope be my anthem
Lord, when the world has fallen quiet
You stand beside me
Give me a song in the night

Jesus I need you
Every moment I need you
Hear now this grace bought heart sing out
Your praise forever

Beauty for ashes
You find the weak and contrite heart
Shoulder its burden
And carry it into light

Jesus I need you
Every moment I need you
Hear now this grace bought heart sing out
Your praise forever

Remember love, remember mercy
Christ before me, christ behind me
Your loving kindness has never failed me
Christ before me, christ behind me

Jesus I need you
Every moment I need you
Hear now this grace bought heart sing out
Your praise forever

Remember love, remember mercy
Christ before me, christ behind me
Your loving kindness has never failed me
Christ before me, christ behind me"
