Lyrics & Music by Mac Powell & Mark Lee

From the recording: Third Day, Track #9.

I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in this place
and I hope that He never leaves
I'm now without a care, It is something I can't explain
And I feel so free

Chorus:
Holy Spirit, we cry to You
Holy Spirit, in this place
Holy Spirit, give us comfort
Come down on us like a flame.

Read about Him in the Bible. He was in the men of God
And though I don't deserve it, He is in me
You can feel a new revival. Ask Jesus in your heart.
And you'll feel so free...

Repeat chorus

(Bridge) You've got to feel it, oh to believe it
You've got to see it, won't you receive it
Why don't you believe in....
"
