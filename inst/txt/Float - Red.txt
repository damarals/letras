Red

Yeah

I don't remember falling
But still I hit the ground
That was before I woke up
But let's live in the now

Can you see inside of me?
I swear to God it's like I'm fading away
It disappears right in front of me
It wasn't real, it isn't real

Fighting the fear
I am letting go, letting go
It's already here
I am letting go, letting go

I slip away to nothing
Empire crumbling
I made the heart's desire
I make the suffering

Fighting the fear
I am letting go, letting go
It's already here
I am letting go, letting go

Like you could hear the silence
The things you'll never know
Like you could feel the nothing
Like you could ever float

Fighting the fear
I am letting go, letting go
It's already here
I am letting go, letting go"
