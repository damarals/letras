Vineyard

You are God above the stars
And yet You choose to come into my heart
And in Your hands are oceans wide
And yet I feel that Your hand is in mine

And Your grace, it brings me to my knees
And it gives me eyes to see

When Your love comes down it's You I find
And it shows me how You've changed my life

You are God who fi lls the skies
And yet I feel that You're here with me now
(And) In Your hands are mountains high
How I feel love, yes I feel love"
