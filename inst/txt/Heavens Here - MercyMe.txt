MercyMe

All I knew, how the [?] goes
Tryn' to get through life
Till you get called home
Looking you
Heaven has it gone?
Eternity is now
Not when this life's done

Hallelujah, sing like the angels do
We don't have to wait 'til this life's through
No separation, [He has raised us up?]
We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us
I say, we don't have to wait, heaven's here with us

Make no mistake, trust Me I know
There's a place waiting
That we'll call home
But there ain't no hurry
Life is much sweeter
[?]
It's all been prepared

Hallelujah, sing like the angels do
We don't have to wait 'til this life's through
No separation, [He has raised us up?]
We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us
I said, we don't have to wait, heaven's here with us

We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us
We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us
I say, we don't have to wait, heaven's here with us

What are we waiting for?
If we're [?]
Together forever in Christ
[?]

Oh heaven [?]
Oh heaven [?]
Oh heaven [?]
Sing heaven [?]

Hallelujah, sing like the angels do
We don't have to wait 'til this life's through
No separation, [He has raised us up?]
We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us
I say, we don't have to wait, heaven's here with us

Heaven's here!
We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us
Heaven's here!
We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us
I said, we don't have to wait, heaven's here with us"
