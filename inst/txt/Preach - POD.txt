P.O.D.

Let it be know that you heard it from here
When I'm on this microphone you know I make myself clear
With the power, with the love with the boldness
Look in my eyes and remember who told you this
Payable on Death gonna hit ya hit-man
Talk all you want, I don't fear any man
Cuz ya frontin' ain't nothin but words to me
You never had the stuff and your butt ain't crazy enough
To handle, we come step to me
My King is He in the power of Three
So what you want you ain't down with us
You get so scared, so mad when I say the word Jesus
I ain't down, you preach too much
But if you ask me boy, I don't think I preach enough
I tell you God is real, so don't miss the boat
But since we come off hard, you say we shove it down your throats
You wanna talk that talk, walk that walk
I'm the only person you see, but it ain't me that you mock
Man is nothing, but you think that you're bad
Fool if it wasn't for my God, I would have already had you
Deny His name are you willing to admit it
And if so, are you willing to die for it
Cuz I am, He is my life and I don't fear death
Cuz he already paid the Price
All your talk and all your threats ain't jack blaspheme my God
Yo punk I'm not having that, turn away it's your own loss
Cuz all I can do is just take them to the cross
