Kutless

Who ever told you you can't win
Who ever said that if you fail don't try again
It's in the ordinary
Deep in the weak and weary
The power to overcome the fear you're holding in

You could be a hero
You could be the change in this world
Rise above the normal
Don't have to be afraid any more
We are the light we are the hope
We are the love inside worth fighting for
You could be, you could be, you could be a hero

You don't have to look that hard to see
You don't have to reach that far to find someone in need
There is a desperation deep in this generation
Looking for something new a love they can believe

Love will even cross the ocean wide
Love will lose it all to save a life
Because of the love god gave you'll find
That you could be hero"
