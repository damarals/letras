"1" "Hallellujah For The Cross
Newsboys

Up to the hill of calvary
My savior went courageously
And there he bled, and died for me
Hallellujah for the cross
And on that day the world was changed
A final perfect, lamb was slain
Let earth and heaven now proclaim
Hallellujah for the cross

Hallelujah
For the war he fought
Love has won
Death has lost
Hallelujah for the souls he bought
Hallellujah for the cross

What could I have done
Could never save
My debt too great for deeds to pay
But God my savior made a way
Hallellujah for the cross

A slave to sin my life was bound
But all my chains feel to the ground
When Jesus' blood came flowing down
Hallellujah for the cross

Hallelujah
For the war he fought
Love has won
Death has lost
Hallelujah for the souls he bought
Hallellujah for the cross

Hallellujah, hallellujah
And when I breathe my final breathe
I'll have no need to fear the rest
This hope will guide me into death
Hallellujah for the cross

Hallelujah
For the war he fought
Love has won
Death has lost
Hallelujah for the souls he bought
Hallellujah for the cross
Hallellujah for the cross"
