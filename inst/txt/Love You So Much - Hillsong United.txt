"1" "Love You So Much
Hillsong United

Hear these praises from a grateful heart
Each time I think of you
The praises start
Love you so much
Jesus, love you so much.

Lord, I love you
My soul sings in you presence
Carried on your wings,
Love you so much
Jesus, love you so much.

How my soul longs for you
Longs to worship you forever
In your power and majesty.
Lift my hands, lift my heart
Lift my voice towards the heaven
For you are my sun and shield."
