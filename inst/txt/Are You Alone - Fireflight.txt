"1" "Are You Alone?
Fireflight

I was so lonely then.
No one was my friend.
My ears were clogged
and it was so quiet.

Are you walking there?
(You are here beside me)
Am I all alone?
(I am)

(Are you alone?)
So I climb out of the darkness
(Are you alone?)
and I rise up from the midst
(I'm not alone)
and Lord You take my hand.

God's love surrounds me now.
It's in my lungs, I breathe it out.
It makes everything right
and I am whole again.

You hold my hand so tight
that it spills your blood.
All that I've done wrong
Your love makes it right"
