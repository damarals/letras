This I Pray

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray The Lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I pray The Lord my soul to take

Forgive me Lord for I have sinned
Have mercy on the shape I'm in
And if I've fallen from Your grace
Help me Lord to find my place

I'm in a storm with no way out
The waters rough
I'm tossed about
I know that there's blue sky above
It's in Your mercy and Your love

(Chorus)
I swear I won't go down
Without a fight
The darkest night
Will always lead to light
Take my hand
And help me find my way
I don't wanna die
Just give me one more day
This I Pray

I crossed a bridge
And lost my way
For years and years
I've gone astray
And if I live another day
I pray the Lord to guide my way

I need a savior
Here and now
I know I'm sinking
Yet somehow
I'm reaching for some final peace
Before my time begins to cease

(Chorus)
I swear I won't go down
Without a fight
The darkest night
Will always lead to light
Take my hand
And help me find my way
I don't wanna die
Just give me one more day
This I Pray

Now I lay me down to sleep
I Pray The Lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I pray The Lord my soul to take"
