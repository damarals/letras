"1" "Not My Will But Thine
Youthful Praise

Jesus prayed in the garden and poured out His heart for me
There has been no love shown my mortal as in dark Gethsemane
He could have chosen not to suffer treatment of the cruelest kind
But the lips of my pure Savior uttered not my will but thine.
Part Ia-
Jesus prayed in the Garden, he prayed oh (repeated)
Part Ib-
Let me tell you what he went through
You know he really didn't have to
He could have easily just walked away
Then he said \"not my will but thine\"
And they took them and they beat him and they mocked him and teased him
The people kept a cryin \"We gotta crucify Him\"
\"Crucify Him! Crucify Him!\"
Yet he said \"not my will but thine\"
Part IIa-
Jesus died on Calvary, he died oh (repeated)
Part IIb-
Well they hung him there in anger searchin' for some relief
They nailed him there in public right between the two thiefs
He tasted human torture of the cruelest kind
But yet he said \"not my will but thine\"
Some were laughin', some were cryin' some were happy at his dyin'
I don't see, I can't see how could this ever be?
Poor Jesus as he hung on the tree he said
\"Not my will but thine\"
Not my will but thine"
