Take 6

How sweet is to be love by You
How sweet is to be love by You

I need the shelter of someone's arms
And there You were
I needed someone to help me through my ups and downs
And there You were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I just have to stop and thank my Jesus
I just have to stop and thank my Jesus

How sweet is to be love by You
How sweet is to be love by You

I close my eyes late at night
Wondering where would I be without You in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere that I went I felt I had been there before
But You brightened up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I have to stop and thank my Jesus
I just have to stop and thank my Jesus

How sweet is to be love by You
How sweet is to be love by You"
