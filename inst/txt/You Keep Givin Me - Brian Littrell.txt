You Keep Givin' Me

So many reasons to be thankful
and so many blessings that I can’t repay
and I never would have made it here without You
Sending Angels that guide me on my way

You keep givin' me joy
You keep givin' me happiness
You keep givin' me hope
You keep givin' me everything I wish
You keep holding me up
when I’m about to fall
And if even all of that was not enough
You keep givin' me love (you keep givin' me love)

I know that I’m not always easy
and I know I put You through some trying days
But in spite of all the worries that I gave You
no, you never let my Angels get away

You keep givin' me joy
You keep givin' me happiness
You keep givin' me hope
You keep givin' me everything I wish
You keep holding me up
when I’m about to fall
And if even all of that was not enough
You keep givin' me love

And have I told you lately (have I told ya)
How your love has saved me?
It takes me to a place I only dreamed
I’m so thankful lord for sending me angels

You keep givin' me joy
you keep givin' me happiness
you keep givin' me hope
you keep givin' me everything I wish (everything I wish)
you keep holding me up
when I’m about to fall
and if even all of that was not enough

You keep givin' me joy
You keep givin' me happiness
You keep givin' me hope
You keep givin' me everything I wish
You keep holding me up
when I’m about to fall
And if even all of that was not enough
You send angels to guide me from up above
You just keep givin' me
You just keep givin' me love

You givin', you givin', you givin' me
How can I thank you
You givin', you givin', you givin' me
How can I thank you
You givin', you givin' you, givin' me
Oh freely you do
(You givin' you givin' you givin' me)
How can I thank you lord
(You givin' you givin' you givin' me)
For how much you blessed me with everything

You keep givin' me love
You keep givin' me (You keep givin' me love)
Givin' me love
You keep givin' love
You keep givin' love
You keep givin' love
You keep givin' love
So I am amazed

You givin', you givin', you givin' me (you)
You givin', you givin', you givin' me (you givin' me love)
You givin', you givin,' you givin' me
You givin', you givin', you givin' me
