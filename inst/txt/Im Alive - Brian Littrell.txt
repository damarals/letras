"1" "I'm Alive
Brian Littrell

I lived a lot a life
I caught a dream or two
It's been a sweet ride
But I've faced my share of nights
Searched like we all do
Looking inside
Now I'm standing here
'Cause you've made it clear

This heart inside me beats because
You loved enough to take my cross
I'm alive
You gave your life to shatter death
So even after my last breath
I'm alive

I'm finally wide awake
I'm finished being known
It's a new day
But I feel it on my face
In hope's a midnight sun
That won't fade away
I'm bowing down
And I'm crying out

This heart inside me beats because
You loved enough to take my cross
I'm alive
You gave your life to shatter death
So even after my last breath
I'm alive

Forever forever more
Forever Lord

I'm alive

Forever forever more
Forever Lord

This heart inside me beats because
You loved enough to take my cross
I'm alive
You gave your life to shatter death
So even after my last breath
I'm alive

Forever forever more
forever Lord
Forever forever more
forever Lord"
