"1" "We Are Running
Hillsong United

Ready at the line looking out
Looking out to all that’s ahead
When ever heart
Confesses Your name
We’re pressing on towards that day

We’re never gonna stop
We’re never gonna stop

Letting go of every mistake
Throwing off the chains of restraint
All that will remain
A passion for Your name
Running as we run this race

We are running
Chasing after all that You are
We are running
‘Cause all that you are
Is all that we want now

Every stride is taken in faith
Every step compelled by Your grace
We’re taking up our cross
No matter what the cost
We give al to go Your way

After all is said and done
After every race is run
We will be forever
Resting in Your love
When our finish line has come
And al creation stands as one
We will be forever
Resting in Your love"
