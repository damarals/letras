"1" "Take It All
Youthful Praise

Searching the world
The lost will be found
In freedom we live
As one we cry out
You carry the cross
You died and rose again
My God I'll only ever give my all
You sent Your Son
From Heaven to earth
Delivered us all
It's eternally heard
I searched for truth
And all I found was You
My God I'll only ever give my all
Jesus we're living Your Name
We'll never be ashamed of You
Whoa O oh
In our praise
In all we are today
Take, take, take it all
Take, take, take, it all
Running to the One who heals the blind
Following the shining light
In Your hands the power to save the world
My life"
