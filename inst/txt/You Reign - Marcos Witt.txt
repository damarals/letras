"1" "You Reign
Marcos Witt

(chorus)
You reign, hosanna
You reign, hallelujah

Lord Your majesty surrounds me
I surrender to Your glory
There's a joy that's everlasting
It's filling my heart
And giving me strength

You've changed my mourning into dancing
You have showered me with blessings
There's a song of great rejoicing
That's filling my heart
And filling this place

(bridge)
In Your presence
There is singing
There is dancing, rejoicing
And highest praise

There is no one
Throughout the ages
Who is as worthy to be magnified"
