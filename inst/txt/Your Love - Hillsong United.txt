Verse:
Jesus, Your loving kindness
I'm so blessed by all that You've done
The life that You give
Jesus, Your loving kindness
Is life that's changing my heart
Drawing me near to You

Chorus:
Your love is better than life
I know it well
And I'll find all that I need
In You, In You
Your love is better than life
I know it well
And I'll find all that I need in You"
