"1" "At All Times
Vineyard

In the mountains of joy, in the valley of tears
I will love You, I will trust You

When the flame’s burning bright, when I’m weary and dry
I will love You, I will trust You

You are my strength and You are my song
Giving me hope and guiding me on

At all times I will sing of Your greatness
At all times I will sing of Your love

At all times I will sing of Your faithfulness
For Your goodness remains

And Your love is the same
At all times

When your guidance is clear, when I can’t see ahead
I will love You, I will trust You

In the summer of life, in the soul’s darkest night
I will love You, I will trust You

You are my strength and You are my song,
Giving me hope and guiding me on"
