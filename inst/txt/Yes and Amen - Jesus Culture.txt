Jesus Culture

Father of kindness
You have poured out grace
You brought me out of darkness
You have filled me with peace
Giver of mercy
You're my help in time of need
Lord, I can't help but sing

Faithful, You are
Faithful, forever, You will be
Faithful, You are
All Your promises are yes and amen
All Your promises are yes and amen

Beautiful Savior
You have brought me near
You pulled me from the ashes
You have broken every curse
Blessed Redeemer
You have set this captive free
Lord, I can't help but sing

I will rest in Your promises
My confidence is Your faithfulness"
