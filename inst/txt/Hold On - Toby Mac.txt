Toby Mac

Wake up to the morning light
Wipe away the lonely nights
Let a brand new day wash over you
Wanna see you smile again
Show some love to your crazy friends
Wipe your tears away, those days are through
If you move just a little bit closer
You can put your head on my shoulder
Yeah, yeah
So baby hold on
Just another day or two
I can see the clouds are moving faster now
And the sun is breaking through
If you could hold on
To the One that’s holding you
There is nothing that can stop this crazy love
From breaking through, we’re breaking through
Wake up to the rising sun
Thank the Lord for the things He’s done
Lift your eyes to the hope that’s ever true
Wanna see you smiling girl
You’re a light in this jaded world
Wipe away those tears
This one’s for you
And the stars are up there shining for you
Oh, how the Father does adore you
His love will never change
And you and I, we were born to follow
The hope that will lead us to tomorrow
And no one can take it away"
