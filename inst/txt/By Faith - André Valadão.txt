"1" "By Faith
André Valadão

By faith I can see
By faith I can reach
By faith I can live
By faith
By faith

There is no higher mountain
that can stand before my prayer
In Christ I found all the strength to overcome

By faith I can be heal
By faith I can be anointed
By faith I can be restored
By faith
By faith

There is no higher mountain
that can stand before my prayer
In Christ I found all the strength to overcome

By faith"
