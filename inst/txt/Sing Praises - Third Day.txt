Lyrics by Mac Powell/Music by Third Day
From the recording: Come Together, Track #11.

Sing praises to our God, sing praises
Sing praises to our King, sing praises
Let all the nations sing
Let all the nations sing of His love
Oh, sing praises

So shout for joy all of His children
So shout for joy all of His children
Let all the people sing
Let all the people sing of His love
Oh, sing praises

For You are God and You are worthy
Of all our lives and all our praise
And so we sing to the Most Holy
The Lord, our God
The Lord, our King

Sing praises to our God, sing praises
Sing praises to our King, sing praises
For He alone is God
For He alone is worthy of praise
Oh, sing praises
"
