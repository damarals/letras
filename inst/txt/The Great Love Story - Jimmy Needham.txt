"1" "The Great Love Story
Jimmy Needham

Where do you hide
Where do you go?
Why are you running from me?
And why do you fear when you know I am near to Thee
Someone come
Someone come
Someone come fill the divide
Fill the divide
Colorless life, not even grey
Oceans apart and miles and miles away
O, being deceived and deceiving the same
Jesus come
Jesus come
Jesus come fill the divide
Who will save me from this death
Who will save me from this death
Who will save me from this death
Who will raise me from the dead
Who will save me, who will save?
Jesus won
Jesus won
Jesus won, filled the divide
Jesus won
Jesus won
Jesus won, filled the divide
All glory
All honor be
To the God that filled the divide"
