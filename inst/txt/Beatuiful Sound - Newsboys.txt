\"Turn the page
Can't turn the light out
Every word every line
Carries to my soul
Dark letters on a page
Singing so loud
Where did I go wrong
not to hear You.....

Eighteen years
I guess it was alright
I let You do the thinking
I'd just rather bide my time
Father to son
Sunday hand me down
Where did I go wrong
Not to hear Your song

It's a beautiful sound
Moving through the crowd
Voices lifted up
On high for You

It's a beautiful song
And we've only just begun to understand
Rediscovering You

To have found You , and still be looking for You
Is \"The soul's paradox of love\"
I won't stop now that I'm free
I'll be chasing You
Like You chase me

Lead us break us
Form us make us
Mold us bend us
Push us shape us
This is poetry in motion
Mercies new everyday
This faith cannot stay still
Until we see You face to face\"
