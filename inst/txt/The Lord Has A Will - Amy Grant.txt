"1" "The Lord Has A Will
Amy Grant

I need you Lord; in all I do.
You're always there to see me through.
I can't get by unless I lean on you, Lord.

The Lord has a will,
And I have a need
To follow that will,
To humbly be still,
To rest in it,
Nest in it,
Fully be blessed in it,
Following my Father's will.

Your love, Lord, is in my heart.
You wrote it there; it won't depart.
It lights my way and keeps me out of the dark.

The Lord has a will,
And I have a need
To follow that will,
To humbly be still,
To rest in it,
Nest in it,
Fully be blessed in it,
Following my Father's will.

I thank you, Lord, Your Word is sown
Into my life, and there it's grown;
It's roots go deep where living waters are known.

The Lord has a will,
And I have a need
To follow that will,
To humbly be still,
To rest in it,
Nest in it,
Fully be blessed in it,
Following my Father's will.

The Lord has a will,
And I have a need
To follow that will,
To humbly be still,
To rest in it,
Nest in it,
Fully be blessed in it,
Following my Father's will.

To rest in it,
Nest in it,
Fully be blessed in it,
Following my Father's will.
