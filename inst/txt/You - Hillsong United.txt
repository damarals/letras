Hillsong United

As I pray and wait upon the Lord
I know Your grace and love I am restored
As I think of all You've done for me
The mystery of Your love

Who walked upon the sea
Who lived to die for me
You Lord, You Lord
You are Lord

As I look upon You I am changed
And though I fail, Your faithful love remains
As I sing and worship You
I find again no words describe Your love

Who watches over me
Whose love has covered me
You Lord, You Lord
You are Lord

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Almighty One
There is none like You"
