"1" "Just A Closer Walk With Thee
Músicas Gospel

Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea.
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

I am weak, but Thou art strong
Jesus, keep me from all wrong.
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk let me walk close to Thee

In this world of toil and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who but Thee my burden shares?
None but Thee, oh Lord, none but Thee.

When my feeble life is oÃ¢Â€Â™er
Time for me will be more no more
Guide me gently, safely oÃ¢Â€Â™er
To Thy kingdom shore to Thy shore

When my weary life is o'er
Pain and suff'ring are no more.
Who will lead me safely o'er
Canaan's shore,
That sweet Canaan's shore."
