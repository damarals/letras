Kirk Franklin

Kirk:
Wow
It's your boy
Let's go
This is a tribute right here
And it is about
To go
Down

Coral:
Do you remember, the twenty-first night of september?
Before you grew cold like december,
and all you saw was a cloudy day.

Do you remember, that day when you surrender?
You start turning cuz you remember;
The season it won't last away.

Ba de ya, tell me you remember.
Ba de ya, and your heart feels like september
You still had the joy, n'God was just a prayer away.

ba doo doop ba doop, ba doo doop ba doop
(I can see clearly now)
ba doo doop ba doop, ba doo doop ba doop
(the sun is much brighter now)
ba doo doop ba doop, ba doo doop ba doop
(the season it wont last away)

Sing like forever
You said when will my life gets better.
I'm tired of storm and this weather,
But the sun is always shine in day.

So just remember,
The next time you fell like december
Remember the night in september,
When God wiped all ur tears away.

Ba de ya, tell me you remember.
Ba de ya, and your heart feels like september
You still had the joy, n'God was just a prayer away.

[Oração]
Everybody has a september in their life.
You know the first time you heart God's voice
So you felt His love
So no mather what season you end up right now
That could winter comes springs..
So if you love my Jesus help me sing

Ba de ya, tell me you remember.
Ba de ya, and your heart feels like september
You still had the joy, n'God was just a prayer away."
