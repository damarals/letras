That's How You Change The World

All my life I had big dreams
To do big things and make a change
And all the while I just passed by the simple needs
Right here next to me
'Cause there's a breaking heart
That's falling apart and tear-filled eyes
Looking back at me
God, won't you help me to see

It's a prayer in an empty room
Little things we do when nobody's around
A hand reaching out
To a heart in doubt
It's the smallest spark
That can light the dark

That's how you change the world

A million little drops of rain
Can be enough to cause a tidal wave
A flood of your love that no one can contain
'cause there's an empty soul that wants to be known
Around me now that I can lead to you
Revealing love that won't refuse

It's a prayer in an empty room
Little things we do when nobody's around
A hand reaching out
To a heart in doubt
It's the smallest spark
That can light the dark

It's the kind words
A simple smile
More than showing up
Going the extra mile
It's giving everything
When you've got nothing left
Sharing a little hope
With a single breath

That's how you change the world

It's a prayer in an empty room
A hand reaching out
It's a prayer in an empty room
Little things we do when nobody's around
A hand reaching out
To a heart in doubt
It's the smallest spark
That can light the dark

That's how you change the world"
