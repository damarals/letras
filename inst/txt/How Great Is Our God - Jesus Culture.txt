Jesus Culture

Verse 1:
The splendor of the king clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice all the earth rejoice
He wraps himself in light and darkness tries to hide
And tremble at his voice and trembles at his voice

Chorus:
How great is our God sing with me How great is our God
And all will see how great and how great is our God

Verse 2:
Age to age he stands and time in his hands
Beginning and the end beginning and the end
The God head three in one Father spirit son
The lion and the lamb the lion and the lamb

Coda:
Name above all names you are worthy of all praise
My heart will sing how great is our God"
