"1" "Shall We Gather At The River
MÃºsicas Gospel

Chorus:

Yes we'll gather at the river
The beautiful, beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the Throne of God

Shall we gather at the river
Where bright angel feet have trod
With it's crystal tide forever
Flowing by the throne of God

repeat chorus

On the margin of the river
Washing up its silver spray
We shall walk and worship ever
All the happy golden day
(refrain)

E're we reach the shining river
Lay we every burden down
Grace our spirits will deliver
And provide a robe and crown

repeat chorus

Soon we'll reach the shining river
Soon our pilgrimage will cease
Soon our happy heart will quiver
With the melody of peace

Repeat chorus"
