"1" "An Empty Mansion
MÃºsicas Gospel

Here I labor and toil as I look for a home
Just a humble abode among men
While in Heaven a mansion is waiting for me
And a gentle Voice pleading, Come in.

(Chorus)
There's a mansion now empty just waiting for me
At the end of life's trouble some way
Many friends and dear loved ones will welcome me There
Near the door of that mansion someday

Ever thankful am I that my Savior and Lord
Promised unto the weary sweet rest
Nothing more could I ask than a mansion above
There to live with saved and the blessed

(Repeat Chorus)

When my labor and toiling have ended below
And my hands shall lie folded in rest
I'll exchange this old home for a mansion up There
And invite the archangel as guest

(Repeat Chorus)"
