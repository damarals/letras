"1" "Beautiful Affection
Vineyard

I marvel at Your love
As I rest between Your shoulders
Your beautiful affection for my life
As You look into my soul
And see past these imperfections
And still You call me worthy of Your love

You're truth, Oh Lord
I love that about you and here in this place
With my hands raised
Let me say that I love you
Yes I do"
