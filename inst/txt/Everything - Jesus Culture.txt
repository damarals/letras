Verse 1:
Find me here
Speak to me
I want to feel you
I need to hear you
You are the light
That?s leading me
To the place
Where I find peace again

Verse 2:
You are the strength
That keeps me walking
You are the hope
That keeps me trusting
You are the life
To my soul
You are my purpose
You?re everything

Chorus:
And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you
Would you tell me how could it be any better than
this

Verse 3:
You calm the storms
You give me rest
You hold me in your hands
You won?t let me fall
You steal my heart
You take my breath away
Take me in
Take me deeper now

Bridge:
Cause you?re all I want, You?re all I need
Everything, everything"
