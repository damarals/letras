"1" "We Remember
Jeremy Camp

We worship you, Lord in the splendor of your holiness
In the beauty of your righteousness, holy, holy
We offer you thanks, for the endless love you have displayed
For the sacrifice you freely gave, worthy, worthy

[chorus]

You are holy, precious lamb of God
Forever you will reign, forever you will reign
King of glory, risen son of God
Forever you will reign, forever you will reign

Father of light, your radiance and majesty
Set your son to set the captive free, holy, holy
Infinite love on the cross, you saved us from our sins
Conquered death and returned again, worthy, worthy

[chorus]

We remember, we remember the cross"
