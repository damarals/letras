"1" "Road Trip
Kirk Franklin

One, two, three

Pack a smile, cause this road won't be easy
Doubt will come, believe me
Sometimes you'll wonder if it's alright
Hold on tight, it's about to be amazing
When you see what God is making
I can't wait for you to tell me that (it's alright)

Travel light and leave room for tomorrow, expect delays
And sorrow, avoid left turns, don't forget what's right
Pray always, listen to that voice above you
Only let folk ride that love you, see you've come too far
You've gotta wrap on tight

But every time that you've been through
For His glory God is using you
See it's only in the darkest night
That you really see the stars shine bright

So pack a smile, cause this road won't be easy
Doubt will come, believe me
Sometimes you'll wonder if it's alright
Hold on tight, it's about to be amazing
When you see what God is making
I can't wait for you to tell me that (it's alright)

See I know, dreams can take forever
Especially in stormy weather
It's hard to see where the road will end
But good news, your destination is determined
It's selected and predestined
Ain't it good to know you win before you begin?

But every time that you've been through
For His glory God is using you
See it's only in the darkest night
That you really see the stars shine bright

So pack a smile, cause this road won't be easy
Doubt will come, believe me
Sometimes you'll wonder if it's alright
Hold on tight, it's about to be amazing
When you see what God is making
I can't wait for you to tell me that (it's alright)

It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

The rear view mirror is smaller
Because when you can
You're only supposed to look back at it real quick
Cause where you're going is a lot greater

Get tired of runnin', but it's alright
Cause I see what's comin, and it's alright
Wanted to give up, some days I tried
But your hand wouldn't let me, now I'm alright"
