"1" "Hey Now
Toby Mac

Hey now, I feel a new one comin' on
So that you can sing along with it
Right now and I'm gonna dedicate this song
To everyone of God's children
Hey now, one love, one God out of many his people
Right now it's been a long time comin'
But I'm serving up the sequel

Back from the day, I'm the sleeper done slumbering
Pass me the mic and I might stop mumbling
Crumble like a cracker, I'll fall like a leaf
But the hole in my soul's been filled underneath
So whether you're a loser or a winner by the numbers
Everyone knows a tie goes to the runner
So lace up your shox, get yourself in this race
Cause this little thing here gonna set a new pace

Sometimes we do it like this, sometimes we do it like that
Sometimes we say it with words so you can see where we at
And on a different level I persist
To reach a girl or any fella
I believe we receive a little then we all do better
Hey now, help is coming anyday now
Hope it can reach me when I am way down
One love, one God and I'm ok now
Ten years, TOBYMAC and GRITS stay down

What you think of this here, gotta get with this here
Diverse City, are you gonna get it this year?
What you think of this here, gotta get with this here
Diverse City and we'll run it till He gets here

Get your back up off the wall
Live a little, come on
Get your back up off the wall
Everybody come on

One love, one God,
I feel a new one comin' on
So that you can sing along with it
One love, one God,
And I'm gonna dedicate this song
To everyone of God's children
One love, one God,
one love, one God out of many his people
One love, one God,
it's been a long time comin' but I'm serving up the sequel
One love, one God"
