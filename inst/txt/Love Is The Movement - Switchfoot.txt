"1" "Love Is The Movement
Switchfoot

A day in La
And millions of faces
Are looking for movement
'Cause everything's stuck
And everything's frozen
And everyone's broken
And nobody moves
And everyone's scared
That the motion will never come

This is the incompletion
Stuck in a line

Love is the movement
Love is a revolution
This is redemption
We don't have to slow back down

The stars are alive
They dance to the music
Of the deepest emotion
And all of the world
Is singing in time
As the heavens are caving in
Mysterious ways
Why God gave his life
To put motion inside my soul

It's bigger than cold religion
It's bigger than life

We're starting now
We don't have to slow back down

This is a revolution

Get up, get up
Love is moving you now"
