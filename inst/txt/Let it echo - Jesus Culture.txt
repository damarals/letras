Jesus Culture

We've only scratched the surface
And only had just one glance
We've tasted of Your glory
But there's so much more

We're standing on horizons
Where earth collides with heaven
You're longing for Your children
To cry out for more
We cry out for more

Let it echo from this city
To the nations the sound of praise
Let the windows of the heavens
Open wide and let it rain

Here in side Your presence
Surrounded by Your Spirit
We're satisfied but desperate
For even more of You, even more of You

Oh-oh
Let heaven fall
As we sing

Oh-oh
Let heaven fall
Let heaven fall"
