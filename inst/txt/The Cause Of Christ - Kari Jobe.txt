"1" "The Cause Of Christ
Kari Jobe

The only thing I want in life
Is to be known for loving christ
To build his church, to love his bride
And make his name known far and wide

For this cause I live
For this cause I'd die
I surrender all
For the cause of christ
All I once held dear
I will leave behind
For my joy is this
Oh the cause of christ

He is all my soul will prize
Regardless of the joy or trial
When agonizing questions rise
In Jesus all my hope abides

For this cause I live
For this cause I'd die
I surrender all
For the cause of christ
All I once held dear
I will leave behind
For my joy is this
Oh the cause of christ

Jesus my Jesus
For your glory for your name
Jesus my Jesus
I will only sing your praise

For this cause I live
For this cause I'd die
I surrender all
For the cause of christ
All I once held dear
I will leave behind
For my joy is this
Oh the cause of christ

It is not fame that I desire
Nor stature in my brother's eye
I pray it's said about my life
That I lived more to build
Your name than mine"
