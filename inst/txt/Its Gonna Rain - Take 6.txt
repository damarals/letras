"1" "It's Gonna Rain
Take 6

Way back in the bible days
Noah told the people that it's gonna rain
When he told them they paid him no mind
And when the rains came they were left behind

Chorus:
It' gonna rain, it's gonna rain
You better get ready and bear this in mind
God showed Noah showed him the rainbow sign
Said it won't be water but fire (fire next time)

After the rain began to pour
They knocked on the windows you know
That they knocked on the doors
The people didn't know exactly what to do
You don't want this to happen to you

Chorus

Noah said I'm sorry my friend
But God's got the key and you can't get in (so sorry)
If something don't happen to the very hearts of men
Don't you know that the same, same
Thing is gonna happen again

Chorus"
