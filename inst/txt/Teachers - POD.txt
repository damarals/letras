P.O.D.

Lock it down, and overthrow all the pilots
Then get out of town, can you see him smiling
Whispers, these bones are breaking
Whispers, all of them screaming
And we suffer this moment until the day is coming
That we reign forever!

Still I man is coming and we are the Teachers
We been through the fire cause we're pioneers
The soul of the lion, Jah love for the bleeding
Warrior soldiers, we still believe you!

Crawling through poison I lay
My soul still flies with broken wings
and the sun is blinding, I can't stop staring
I don't wanna close my eyes
Righteous respects, it's the best kept secret
I can let go of my burdens that keep me from living
so I can start dying

Still I man is coming and we are the Teachers
We been through the fire cause we're pioneers
The soul of the lion, Jah love for the bleeding
Warrior soldiers, we still believe you!

Warriors Warriors
Jah love for the bleeding
Jah Soldiers Jah Soldiers
We still believe you

Lock it down, Voice of, Pilots
Broken, Whispers, Secrets,
Suffer, Forever

Still I man is coming and we are the Teachers
We been through the fire cause we're pioneers
The soul of the lion, Jah love for the bleeding
Warrior soldiers, we still believe you!
we still believe you!
We still believe
We still believe
We still believe!
Believe!
Believe!"
