"1" "Dreams Within The Still Of Night
Michael W. Smith

On wings of hope take flight inside of me
There upon some distant shore
We want for nothing more than what will be
And you and i, here we are
I wonde as we come this far...
If i could only read your mind
Tell me the answer i would find
Do you dream of me?
And whe you're smiling your sleep
Beyound the promises we keep
Do you dream of me?
Love has found a magic space
A deep and hidden place where time stands still
Now i hold you in my arms
You know you hold my heart and always will
And you and i, here we are
And it's a wonder that we've come this far
And after all that we've been through
You've leaned on me, I've leaned on you
Do you dream of me?
And whe you're smiling your sleep
Beyound the promises we keep
Do you dream of me?
(instrumental)
If i could only read your mind
Tell me the answer i would find
Do you dream of me?
And whe you're smiling your sleep
Beyound the promises we keep
Do you dream of me?
And after all that we've been through
You've leaned on me, I've leaned on you
Do you dream of me"
