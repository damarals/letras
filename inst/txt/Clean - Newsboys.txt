I've been hidin'
Behind the walls I built to hide my insecurity
I've been pretendin'
To be the person everybody wants me to be

I can't go on livin' a lie
When I know I'm broken on the inside

God, You're strong when I am weak
I need Your grace to help me to see
That I'm not longer a slave to me
I've been washed, I've been set free

You make me clean
Better than new
God, You do
You make me clean
I know it's thе truth
Only You
You make me clean

\"Stand tall, \" thеy say
Don't let the world around you see your need to be saved
Make your own truth (Own truth)
Just live your life in any way that feels good to you

I can't go on livin' like this
'Cause I know who the healer of the story is

God, You're strong when I am weak
I need Your grace to help me to see
That I'm not longer a slave to me
I've been washed, I've been set free

You make me clean
Better than new (Better than new)
God, You do (God, You do)
You make me clean
I know it's the truth
Only You
You make me clean

I can feel the walls are comin' down
I can feel Your grace workin' on me
I can feel the chains are breakin' now
I can feel Your spirit move in me
I can see the light is breakin' through
I can feel Your mercy changing me
I can see the old has been made new
Only by Your Spirit

God, You're strong when I am weak
I need Your grace to help me to see
That I'm not longer a slave to me
I've been washed, I've been set free

You make me clean
Better than new (Better than new)
God, You do (God, You do)
You make me clean (Oh)
I know it's the truth (I know it's the truth)
Only You (God, You do)
You make me clean

You make me clean (You do)
You make me brand new (Uh-huh-uh)
You make me clean
You make me clean
You make me clean (You do)
You make me brand new
You make me clean
You make me clean"
