Hillsong United

Gloriously
You saved me, you saved, me
So miraculously
You made me brand new
You welcomed me
With open arms, open arms
Unfailingly
Your love is a river, so

I will praise you
I will praise you

I'll praise your name forever and a day
And I'll live for you into eternity
I'll praise your name forever and a day
And I'll live what I sing, what I say
What I'm learning every day

Generously
You gave me, you gave me
Marvelously
You made me, you made me
Relentlessly
I'll follow, I'll follow
Your majesty
Breathtaking, so beautiful"
