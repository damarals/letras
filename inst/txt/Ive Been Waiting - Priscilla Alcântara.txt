"1" "I've Been Waiting
Priscilla Alc√¢ntara

I've been waiting for you Lord
Come at me tonight
You are my hope in the darkest night
Light up my way with your fire

Your Glory come to shake me
You are my hope in the darkest night
Light up my way with your fire

I can't live Without you here oh please
Let me hear your voice inside of me
You and me together, forever and ever

I've been waiting for a long time to see you
Everyday I missed you so bad
Now you are here and I can see you by my side
I'll never let you go
Oh no
Oh no"
