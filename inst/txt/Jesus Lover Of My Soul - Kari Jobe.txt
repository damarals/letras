"1" "Jesus, Lover Of My Soul
Kari Jobe

Jesus, lover of my soul
All consuming fire is in Your gaze
Jesus, I want You to know
that I will follow You all of my days
No one else in history is like You
And history itself belongs to You
Oh Alpha and Omega you have loved me
And I will spend Eternity with You

It's all about You Jesus
and all this is for You
For your Glory and Your fame
It's not about me
As if You should do things my way

You alone are God and I surrender
You alone are God
You alone are God and I surrender
You alone You alone
You alone are God and I surrender
to Your ways"
