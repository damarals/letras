"1" "Colors Of His Love
Alessandra Samadello

What makes the colors of the rainbow?
Who shapes the rainbow in the sky?
And what can be more mysterious
Then all the colors hanging side by side?

They are so different yet so perfect
They show God’s vision to the universe
In the middle of the darkest rain
They point us to his grace
God has made us different yet we’re all the same

The love of God is all the colors
All the colors in the sky
Red, yellow, blue, they make the rainbow shine
The love of God is all the colors
All the colors we can see
United as the rainbow we can be
The colors of his love

We are a part of God’s big rainbow
A sign of mercy and delight
In sober individually
Each and every color shows his light

We see the love of God in colors
In every moment of our lives
It really doesn’t matter if
We’re yellow, white or black
God has made us part of his eternal plan

The love of God is all the colors
All the colors in the sky
Red, yellow, blue, they make the rainbow shine
The love of God is all the colors
All the colors we can see
United as the rainbow we can be
The colors of his love

All the way, coming from the sky
Each and every color show his light
Can we all cross the broken bridge
Turning down our prejudice and fear?

The love of God is all the colors
All the colors in the sky
Red, yellow, blue, they make the rainbow shine
The love of God is all the colors
All the colors we can see
United as the rainbow we can be
The colors of his love
The colors of his love."
