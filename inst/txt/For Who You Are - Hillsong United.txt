"1" "For Who You Are
Hillsong United

Standing here In your presence
Thinking of the good things you have done
Waiting here, Patiently Just to hear the still small voice again

Holy righteous Faithful til the end
Saviour healer Redeemer and friend

I will worship you for who you are
I will worship you for who you are
I will worship you for who you are
Jesus

My soul secure
Your promise sure
Your love endures
Always"
