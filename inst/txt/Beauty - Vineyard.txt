Vineyard

I close my eyes
And I see the beauty of Your face
The love that is there just shines
And there's no other place I'd rather set my
eyes

My body is Your temple
Warmed by Your flame
I love You with all my heart
And I know You love me the same way

I hear Your call
The sound of Your voice
Takes hold of my heart
And lifts me into Your arms"
