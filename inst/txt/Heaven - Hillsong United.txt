Hillsong United

I need Your Love
Like the desert needs the rain
I need Your touch
Like the fire needs the flame
One moment without You near
Is heartache I cannot bear
A lifetime with You oh Lord
Is Heaven I long to Know
Heaven

Come over me
Like the oceans meets the shore
Shine on my life
Like the morning
Steals the night
One moment without you near
is heartache I cannot bear
A lifetime with you oh Lord
Heaven I long to know
Heaven"
