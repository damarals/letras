"1" "Change Me On The Inside
Vineyard

I long for freedom to live in the truth
I want to be more like you
But every time I try to bring about change
I only touch the visible me

There's only one way I'm really gonna change

Just like David I cry out to YOu
Create in me a clean heart
I've grieved You again, I need Your release
From patterns that keep me in sin

There is only one way that I can finally break free

Change me on the inside
Change me on the inside
Change me on the inside

Change me on the inside
Change me on the inside
Change me on the inside"
