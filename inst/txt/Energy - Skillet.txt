v1:
power is another word that i use to describe you
your mighty winds come in and blow me away
frightening, coming at me like lightning
it's you that i fear, yeah yeah
i shake whenever you speak my name

pre:
and i'm surrounded
your overpower me

Chorus:
you're a silent rage
you're a hurricane
you are everything i can not see and can't explain
you're an enigma wrapped in a mystery
everywhere i go, i can't escape your energy

v2:
divine is a reality that you define
you defy time
i see you in everything in fire and wind and rain
captured is just the word to capture how i feel when i still
you are what i crave
you set me free i want to be your slave

(pre & chorus)

Bridge:
i can't escape your energy
