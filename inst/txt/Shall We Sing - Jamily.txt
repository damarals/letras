Jamily

Tomorrow I don't know
Know what's gonna be
I know my savior is
Always there for me
You died for me and
Raised to set me free
With a broken heart just go
Down on my knees

Faithful, he is
Forgiveness, he is
The truth and the way

Shall we sing, to the one
And bow down, to the one
Who lives

Shall we sing, to the one
And bow down, to the one
Who lives

Shall we sing, to the one
And bow down, to the one
Who lives

Shall we sing, to the one
And bow down, to the one
Who lives

Day by day I feel
Your care for me
I feel how much
I depend on you

You died for me and
Raised to set me free
With a broken heart just go
Down on my knees

Faithful, he is
Forgiveness, he is
The truth and the way

Shall we sing, to the one
And bow down, to the one
Who lives

Let's sing, let's dance
Let's shout to the lord
Let's sing, let's dance
Let's shout to the lord
Let's sing, let's dance
Let's shout to the lord
Let's sing, let's dance
Let's shout to the lord

Shall we sing, to the one
And bow down, to the one
Who lives"
