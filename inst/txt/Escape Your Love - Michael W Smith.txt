"1" "Escape Your Love
Michael W. Smith

It's like staring at the sky above
When I look in your eyes
Where in the world did you come from
You're so beautiful and I know

I can't escape your love
Escape your love
Escape your love

Everytime I turn around you're there
I get a feeling that won't go away
Nothing else in this whole world compares
You're surrounding me and I know

And in the largest crowd
Your face is all I see
I hope you know by now
That I just can't escape"
