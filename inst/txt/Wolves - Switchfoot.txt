"1" "Wolves
Switchfoot

Evening when the wolves come out
I'm a gloomy soul and I
Hear them howl in my head
Greedy
Autumn in the fading light
Trees are frozen, fingers are
Clawing, grab at the sky
Greedy and

Begin again
All of my world's a collision and spin
Hope is a war that we're already in
Awaken, O sleeper
Awaken, O sleeper

So far from the battlefield
Roses for the father's sons
See them red on the ground
Bleeding
When the revolution came
We were more than hungry men
We wеre hoping for more
Greedy

Now we bеgin again
All of my world's a collision and spin
Hope is a war that is yet to begin
Awaken, O sleeper
Awaken, O sleeper
A new day begins

Again, again
Again
Again"
