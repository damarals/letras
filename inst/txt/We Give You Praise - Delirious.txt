"1" "We Give You Praise
Delirious

When the road is rough and steep
And it leads a heart to weep
There’s an ocean of tears
That you‘ve caught through the years
But we’re not stopping here

On this long and winding street
Will you guide these weary feet
Every step that we take
With our hearts full of faith
And we’re not stopping here

Together we are stronger so put your hand in mine

We give you praise
We give you praise
And the king of all the earth
Has saved us from ourselves
We give you praise

Through the avenues of time
Here you meet me where I am
We walk with glory and pain
And you’ve broken the chains
So there’s no stopping here

We sing glory
In the darkness there you shine
Let it shine let it shine let it shine"
