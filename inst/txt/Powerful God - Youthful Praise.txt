"1" "Powerful God
Youthful Praise

How did I make it out
Of all the things that I was in
Almost lost hope
I saw no way that I could win

Then you rescued me
I should have never doubted you
My savior, you've always been able

[chorus]
But now I believe
I have seen your ability
Lord you have proven to me
That you're a powerful, powerful god

Yes he can solve any test
There's nothing he wont do for you
There is none that's too hard
For a powerful, powerful god

[lead]
Oh oh oh...

(say he's) he's a powerful god (3x)
(say yes) yes, (yes) yes...

Power... yes..."
