Hillsong United

God will always be my strength
Nothing less than christ my saviour
God will always be my hope
Nothing more than christ alone

And this will be my story
And this will be my song
My chains are broken
I am free

And this will be my story
And this will be my song
I'll praise you my saviour
Jesus

Take my life but give me Jesus
To know you god is why I live
Take the world but give me Jesus
For all my days I'll follow you

We lift your name up
We lift your name
You are higher
There's no one like you
Jesus"
