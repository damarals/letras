"1" "Journey Home
Vineyard

Sometimes I feel like I'm falling
Sometimes I feel higher than the stars
Sometimes I can hear You calling
Sometimes I feel lost.
But then I lift my eyes up
I see where I belong

Sometimes I feel weighed down by this treasure
When I think of all You've done just for me
Sometimes there's so much to discover
Sometimes I see the cost
But when I lift my eyes up
I see where I belong

Life is just a journey home
Then I will be with You
Life is just a journey home
Then I will rest with You
Life is just a way back home, to be with You

Oh, what a perfect day it'll be; no more tears, no misery

Life is a journey (4x)"
