Kutless - Need

You tore the veil
So my eyes could see
Your open arms
Right in front of me
Lord I feel blind
Make this darkness flee
You know exactly
What I need

(Chorus)

Help me God
I do believe
But I feel lost
And it's killing me
I need You right now
God please answer me
I know You're here
But it's hard to see
I need You right now

Trying myself
to figure it out
It's like standing on sand
And swimming in doubt
I know I'm not alone
If all of this time
You've been waiting
All of this time
For me to say it
Now I'm calling out

Help me God
I do believe
But I feel lost
And it's killing me
I need You right now
God please answer me
I know You're here
But it's hard to see
I need You right now


You tore the veil
So my eyes could see
Your open arms
Right in front of me
Lord I feel blind
Make this darkness flee
You know exactly
What I need

It's You! (3x)

Help me God
I do believe
But I feel lost
And it's killing me
I need You right now
God please answer me
I know You're here
But it's hard to see
I need You right now

You tore the veil
So my eyes could see
Your open arms
Right in front of me (2x)
