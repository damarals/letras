"1" "Who Is Like Our God
Skillet

Great is the Lord King Jesus
See how His majesty is lifted high
Great is the One who saves us
Who is like our God, Lord I lift You up

Age to age, always the same
Who is like our God?
Exalt the power of Your mighty name
Who is like our God?

King of Kings robed in glory
Who is like our God?
You rule the world with love and mercy
Who is like our God?/Who is like our God?

Chorus:
Great is the Lord King Jesus
See how His majesty is lifted high
Great is the One who saves us
Who is like our God, Lord I lift You up

Destiny is in Your hands
Who is like our God?
Turn to You the hearts of men
Who is like our God?

You conquered death, suffered the cross
Who is like our God?
You gave Your life to save the lost
Who is like our God?/Who is like ou God?

(Chorus)

Destiny is in Your hands
Who is like our God?
Turn to You the hearts of men
Who is like our God?

You conquered death, suffered the cross
Who is like our God?
You gave Your life to save the lost
Who is like our God?/Who is like our God?"
