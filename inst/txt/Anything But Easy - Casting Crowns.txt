Casting Crowns

I can see the path you've chosen
We both know where this is going
I'm afraid of how your story's gonna end
And as scared to speak as I am
I know this could be my last chance
To stand between You and forever's edge, yeah

It would be easy to talk about the weather
It would be easy to look the other way
But I love you too much to not say something
Without the truth my love means nothing
Sometimes love is
Anything but easy
Anything but easy

If I was trapped in a burning building
You would be the first one running
Bursting through the flames to rescue me
I can see your walls are crumbling
So, now I'm the one who's running
To save you from the fire that you can't see, yeah

It would be easy to talk about the weather
It would be easy to look the other way
But I love you too much to not say something
Without the truth my love means nothing
Sometimes love is
Anything but easy
Anything but easy

I can't paint your prison walls a brighter color
And never tell you of the One who set me free
I can't leave you locked in your chains any longer
So, let me lead you to the One who holds the keys

It would be easy to talk about the weather
It would be easy to look the other way
But I love you too much to not say something
Without the truth my love means nothing
Sometimes love is
Anything but easy
Anything but easy

Anything but easy
Anything but easy"
