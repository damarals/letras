"1" "On The Authority
Gaither Vocal Band

So many years I cried ‘cause my soul denied
That He would save a wretch like me
So full of gloom and dread that I hung my head
I wouldn’t claim the victory
Then one day His love like a winged dove
Settled down upon my life
And I realized he had authorized
My ticket to paradise

On the authority of the Holy Word
I rise up and take my stand
I’m a blood bought child of the living God
Who is the Great I Am
I’m an heir to all that heaven holds
And no principality
Can ever take away my royal crown
Given on His authority

It’s a mystery why He came to me
Why He would choose me for His own
Why He pulled me out of the lake of doubt
Set me right beside His throne
Why he guaranteed, with His seal decreed
My inheritance by right
I’m His favored child, and that makes me smile
I’m the center of His delight

On the authority of the Holy Word
I rise up and take my stand
I’m a blood bought child of the living God
Who is the Great I Am
I’m an heir to all that heaven holds
And no principality
Can ever take away my royal crown
Given on His authority

On the authority of the Holy Word
I rise up and take my stand
I’m a blood bought child of the living God
Who is the Great I Am
I’m an heir to all that heaven holds
And no principality
Can ever take away my royal crown
Given on His authority

I’m an heir to all that heaven holds
And no principality
Can ever take away my royal crown
Given on His authority"
