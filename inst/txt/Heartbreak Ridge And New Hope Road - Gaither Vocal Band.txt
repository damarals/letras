"1" "Heartbreak Ridge And New Hope Road
Gaither Vocal Band

It was a wide spot out in the country
Away from the lights of the city
Where an old time preacher pitched a raged old tent
Looked like it was a hundred years old
He started out preaching to no one
Pretty soon the crowd started gathering
And he preached the gospel at the corner of heartbreak ridge and new hope road
I turned into a wild man
Some people said I'd gone crazy
But all too soon came the harvest
Of the wild seeds that I had sown
I stumbled into the meeting
I was looking like death warmed over
Then I heard the gospel at the corner of heartbreak ridge and new hope road

Chorus
When they sang come ye sinners, lost and hopeless
Lord, I was hopeless heaven knows
It was something got ahold of me
Something got ahold halelluiah
When I heard the gospel at the corner of heartbreak ridge and new hope road

It's still a wide spot out in the country
Away from the lights of the city
I pitched that old tent that he gave me
The day he died and went home
Some times I start preaching to noone
Pretty soon the crowd starts gathering
And I preach the gospel at the corner of heartbreak ridge and new hope road

Chorus
And we sang come ye sinners, lost and hopeless
Lord, I was hopeless heaven knows
It was something got ahold of me
Something got ahold halelluiah
When I heard the gospel at the corner of heartbreak ridge and new hope road"
