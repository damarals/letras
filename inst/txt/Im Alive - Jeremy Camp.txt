"1" "I'm Alive
Jeremy Camp

I felt so overwhelmed with guilt
I don't know how many times that I'd fight it
I'd try it and barely survived it
I fell in the nearest pool of shame
Took the blame and everything that surrounds it
Well I found it and I drowned in it

Oh I never thought that I'd erase this or replace this feeling down
Oh but my whole life changed when you saved me and forgave me now

I'm alive, I'm alive like I've never been
Been revived from the lies that were deep within
It's the past now, it's the past
Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again

I lost everything I had
But I'm glad cause I would never have found you
Well it rings true the words that spoke through

You've given more than I can say
And I know that I could never repay you but I thank you
I can't wait to embrace you

Oh, I spun around for a long time and I always felt so blind
Oh, I never thought I could feel it well I feel it now

I'm alive, I'm alive like I've never been
Been revived from the lies that were deep within
It's the past now, it's the past
Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again

Oh I can feel it now every time I turn around
Knowing I have been set free from the pain and misery
Oh, I will make the most, of this hope I have

I'm alive, I'm alive like I've never been
Been revived from the lies that were deep within
It's the past now, it's the past Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again

I'm alive, I'm alive like I've never been
Been revived from the lies that were deep within
It's the past now, it's the past
Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again

I'm alive, I'm alive like I've never been
Been revived from the lies that were deep within
It's the past now, it's the past
Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again

Oh, I'll never thirst again
Oh, I'll never thirst again
I'll never thirst again

I'm alive"
