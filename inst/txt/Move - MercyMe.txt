MercyMe

I'm not about to give up
Because I've heard You say
There's gonna be brighter days
There's gonna be brighter days
I won't stop I'll keep my head up
No I'm not here to stay
There's gonna be brighter days
There's gonna be brighter days

I just might bend but I won't break
As long as I can see Your face

When life won't play along
And right keeps going wrong
And I can't seem to find my way
I know where I am found
So I won't let it drag me down
Oh I'll keep dancing anyway
Gonna move move
Gonna move move
Gonna move (gonna move,gonna move)

I've got to hold it steady
Keep my head in the game
Everything is about to change
Everything is about to change
This hurt is getting heavy
But I'm not about to cave
Everything is about to change
There's gonna be brighter days

I just might bend but I won't break
As long as I can see Your face

When life won't play along
And right keeps going wrong
And I can't seem to find my way
I know where I am found
So I won't let it drag me down
Oh I'll keep dancing anyway
Gonna move

No matter what may come
Gonna move to a different drum
No matter what life brings
Gotta move, gotta move to a different beat

I just might bend but I won't break
As long as I can see Your face

When life won't play along
And right keeps going wrong
And I can't seem to find my way
I know where I am found
So I won't let it drag me down
Oh I'll keep dancing anyway
Gonna move"
