"1" "Terrify the Dark
Skillet

No power on earth, no power in hell
Is gonna steal my peace
Ten thousand enemies, they will
End up on their knees

When I'm hopeless
I can know this
You're with me

Your light will terrify the dark
I call upon the name
That tears the night apart
My doubt will answer to your scars
And fear will have no place
No hold upon my heart

Your light will terrify the dark
(Your light will terrify the dark)
Your light will terrify the dark
(Your light will terrify the dark)

Where could I run, where could I hide
You're breaking in on me
Restore the ruins of my life
From rags to royalty

I can see you
I believe you
I trust you

Your light will terrify the dark
I call upon the name
That tears the night apart
My doubt will answer to your scars
And fear will have no place
No hold upon my heart

Your light will terrify the dark
(Your light will terrify the dark)
Your light will terrify the dark
(Your light will terrify the dark)

Break in on me
'Til all I see is you
Is you

Break in on me
Cuz all I need is you
Is you

Your light will terrify the dark
(Your light will terrify the dark)
Your light will terrify the dark
(Your light will terrify)

Your light will terrify the dark
I call upon the name
That tears the night apart
My doubt will answer to your scars
And fear will have no place
No hold upon my heart

Your light will terrify the dark
(Your light will terrify the dark)
Your light will terrify the dark
(Your light will terrify the dark)
No fear has a hold upon my heart
(Your light will terrify the dark)
Your light will terrify the dark
(Your light will terrify the dark)"
