Newsboys

One to another
Do you remember me
I feel so small
Well are you list'in tonight

So temporary
The things that i have seen
I ran so far
Will you take me back again

Entertaining angels
By the light of my t.v. screen
24-7 you wait for me

Entertaining angels
By the time i fall to my knees
Host of heaven, sing over me

One to another
The feelings in between
I won't let go
Of all you taught me - alright

Close as a brother
The way we used to be
I'll hold my breath
And i'll wait for you to breath

Entertaining angels
By the light of my t.v. screen
24-7 you wait for me

Entertaining angels
While the night becomes history
Host of heaven, sing over me

Entertaining angels
By the light of my t.v. screen
24-7 you wait for me

Entertaining angels
By the time i fall to my knees
Host of heaven, sing over me
Entertaining angels
By the light of my t.v. screen
24-7 you wait for me

Entertaining angels
While the night becomes history
Host of heaven, sing over me"
