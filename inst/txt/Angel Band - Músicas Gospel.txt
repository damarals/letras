MÃºsicas Gospel

My latest sun is sinking fast
My race is nearly run
My strongest trials now have past
My triumph is begun

Oh, come, angel band
Come and around me, stand
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home

Oh, bear my longing heart to him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin
And brings me victory

Oh, come, angel band
Come and around me, stand
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home

I've almost gained my heavenly Home
My spirit loudly sings
The Holy Ones behold they come
I hear the noise of wings

Oh come angel band
Come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal Home
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home"
