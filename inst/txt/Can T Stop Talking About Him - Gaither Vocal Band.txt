"1" "Can T Stop Talking About Him
Gaither Vocal Band

I was on my way to California
Leaving New York City far behind
Life was like a bundle of confusion
I was looking for love, could never find

Then I tuned into a gospel station
Heard about a Sweet Salvation
And then I gave all to Him
My heart, my soul and my mind

Chorus
And now I can’t stop talkin’ about Him
Can’t stop talking about the changes takin’ place in me
You know that I can’t be livin' without him
Things are getting clear and I can finally see

Life is like a celebration
'Cause I am a new creation
And now I can’t stop talkin' about Him, no
Everyday, everyday

So I was driving down the highway
Singing hallelujah and feeling fine
When this lawman pulled me over
Said to me you’re gonna walk the dotted line

He said I’ve got a strange suspicion
Just wondering about you’re condition
I said I’ve had a taste of what it means
To be alive

Chorus
So if you're wondering why
Why I'm so happy and free
Well, I'm here to testify
Look what he's doin' in me, in me

And now I can’t stop talkin' about Him
Can’t stop talkin’ ‘bout the changes takin' place in me
You know that I can’t be livin' without Him
Things are getting clear and I can finally see

Life is like a celebration
'Cause I am a new creation
And now I can’t stop talkin' about Him
Can't be livin' without Him
Can't stop talkin' about Him
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Can't stop talkin' about Him

I can't stop talkin' about Him
I can't stop talkin' about Him
I can't stop talkin' about Him"
