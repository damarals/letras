"1" "I'll Tell It Wherever I Go
Gaither Vocal Band

I'll tell of the Savior
I'll tell of His favor
I'll tell it, Lord, wherever I go.

I'll count every blessing
I'll go on confessing
I'll tell it, Lord, wherever I go.

What He is to you
Maybe you cannot see.
But this thing I know:
He's everything to me.

Oh, He'll be there
He'll meet me there,
Then go where He'll prepare
I'll tell it, Lord, wherever I go.

And if I were dying
With just one word to say.
I'd speak it for Jesus
And breathe my life away.

'Cause He'll be there
He'll meet me there
Then go where He's prepared
I'll tell it, Lord, wherever I go."
