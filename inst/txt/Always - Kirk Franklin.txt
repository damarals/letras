"x"
"1" "Always
Kirk Franklin

[Verse 1]
You know I've had some lonely days
I've made mistakes and had to pay
I've had some friends that walked away
Just like mama told me
But there's someone whose love is real
Who cares about the way I feel
Every pain, any race, every stain
There's peace when I call out your name
(Listen)

[Chorus 1]
Jesus, You're my everything
The cross, You did that just for me
So whatever You take me through
I promise you
I'll spend my always with you

[Verse 2]
No one can touch my heart like You
Or make me smile the way You do
I finally found someone who
Who really, truly loves me
And when my strength has come and gone
Your life in me it makes me strong
Your hand is where my heart belongs
You take all my pain and erased every stain

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Jesus, my whole life has changed
Since that day I cried Your name
For every time You've brought me through
I promise You
I'll spend my always with You

Did He say He'll never leave you?
Did He promise He'll never forsake you?
How many of you believe that in here?
Let me hear you
(Ohhhhhhhh oohhhhhh ohhh)
He won't let you down, right?
(Ohhhhhh ohhhhh)
He'll catch every tear
So if you know He can be your Father and He cares for you
Come on and stand on your feet and help me praise Him in here

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]"
