"1" "You Deliver Me
Selah

Deep as the ocean, bright as rain
This powerful emotion lifts me up above the plain
It's taking me to places I never thought I'd go
Showing me a grace I never thought I'd know

When I feel like I can't go on
You deliver me
And when the road is winding and way too long
You deliver me, You deliver me, yeah

I feel like a sinner whose sins have been washed clean
An absolute beginner whose heart has never seen
I must be forgiven for sometimes asking why
I was chosen to be given You in this life

When I feel like I can't go on
You deliver me, yeah
When the road is winding and way too long
You deliver me, You deliver me

When there's a distance
Oh, between what I am
And who I wanna be
You deliver

When I feel like I can't go on
You deliver me
When the road is winding and way too long
You deliver me

When I feel like I can't go on
You deliver me
When the road is winding and way too long
You deliver me, You deliver me

You deliver me"
