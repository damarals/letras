"1" "Lord, You're Holy
Danielle Cristina

Lord you're holy, Lord you're holy
And we lift you up and magnify your name
Lord you're holy, Lord you're holy
And we lift you up and magnify your name

I look around and I see
All the works your hands have made
The awesomeness of you
And how your love will never fade
Mere words cannot express what I feel inside
I can't describe your glory divine
But as a token of my love
This is what I'll do, I lift my hands and cry

Lord you're holy, Lord you're holy
And we lift you up and magnify your name
Lord you're holy, Lord you're holy
And we lift you up and magnify your name

There's not enough words that I can say
To tell you how much I appreciate
All the wonderful things you've given me
Your love and kindness, your tender mercies
It's my desire to praise you
I wanna praise you Lord
And to tell you how much I love you
Cause you're worthy of all the glory
And you're worthy of all the praise

See, I don't know why You would love me
Why You would show me so much mercy
Why You would suffer and die for me
Way back, way back on Calvary
But I thank you
I gotta thank you
Somebody help me thank Him
My heart cries and say
I give you all the praise

Wonderful, Glorious, Holy and Righteous
Victorious, Conqueror, Triumphant and Mighty
Healer, Deliverer, Shield and Defense, Strong Tower
My best friend, Omnipotent, Omnipresent
Soon coming King, Alpha, Omega, Lord of everything
Holy, Holy, Holy is your name
Holy, Holy, Holy is your name

Holy....
My God is holy
Holy...
The angels cry holy
Holy is your name
Holy...
My heart cries holy
Holy...
So holy, so holy
Holy is your name
