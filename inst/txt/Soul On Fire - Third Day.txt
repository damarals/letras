"1" "Soul On Fire
Third Day

God, I'm running for your heart
I'm running for your heart
Till I am a soul on fire
Lord, I'm longing for your ways
I'm waiting for the day
When I am a soul on fire
Till I am a soul on fire

Lord, restore the joy I had
I have wandered bring me back
In this darkness, lead me through
Until all I see is you

Lord, let me burn for you again
Let me return to you again
Lord, let me burn for you again
Let me return to you again

God, I'm running for your heart
I'm running for your heart
Till I am a soul on fire

Till I am a soul on fire
Till I am a soul on fire"
