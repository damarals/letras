"1" "Awesome God
Newsboys

When He rolls up His sleeves
Our God is an awesome God
He ain't just puttin' on the Ritz
Our God is an awesome God
There's thunder in His footsteps
And lighting in His fist
And the Lord wasn't joking
When He kicked them out the Eden
It wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood
His return is very close
And so you better be believing
That our God is an awesome God
Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from Heaven above
With wisdom, power and love
Our God is an awesome God"
