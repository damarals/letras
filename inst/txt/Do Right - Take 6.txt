"x"
"1" "Do Right
Take 6

Just can't keep on
Livin' like we're livin'

*I want to say
Love is just a game we played
Now I see it in a different way
And I wanna do right, before
Got to do right

**I never knew
Now that I know for sure
Well, You're makin' my dreams come true
And I wanna do right
Got to do right, got to do right

Chorus:
You've got to
Do right, do right, do right
Got to do right
(Do right, do right)
And He'll be your guiding light

Repeat
*Repeat
**Repeat
Chorus"
