"1" "I Have Been Redeemed
Vineyard

When I am lost
When I am all alone
Burdened by my sin and shame
There's one place I can go

I look towards the cross
Where my Savior died
Suffered in my place
The perfect sacri Æ’Oce
For me so I can know

Now I am forgiven
I have been set free
Through the blood of Jesus
I have been made clean
Now I know of His mercy because He
died for me.
I have been redeemed."
