Lauren Daigle

I will tremble at no other name
My heart's surrendered to no other reign
I will bow at no other throne
And rest my heart at no other home
Let these hands lift no other crown
Let these knees fall on no other ground
Draw these eyes from the gold that won't shine
You turn this life from water to wine

And I tremble
I tremble, Lord
In Your presence
In Your presence, oh, yeah

You take my breath with every starry night
Show Your power in downtown city light
You are taller than the highest of the hills
And stronger than the walls we try to build
You blind me with the beauty of Your face
And draw me close with Your divine embrace
Speak to me with healing in Your words
And fix the things I didn't know were hurt

Lord, I tremble (tremble)
I tremble, Lord
In Your presence
In Your presence, oh
Lord, I tremble (tremble)
I tremble, Lord
In Your presence
In Your presence, oh, yeah

My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, my Lord
My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, my Lord
My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, my Lord
To You alone, to You alone we praise (my Lord)
Oh, who could take the place of? (My Lord)
What compares to Your love? (My Lord)
For everything that You've done (to You alone)
To You alone be praise, yeah (my Lord)
Oh, who could take the place of? (My Lord)
What compares to Your love? (My Lord)
For everything that You've done (to You alone)
To You alone we praise

You invented all of time and space
Called the morning and midnight into place
Made the mountains and tamed the wildest seas
And still You set Your holy eyes on me
I will always live in wonder of
The fact that I awaken jealous love
Eternity will almost be enough
Eternity will almost be enough

Lord, I tremble (tremble)
I tremble, Lord
In Your presence
In Your presence, oh
Lord, I tremble (tremble)
I tremble, Lord
In Your presence
In Your presence, oh, yeah

I will always live in wonder of
The fact that I awaken jealous love
Eternity will almost be enough
Eternity will almost be enough
(Tremble) And I will always live in wonder of
The fact that I awaken jealous love
Eternity will almost be enough
Eternity will almost be enough

Lord, I tremble
I tremble, Lord
In Your presence
In Your presence, oh
Lord, I tremble
I tremble, Lord
In Your presence
In Your presence, oh

In Your presence
In Your presence
In Your presence
In Your presence
Ooh-oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
In Your presence
In Your presence
In Your presence
In Your presence
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
In Your presence
I'm glad that You're my present
In Your presence
Oh, I know I will live, yeah
In Your presence
Oh, in Your presence
In Your presence
Ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In Your presence
Oh, I will always live in wonder of
In Your presence
Just like that I awaken jealous love
In Your presence
Eternity will almost be enough
In Your presence
Eternity will almost be enough
In Your presence
Oh, I will always live in wonder of
In Your presence
Just like that I awaken jealous love
In Your presence
Eternity will almost be enough
In Your presence
Oh-oh-oh, Lord, I tremble"
