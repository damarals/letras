"1" "Mimi's House
Amy Grant

I remember many times when I was just a child,
How I played in that old house upon the farm.
With rocking chairs and squeaky stairs, all pieces of her world,
And a fire in her room to keep us warm.

'Cause no one is a stranger in Mimi's house,
'Cause love has made his home there in her heart.
And she's got that infectious way of laughing right out loud
That takes away my pain and lights the dark.

And now we're not as young as when I played there all the time,
And the visits seemed too scarce and far between,
But life goes on at Mimi's house, and in my mind I'm there,
With a fire in her room to keep us warm.

'Cause no one is a stranger in Mimi's house,
'Cause love has made his home there in her heart.
And she's got that infectious way of laughing right out loud
That takes away my pain and lights the dark.

And when I stop and think of how she's aging,
Growing strong and graceful in her God.
Well, you know it takes my fear away from aging;
She seems to know the secret that we'll never be apart.

'Cause no one is a stranger in Mimi's house,
'Cause love has made his home there in her heart.
And she's got that infectious way of laughing right out loud
That takes away my pain and lights the dark.

Yes, she's got that infectious way of laughing right out loud
That takes away my pain and lights the dark.
