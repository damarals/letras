"1" "Get This Party Started
Toby Mac

Everybody, everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your sould be free
I can feel the Most High shining on me, so...
Let's get this party started

Everybody, everybody in the place to be
Open up your mind and let your sould be free
I can feel the Most High shining on me, so...
Let's get this party started

Blind-sided by the blitz
Come on baby it's on
I couldn't wait to get on this
You ain't no quiet the storm
I'm gonna tell it like it is
Tere ain't no stopping us now
Somebody shut me up so I can live out loud

CHORUS

Them people thought I was gone
It's been a long time comin'
But straight out the box
We got the dark side runnin'
So Father, Most High won't You show Yourself
And shine on this record like nobody else
