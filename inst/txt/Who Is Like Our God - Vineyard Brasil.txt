"1" "Who Is Like Our God
Vineyard Brasil

Who is like our God
Who is like our God
Holy and intimate, tender and strong
Patient and powerful
Who is like our God

Who is like our God
Who is like our God
Mighty and innocent, jealous and kind
Sovereign and merciful
Who is like our God

All of man's glory fades away
Like a spring flower in the rain
No fallen angel is worthy to be worshipped
Nor anything created

Who is like our God
Who is like our God"
