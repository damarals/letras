Vida Reluz

AS I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES,I SEE ALL THE REASONS WHY,MY LIFE'S WORTH ATHOUSAND SKIES,YOU'RE THE SIMPLEST LOVE I'VE KNOWN,AND THE PUREST ONE I'LL OWN,KNOWYOU'LL NEVER BE ALONE. \"MY BANY YOU,ARE THE REASON I COULD FLY,AND CAUSE OF YOU,I DON'T HAVE TO WONDER WHY,BABY YOU,THERE'S NO MORE JUST GRTTING BY,YOU'RE THE REASON I FEEL SO ALIVE,THOUGH THESE WORDS I SING ARE TRUE,THEY STILL FAIL TO CAPTURE YOU,AS MERE WORDS CAN ONLY DO,HOW DO I EXPLAIN THAT SMILE,AND HOW IT TURNS MY WORLD AROUND,KEEPING MY FEET ON THE GROUD .\"I WILL SOOTHE YOU IF YOU FALL I'LL BE RIGHT THERE IF YOU CALL,YOU'RE MY GREATEST LOVE OF ALL."
