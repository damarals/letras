"1" "The Everlasting
Third Day

Owner of the universe
Higher than the kings of earth
Long before the world began
Everything was in Your hands
Your glory will forever stand

For You are the Lord
And You are God above
Your love goes on and on

You are the Everlasting Father
You are the Everlasting
You are the Everlasting Light (oh yeah)
Every knee shall bow (every knee shall bow) before You
You are the Everlasting Life

Through the raging of the seas
The hills proclaims Your majesty
All these things created for
The glorifying of the Lord
We'll praise Your name forevermore

For You are the Lord
And You are God above
Your love goes on and on

You are the Everlasting Father
You are the Everlasting
You are the Everlasting Light (oh yeah)
Every knee shall bow (every knee shall bow) before You
Lord of Mercy we adore You (we adore You)
You are the Everlasting Life

My heart cries out
My spirit shouts
I'll praise Your name forevermore"
