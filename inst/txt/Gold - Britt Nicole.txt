You were walking on the moon
Now you're feeling low
What they said wasn't true
You're beautiful
Sticks and stones
Break your bones
I know what you're feelin'
Words like those
Won't steal your glow
You're one in a million

This, this is for all the girls
Boys all over the world
Whatever you've been told
You're worth more than gold
So hold you head up high
It's your time to shine
From the inside out it shows
You're worth more than gold

You're worth more than gold

When everybody keeps score
Afraid you're gonna lose
Just ignore
They don't know the real you
All the rain in the sky can't put out your fire
Of all the stars out tonight
You shine brighter

This, this is for all the girls
Boys all over the world
Whatever you've been told
You're worth more than gold
So hold you head up high
It's your time to shine
From the inside out it shows
You're worth more than gold

You're worth more than gold

So don't let anybody tell you that you're not loved
And don't let anybody tell you that you're not enough
Yeah, there are days when we all feel like we're messed up
But the truth is that we're all diamonds in the rough

So don't be ashamed to wear your crown
You're a king, you're a queen inside and out
You glow like the moon
You shine like the stars
This is for you
Wherever you are

This, this is for all the girls
Boys all over the world
Whatever you've been told
You're worth more than gold
So hold you head up high
It's your time to shine
From the inside out it shows
You're worth more than gold

So don't be ashamed to wear your crown
You're a king, you're a queen inside and out"
