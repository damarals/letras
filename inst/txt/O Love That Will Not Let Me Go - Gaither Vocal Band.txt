"1" "O Love That Will Not Let Me Go
Gaither Vocal Band

O Love that will not let me go
I rest my weary soul in Thee
I give Thee back the life I owe
That in Thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be
O Love, that will not let me go.

Oh Joy, that seekest me through pain
I cannot close my heart to Thee
I trace the rainbow through the rain
And feel the promise is not vain
That morn shall tearless be
O Love, that will not let me go.

Oh Cross, that liftest up my head
I dare not ask to fly from Thee
I lay in dust life's glory dead
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be
O Love, that will not let me go.

O Love, that will not let me go."
