"1" "One Thing Remains
Jesus Culture

Higher than the mountains that I face
Stronger than the power of the grave
Constant in the trial and the change

One thingâ€¦ Remains (repeat)

Chorus:
Your love never fails, never gives up
Never runs out on me (3x)

Verse 2:
On and on and on and on it goes
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I never, ever, have to be afraid
One thing remains

Bridge:
In death, In life, I'm confident and
covered by the power of Your great love
My debt is paid, there's nothing that can
separate my heart from Your great love"
