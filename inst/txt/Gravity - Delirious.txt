Delirious

Round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round

History sits and she tells her stories
Bitter and twisted without power
Sitting watching feeding her jealous mouth
The future looks back to learn her lessons
Memories fade while experience beckons
I'm caught in the middle which way should I go

Gravity's pulling me, but heaven is calling me and

Chorus:
My head's spinning the world's twisted
My head's twisted the world's spinning
My head's spinning the world's twisted
My head's twisted the world's spinning round,
around

This generation is full of religion
Fed up with a diet of nothing
Give me the real thing flowing through my veins
This is the day, this is the hour
Show me the truth cos I want to be blinded
I wanna run, which way should I go

Gravity's pulling me, but heaven is calling me and

Chorus

These are the days that we'll look back upon when we're old
Give me tomorrow cos I cannot wait another day

Gravity's pulling me but heaven is calling me

Chorus

Turn around and face a brand new day
