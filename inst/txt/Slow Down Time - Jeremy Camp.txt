"1" "Slow Down Time
Jeremy Camp

Staring at this empty canvas
Waiting for the next stroke of my life
It seems to go by so fast

Another day I've wasted wondering
How it all ends up instead of resting
That it's all in Your hands

My only peace is waiting before You
With my praise to You drowning the noise around me

I wish I could slow down time
I wish I could wait here at Your feet
Cause with You is the only place that I wanna be

I know I should take it all in stride
I know You are there with every reach
Cause with You is the only place that I wanna be

On my own I always fade out fast
But on the rock my every step will last
I'm resting in your words that never fail

You're searching every part of me
I need to stop so I can hear you speak
I long for you so here I am so thirsty

My only peace is waiting before You
With my praise to You drowning the noise around me

I wish I could slow down time
I wish I could wait here at Your feet
Cause with You is the only place that I wanna be

I know I should take it all in stride
I know You are there with every reach
Cause with You is the only place that I wanna be

Oh, it's where I wanna be

The greatness of Your presence leaves me kneeling speechless
I've given up on making this life my home
The fullness of Your glory is beyond my comprehension
There's no greater joy than being with you my king

I wish I could slow down time
I wish I could wait here at Your feet
Cause with You is the only place that I wanna be now

I know I should take it all in stride
I know You are there with every reach
Cause with You is the only place that I wanna be

Slow down time, wait right here
The only place that I wanna be"
