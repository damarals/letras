Hillsong United

Lost and stranded
Empty handed
Broken down and all alone
Your mercy it entered
Into darkness
And enfolded us in love

We give You
All we are
For the glory
Of Your Name
We give all we are
For Your praise

Just a glimmer
Of Your glory
And the earth falls
To its knees
You level the mountains
With a whisper
And You calm
The raging sea

Let the earth
Come to life
In the light of heaven's glow
And the streets
Sound with joy
As the shackles lose their hold
You laid down Your life
For one and all
So we give all we are
To You alone

This means freedom
For the captive
And good news for those in need
Your message is justice
And compassion
God of love and Prince of Peace

With one voice
We sing hallelujah
All the earth
Cry out hallelujah
With the angels
Sing hallelujah
Jesus Christ is King

We give everything
To You alone
We give everything
To You alone"
