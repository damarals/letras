"1" "Love Of God
Vineyard

You are Messiah, the Savior of all
You came down from heaven to show us Your love
Bruised and rejected, You died on the cross
You came with the Father's heart that none would be lost
That none would be lost

(And) Oh how great is the love of God
(And) Oh how great is the love of God
(And) Oh how great is the love of God

(And) Oh how great is the love of God
(And) Oh how great is, is the love of God
(And) Oh how great is the love of God"
