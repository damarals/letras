"1" "In God We Trust
Hillsong United

Overwhelmed but I won't break
Trought the battle I will say
You grace will be enough
You grace will be enough
Under fire but we won't fall
We will never be alone
You'll always be enough
You'll always be enough

Now in God we trust
In his name we hope
I know
God will not be shaken
God is here with us
He's already won
I know
God will not be shaken

We will follow where you go
We will trust trought the unknow
I know you go before
I know you go before
Lead my heart now in your ways
For we're carrying your name
Your promisse never fails
Your promisse never fails

You'll finish what you've begun
Forever strong in your love
Your name is sure
And you will fight for us
Our hope forever secure
In you alone"
