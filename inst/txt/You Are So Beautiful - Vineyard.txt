"1" "You Are So Beautiful
Vineyard

Jesus You are the only One
The only reason for this song
I sing to You with all my heart
Jesus Your love has captured me
You are the treasure that I seek
I sing to You with all my heart

You are so beautiful
And I desire to see Your face
And You are so beautiful
And I desire to worship at Your feet"
