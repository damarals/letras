"1" "Come Be With Me
Amy Grant

Baby this life can break your heart
Everyone hurts to some degree
But while this world is fallin' apart
Why don't you come be with me?
Don't ya know that night can be so cold
When you're without the one you need
How much longer do I have to go
Waiting for you? Come be with me.
Love can be so simple when you let it flow
Get it in your head, feel it with your heart, send it from your soul
Look up at the stars burnin' bright
Listen to the wind whisper sweet
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right
Why don't you come be with me?
(Ooh Ooh Ooh)
Love can be so simple when you let it flow
Get it in your head, feel it with your heart, send it from your soul
Look up at the stars burnin' bright
Listen to the wind whisper sweet
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right (know the moment's right)
Why don't you come be with me?
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right (why)
Why don't you come be with me?"
