"1" "It's All Good
Warren Barfield

I got nothing to complain about today
Cause every broken piece is falling into place
You could try and shake the smile from my face
There's no way
It's all good

Can't you feel it now
Fate stealing down
The wrong is turning 'round
The bad is working out

Whoa oh oh oh oh
It's all good, it's all good, all good
Whoa oh oh oh oh
It's all good, it's all good, all good

The world is spinning and they say it's ending soon
But I hear heaven's angels sing a different tune
Yeah, from my point of view life is in bloom
Call me a fool
It's all good

Can't you feel it now
Fate stealing down
The wrong is turning 'round
The bad is working out

Whoa oh oh oh oh
It's all good, it's all good, good
Whoa oh oh oh oh
It's all good, it's all good, it's all good
It's all good, it's all good

Whoa oh oh oh oh
It's all good, it's all good
Whoa oh oh oh oh
It's all good, it's all good, good
Whoa oh oh oh oh
It's all good, it's all good, yeah

It's the simple things that shape the mood I'm in
Just to love and be loved how sweet it is
Well I've been lost and I've been found again
Life is facing fears and knowing it's all good

Can't you feel it now
Fate stealing down
The wrong is turning 'round
The bad is working out"
