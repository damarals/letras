"x"
"1" "Tonight
Jeremy Camp

In this time
I know I need to be more broken
Then I find
I feel this passion grow

I'll face all that's been lost
It's not too late to give control now
I don't know why I wait
You're always calling me

Tonight
I'll take my cross
Tonight
I'll count this cost
Tonight
I realize to take hold of this very moment

In this time
Control me by these words You've spoken
I feel inside
This neverending hope

I place all that I trust
In knowing one day I will see You
The only thing worth holding onto
Is holding onto me

Tonight
I'll take my cross
Tonight
I'll count this cost
Tonight
I realize to take hold of this very moment

I will take this moment
And I feel that it's closer
And I kneel to show You
This desperate heart of mine"
