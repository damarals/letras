"1" "Your Love Is Extravagant
Casting Crowns

Your love is extravagant
Your friendship, it is intimate
I feel like moving to the rhythm of Your grace
Your fragrance is intoxicating in our secret place
Your love is extravagant

Chorus:
Spread wide in the arms of Christ is the love that covers sin
No greater love have I ever known
You considered me a friend capture my heart again

Spread wide in the arms of Christ is the love that covers sin
No greater love have I ever known;
You considered me a friend

Capture my heart again
Your love is extravagant
Your friendship, it is intimate"
