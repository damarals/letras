"1" "So Far Away
Red

I am right here with you
I couldn't be more close
Pretending that I'm in this moment
When I'm only a ghost
I listen to the words you're saying
Words I'm fighting to believe
It's like I'm living from a distance
When you're just out of reach

I want to feel it
Want to mean it when I say it
Can you hear me at all?

And I feel so far away
Far away from everything
Outside wandering
When I got lost
I throw my arms up in the air
Why do I disappear
How can your love be so close
When I'm so far away

Remember when you found me drowning
Pulled me from the deepest end
I promised I would never leave you
But now I'm drowning again
It's killing me with every breath
Witnessing the life I've left
Only you know who I am
I'm reaching out my hand

I want to feel it
Want to mean it when I say it
Can you hear me at all

And I feel so far away
Far away from everything
Outside wandering
When I got lost
I throw my arms up in the air
Why do I disappear
How can your love be so close
When I'm so far away

I'm so far away
So far away, yeah

And I don't want to waste time
Living a half life
Are you listening
Give it back to me
I remember everything
The way it used to be
Give it back to me
Give it back to me
I hear you voice
But inside I'm lost

And I feel so far away
Far away from everything
Outside wandering
When I got lost
I throw my arms up in the air
Why do I disappear
How can your love be so close
When I'm so far away

I'm so far away
So far away, yeah"
