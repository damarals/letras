"1" "There Is An Exit
Shirley Carvalhaes

Far away I saw you
Standing by the roadside
Headless and without direction
Feeling so alone
Distressed heart pounding in his chest
You live bad times

It's all the same day
And you got tired of so much suffering
But I declare that the time has come
And god will get you out of this wind

If the fury of the enemy
Against you shall arise
He commands powerful angels to keep you
He was anointed
Redeemed and separated to win
And reign with him

God goes ahead guaranteeing
Victory for his children
Breaking the chains
Subjecting enemies because he is god
He brings water out of the rock
With this god there is none who can
There is no such thing as our god
There in egypt brought the plagues
And humbled the such of pharaoh
He exalted israel and made it known
That these people were not alone
Makes death come to life
For everything there is a way out
There is no god like that god

Elohim, el shaddai, adonai, worship his name
He is true god, he loved you first
Lift you off this ground
Elohim, el shaddai, adonai, worship his name
Makes death come to life
For everything there is a way out
Makes you a champion"
