"1" "The Day I Found Him
MÃºsicas Gospel

I'd looked down the road,
That I had traveled on.
I saw no hope in sight,
All my dreams were gone.

I'd found myself alone,
And had nowhere to go.
I was fighting for my life,
The Devil owned my soul.

Chorus:
I told lies to my friends,
And let my family down.
All I did was hurt them,
Until the day I found him.

When the Lord came to me
He put a voice in my head.
It said, \"son come to me\",
Before you end up dead.

He had opened up his skies,
And his love flowed to me.
When I felt the Lord's touch,
I saw how things should be.

Chorus:
I told lies to my friends,
And let my family down.
All I did was hurt them,
Until the day I found him."
