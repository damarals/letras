"1" "Say It Loud
Skillet

Can't help but speak of what I've seen and heard
I understand just what the purpose is
Uncover peace; uncover hope for all to see
And I can't keep quiet, gotta shout it out to You

Chorus:
Gotta say it loud
Gotta say it loud
Gotta say it loud
Gotta shout it out
(repeat)

Come right away to find the joy I've found
Don't hesitate to give up everything
Discover peace; discover hope, meaning of life
I've got to say it, gotta shout it out to You

CHORUS(repeat)

Can't keep it, keep it all to myself
Can't hold it, can't hold it down
Can't shut it, can't shut it out
Can't keep me silent

CHORUS(repeat)

"
