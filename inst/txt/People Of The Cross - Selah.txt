"1" "People Of The Cross
Selah

Home we're heading home
We journey on to see our savior face to face
Close we're getting close
Our joy is rising higher with each step we take
Forward on to Jesus

We are the people of the cross
We choose christ and count all else as loss
We won't be shaken
Hope won't be taken
We are the people of the cross

Grace if not for grace
We would be lost without the promise that you gave
Praise be ever praised
Your spirit burns within us brighter every day
Forward on to Jesus

Jesus we will be faithful till you meet us
Give us your courage as we finish
We want to hear well done"
