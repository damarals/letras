"1" "For Freedom
Jimmy Needham

(Galatians 5:1-2)

O to be delighted by you
And to see the colors of your train
And to be freed by you
That would be that would be
That would be my claim to fame
So rejoice my friend because my friend
You've got a friend and friend indeed
It is for freedom he set us free

But Simon says to fill your void
With toy after toy after girl after boy
After all isn't that what we were meant for
Please believe me when I say
It is for freedom he set us free

O poor us we sigh
Pour us out I cry
So we can be free

The bigger picture is there is a holy calling
O how I'm slowly falling
Falling falling in love
And your water has been pouring out on me
How could I be so naive
It is for freedom it is for freedom
It is for freedom he set us free"
