Chris Tomlin

From heaven to earth, our savior came
For us on a cross, he bled and died
And from the cross to an empty grave
He rose to life, he rose to life

He lives, reigning in power
He lives, name above all names
Hallelujah, now, forever
Hallelujah, christ is risen

All glory to him upon the throne
For ever exalted and seated high
The lamb of god, he has overcome
He is alive, he is alive

He lives, reigning in power
He lives, name above all names
Hallelujah, now, forever
Hallelujah, christ is risen, he is risen

And on that day, with him I'll rise
For christhe lives in me
This life I live no longer mine
For christ he lives in me (oh)

He lives, reigning in power
He lives, name above all names
Hallelujah, now forever
Hallelujah, christ is risen"
