"1" "All Hail Jesus
Vineyard

You made the moon that moves the waves
The burning sun to light the day
Yours is the name above all names

You formed the Earth
Both height and depth
The universe and endless space
Yours is the name above all names

All hail Jesus
The King above all Kings
Enthroned in majesty
You reign eternally"
