"1" "My Obsession
Skillet

Your touch, your ways
Leave me dumb without reason
Your love, my cage
My prison so pleasing
I spend my days
Tangled in thoughts of you
Stuck in this place
Resigned to be your fool

I thirst no longer
Drenching my soul
Pouring out like water


You're my only infatuation
Don't leave my stranded in my obsession
My purpose, my possession
Live and die, in my obsession
My obsession

Come down to me
Don't ever say that it's over
I kiss your feet
Worship the air you breathe
Your love, my gift
You go and I will follow
My dream, my wish
Don't leave me here so helpless


You're my only infatuation
Don't leave my stranded in my obsession
My purpose, my possession
Live and die, in my obsession
My obsession

I'm a lunatic
I'm going crazy
For just a word from
For just a touch from you

And I'm exploding like chemicals
I'm going crazy, can't get enough
2x

You're my only infatuation
Don't leave my stranded in my obsession
My purpose, my possession
Live and die, in my obsession
My obsession
2x

My obsession"
