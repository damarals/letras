"1" "Death Of Me
Red

I should've seen
All the signs are around me
But i was confortable inside these walls
So go ahead and take another piece of me now
While we all about down to you

[Chorus]

You tear me down
And then you pick me up
You take it all
Untill there is not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But i'm still bleeding
And you will be the death of me

How can you love my friction
If you're the sickness
And i'm the cure
Is too long i'll fake this addiction
Another sacrifice to make us pure

[Chorus]

You tear me down
And then you pick me up
You take it all
Untill there is not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But i'm still bleeding
And you will be the death of me [2x]

I won't forget
I cannot forget this
I won't forget
I'll never forget this
I won't forget
I cannot forget this
I won't forget
I'll never forget this

I won't forget
I cannot forget this
I won't forget
I'll never forget this
I won't forget
I cannot forget this
I won't forget
I'll never forget this

No i can never approve this ilusion
You are the one that i thought you were
So learn to abrange this ilusion
I will separate the stops you blew

[Chorus]

You tear me down
And then you pick me up
You take it all
Untill there is not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But i'm still bleeding
And you will be the death of me

Oh, oh
And you will be the death of me
(oh, oh)
I won't forget
I cannot forget this
And you will be the death of me
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
