would you believe me if i said...
that we are the ones who can make the change
in the world today...
would you believe me if i said...
that all of your dreams in your heart
can come true... today...
would you believe me if i said...
that life could be all that you want it to be... today...

chorus
and if i had wings i would fly
'cause all that i need, you are
and if the world caved in around me
to you i'd still hold on
cause you're all that i believe
and the one that created me
JESUS.. because of You.. i'm free

verse 2
would you believe me if i said...
that god can make miracles happen today
would you believe me if i said...
that you dont need to wait for the answers before..
you step out in faith..
would you believe me if i said
that nothing is ever IMPOSSIBLE.. for God..

Bridge
just live your life.. with God inside
you wont regret one moment of it
and give all that you can for God... for God\""
