Lauren Daigle

In the darkest hour, when I cannot breathe
Fear's on my chest, the weight of the world on me
Everything's crashing down, everything I have known
When I wonder if I'm all alone

I remember, I remember
You have always been faithful to me
I remember, I remember
Even when my own eyes could not see
You were there, always there

I will lift my eyes even in the pain
Above all the lies, I know You can make a way
I've seen giants fall, I've seen mountains move
I've seen waters part because of You

I remember, I remember
You have always been faithful to me
I remember, I remember
Even when my own eyes could not see
You were there, always there

I can't stop thinking about
I can't stop thinking about
I can't stop thinking about
Your goodness, goodness

I remember, I remember
You have always been faithful to me
I remember, I remember
Even when my own eyes could not see
You were there, always there
With me"
