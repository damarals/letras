"1" "Trust In You
Hillsong United

When I am found upon my knees
And all want is you to be with me
I know you show yourself so true
My hope is found in you

When I walk through the valleys though
If I am weary of the narrow road
I know you show yourself so strong
I know youâ€™re faithful
All my days I will trust
I will trust in you

And Though my heart and flesh may fail
Jesus I will trust in you

When I am found upon my knees
And all I want is you to meet with me
I know you show yourself so true
My hope is found in you

All my days I will trust
I will trust in you
And Though my heart and flesh may fail
Jesus I will trust in you

Hallelujah my soul will sing your praise"
