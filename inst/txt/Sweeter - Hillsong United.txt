Hillsong United

Everyday with you Lord
Is sweeter than the day before
Everyday with you Lord
Sweeter than the day before

Every morning I will worship
Every evening I’ll adore
Cause everyday with you is sweeter, sweeter than the day before

What a privilege to know you, like I know you
To be loved like you love me
What an honor to worship, truly worship
For this heart you have freed
From the raising of the sun
To the setting of the same

Everyday with you Lord
Is sweeter than the day before
Everyday with you Lord
Sweeter than the day before
Every morning I will worship
Every evening I’ll adore
Cause everyday with you is sweeter, sweeter than the day before

What a wonder to live like, really live like
Overcoming anything
What reason to lift, really lift up
Everyday my everything
From the raising of the sun
To the setting of the same

Everyday with you Lord
Is sweeter than the day before
Everyday with you Lord
Sweeter than the day before
Every morning I will worship
Every evening I’ll adore
Cause everyday with you is sweeter, sweeter than the day before

Everyday, Everyday with you Lord
Everyday, Everyday with you Lord
Everyday, Sweeter than the day before
Everyday, Sweeter than the day before"
