"1" "The Rivers Edge
MÃºsicas Gospel

My girl had found someone new,
I was tired of where I'd been
So I was headed to the river,
Where I'd planned to jump in.

I reached the rivers edge,
I had prepared for the end.
That's when God spoke to me,
Sayin' this would be a sin.

It was at the rivers edge,
That I saw a shinin' light.
It's where God spoke to me,
It's where he saved my life.

My worries all passed by,
And I found another girl.
God has opened up my eyes.
I'm in a different world.

It was at the rivers edge,
That I saw a shinin' light.
It's where God spoke to me,
It's where he saved my life."
