"1" "My One Desire
Vineyard

You full all the longings I've ever had
Unconditional love through Your merciful hand
A faithful Father who knows me day by day
I'm Your desperate child who needs to see
The glory of Your ways

You lift me up when I am down
Plant my feet on solid ground
Never knew one who cared so much
There's healing in Your touch

You're my Father
And my one desire
You're my Father
And my one desire"
