Vineyard

Alleluia, sing to the Lord
Songs of praise.
We bless You Lord.
We give to You glory
Due Your Holy Name.

We stretch out our hands
We stretch out our hands unto You Lord.
We lift up our voice
We lift up our voice inviting You into this place.
Hear us oh God,
As one we bring our praise;
A pleasing sacrifice.
To You oh Ancient of Days,
Ancient of Days."
