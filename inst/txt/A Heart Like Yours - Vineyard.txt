"1" "A Heart Like Yours
Vineyard

Create in me a humble heart
An innocent and childlike heart
Create in me a tender heart
That I mighty know You more

I want to know you in all of Your ways
Revealed in mercy
And clothed in Your grace
Give me a new heart, devoted to You
That knows how to love,
And mourns for the lost
And will not turn back
From all You have told me to do

Give me a heart like Yours
I need a heart like Yours
A heart like Yours"
