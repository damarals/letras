"1" "I Know Who I Am
Chris Tomlin

I know who I am
I know who I am
I know who I am
I am Your's, I am Your's

I know who I am
I know who I am
I know who I am
I am Your's, I am Your's

And You are mine
Jesus You are mine
You are mine
Jesus You are mine

I was running and You found me,
I was blinded and You gave me sight,
You put a song of praise in me
Ohhhhhh
I was broken and You healed me
I was dying and You gave me life
Lord You are my identity

And I know
And I know
I know
chorus2*

I am forgiven
I am Your friend
I am accepted
I know who I am
I am secure
I'm confident
That I am loved
I know who I am (I know who I am)
I am alive (I am alive)
I am set free (I am set free)
I belong to You
You belong to me"
