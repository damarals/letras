"1" "I Know You Can
Third Day

Give me the words to say
Bring me the strength to stand
Take all the doubt away
Jesus, I know you can
For if I'm to follow you
It's only by your hand
Help me to make it through
Jesus, I know you can

So close that I can taste it
I stand at the great unknown
Second chance and I don't want to waste it

I gotta know, I gotta know
You speak and I will listen
You ask and I will go
Lord, will you be there with me
I gotta know, I gotta know"
