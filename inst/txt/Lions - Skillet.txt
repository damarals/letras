[Verse 1]
Today we live, today we breathe
Today we know that we are strong when we are weak
Today we trust, we overcome
Take every chain that kept us slaves and throw em' off

[Pre-Chorus]
We're not waiting for permission
We defy our inhibition
Like our middle name is \"fearless\"
Unafraid

[Chorus]
If we're gonna fly, we fly like eagles
Arms out wide
If we're gonna fear, we fear no evil
We will rise
By your power, we will go
By your spirit, we are bold
If we're gonna stand, we stand as giants
If we're gonna walk, we walk as lions
We walk as lions

[Verse 2]
Today is ours, it's always been
Before we face the fight
We know who's gonna win
We live by faith and not by sight
We don't want safe and quiet
We don't wanna run and hide

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This is not an intermission
It's our time, not gonna miss it
You've already called us fearless
Unafraid

[Chorus]
If we're gonna fly, we fly like eagles
Arms out wide
If we're gonna fear, we fear no evil
We will rise
By your power, we will go
By your spirit, we are bold
If we're gonna stand, we stand as giants
If we're gonna walk, we walk as lions
We walk as lions

[Bridge]
Oh, everywhere we go
The battle has been won
We know you've gone before us
So, we take it hard in faith
With every step we take
We know we'll rise victorious

[Chorus]
If we're gonna fly, we fly like eagles
Arms out wide
If we're gonna fear, we fear no evil
We will rise
By your power, we will go
By your spirit, we are bold
If we're gonna stand, we stand as giants
If we're gonna walk, we walk as lions
We walk as lions"
