"1" "When Hope Came Down
Kari Jobe

So this is how it was
A silent night like any other
When heaven sent the one
The one that we will call our savior
And redemption began
In a stable in Bethlehem

All of the angels lifted up their voices
And filled the night with Hallelujah's
God is with us now
Everyone come and join the heavenly chorus
Our Savior King is here before us
All to hear the sound
The song creation sang
When hope came down

So this was truly God
Wrapped up in a tattered blanket
Love was finally here
Sleeping while the world awakened
And redemption began
With a baby in Bethlehem

All of the angels lifted up their voices
And filled the night with Hallelujah's
God is with us now
Everyone come and join the heavenly chorus
Our Savior King is here before us
All to hear the sound
The song creation sang
When hope came down

So let us sing Redemption Song
Let us worship Christ the holy one
We were lost, but we were found
When hope came down
When hope came down

All of the angels lifted up their voices
And filled the night with Hallelujah's
God is with us now
Everyone come and join the heavenly chorus
Our Savior King is here before us
All to hear the sound
The song creation sang
When hope came down
When hope came down
Ohh
When hope came
When hope came down"
