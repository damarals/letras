"1" "When You Fall
Kirk Franklin

When you fall, there are angels there to catch you when you fall
There's a saviour who can hear you when you call, when you call
When you cry, and you cannot figure out the reasons why,
Know that weeping only endures for a night, when you cry

When you fall, know that God will never take his love away
He's faithful to his people come what may, hear me say
When you fall

When your heart, has been shattered by the storm and torn apart
And you wonder when will the healing ever start, for your heart
Don't you know, that he loves you too much to ever let you go,
And the storm is there to only help you grow, he loves you so
When you fall....

When you fall, there are angels there to catch you when you fall
There's a saviour who can hear you when you call, when you call
When you cry, and you cannot figure out the reasons why,
Know that weeping only endures for a night, when you cry

When you fall, know that God will never take his love away
He's faithful to his people come what may, here me say
When you fall

Woohhh.......

Don't you know, that He loves you too much to ever let you go,
And the storm is there to only help you grow, (help you grow)
He loves you so (loves you so)

When You fall (3x)"
