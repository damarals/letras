The Caravans

Verse 1
If God is dead, what makes the flowers bloom?
If God is dead, what makes summer come in June?
If God is dead, who is listening and answers prayers?

Chorus
I'm glad I know He lives, He lives,
He lives, He lives, He lives, He lives.
I can feel Him moving through the trees,
in the wind, and the brezze.

And I can see Him shining through the night,
in the stars that shines so bright.
If God is dead, what makes my life worth living?
I'm glad I know He lives, He lives,
He lives, He lives, He lives, He lives.

Verse 2
If God is dead, who mends a broken heart?
If God is dead, who keeps night and day apart?
If God is dead, who can tell me where His body lies?

Chorus"
