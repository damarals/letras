"1" "Love And Harmony
Take 6

In the land of broken heart
By the shore of shattered dreams
Lies a river in the valley
We'll call Love and Harmony
We can search both high and low
Even sail the seven seas
But the Love of God will always lead to
Love and Harmony

Look at me
In the midst of all this trouble I've found happiness
And I owe it all to Someone who is heaven sent
To a world of lonely people
Who have tried their best so in need of rest
Now I know cuz I was out there searching seeking on my own
And the answer to the question was could there be more
And it's funny cuz the answer stood there all along
He heard my song
Always remember that Love's on your side

Now I don't feel that there's a need to worry
cuz I've found a stranger in this land
I've found the strength being in His hands"
