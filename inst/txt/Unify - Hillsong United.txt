Hillsong United

You reach out and rescued me...
answer to my dreams
and love hung on a cross
so we could meet...

Calmed my restlessness...
words fail to express...
there's nowhere I
would rather be than with You

the whole earth falls to it's knees...
at the sound of your beautiful name...
and all the voices in the world
unify today to bring You this sound of praise...

I call on You my King...
You open Your arms to me
and embrace me like
a father to a child"
