"1" "Born Again
Newsboys

I found myself looking into the mirror
knew I wasn't who I wanted to be
I was living life the way I wanted
But my eyes reminded I'm not free
Believed the lie so
Everything that I know
Says I gotta go
Tired of going so low
Never gonna go there again

This is what it is
This is who I am
This is where I finally take my stand
I didn't wanna fall
But now I gotta crawl
I'm not the One with two scarred hands
Giving him the best of, everything that's left of
The life inside this man
I've been born again

I see you walking like you're living in fear
Having trouble even looking at me
Wishing they would give you more than words
Sick of people telling how it should be (how it should be)
What's your download
Where'd you get your info
You saw their hype show
Now you're in the in-load
Gonna tell you what I believe, Oh

This is what it is
This is who I am
This is where I finally take my stand
I didn't want to fall, but now I gotta crawl
I'm not the One with two scarred hands
Giving him the best of, everything that's left of
The life inside this man
I've been born again

We are the ones he called by name
Never gonna look back
Let go let go the guilt, the shame
I said I'm never gonna look back
This is who I am

This is what it is
This is who I am
This is where I finally take my stand
I didn't want to fall, but now I gotta crawl
I'm not the one with two scarred hands
Givin' him the best of, everything that's left of
The life inside this man
I've been born again

This is what it is
This is who I am
This is where I finally take my stand
I didn't wan't to fall, but now I gotta crawl
I'm not the one with two scarred hands
Giving him the best of, everything that's left of
The life inside this man
I've been born again

I am born again"
