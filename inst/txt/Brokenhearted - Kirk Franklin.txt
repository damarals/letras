"x"
"1" "Brokenhearted
Kirk Franklin

Come ye broken hearted
Come ye weary soul
There is healing water
That can make you whole (2x)

Come bring tears of sorrow
Come bring years of pain
There is healing water
That can make you whole (2x)

And it flows from the veins
Of Jesus my savior, my healer
And reedemer
A lover so true
It has power to heal
All our sin sick diseases
So come to the throne
Your healling is here

Your healling is here
Forgivenes is here
Salvation is here
Acceptance is here
Deliverance is here
His presence is here
His Mercy is here
His power is here

Joy is here
Forgivenes is here
Salvation is here
Acceptance is here
Deliverance is here
His presence
His mercy is here
His power is here

Joy is here
Grace is here
Love is here

Than can make you whole (2x)"
