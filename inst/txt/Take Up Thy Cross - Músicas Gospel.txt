"1" "Take Up Thy Cross
MÃºsicas Gospel

I walked one day along a country road
And there a stranger journeyed too
Bent low beneath the burden of his load
It was the cross the cross I knew

Chorus:
Take up Thy cross and follow me
I hear the blessed Savior call
How can I make a lesser sacrifice when Jesus gave his all

I cried Lord Jesus and he spoke my name
I saw his hands all bruised and torn
I stooped to kiss away the marks of shame
The shame for me that he had born

Repeat Chorus"
