"1" "All Yours
Kutless

I love this world more than I should
It all falls short of what you're worth

How could I think I own my life
When really you're the one who paid the price

I wanna give you every breath
Every treasure that I hold
Oh lord, I give you everything

It's all yours anyway
You gave me life to give it away
It's all yours anyway
It's all yours

I've done my best and it's not enough
But I don't have to earn your love

Still I wanna give you every breath
Every treasure that I hold
Oh lord, I give you everything

It's all yours anyway
You gave me life to give it away
It's all yours anyway
With blood you brough my broken heart
So here I am, take everything
It's all yours anyway

You turned my heart around
I came running back to you
Oh what joy I found surrounded by the truth
That you love me and now I can see

It's all yours anyway
You gave your life to save me
So take my life"
