Vineyard

You're here I'm not alone
There is peace in my soul
And I Æ’Ond rest in Your love
I give it all,I give it up

So near So near
So near So near

Take my life take my all
Take my love and make me Yours

You're here You are mine
In this beauty I am high
And I'm new breaking free
This is so amazing I want to see

My loving Father loving Father"
