The Edwin Hawkins Singers

Chorus:
What a time when we all get to heaven,
what a time, what a time, what a time.
When the saints of God are gathered around the throne,

Sopranos: Oh what a time,
All: time, what a time that will be.

Bridge:
We'll be singing, praises ringing.
Saints rejoicing up in glory forevermore.

Sopranos: Oh what a time,
All: time, what a time that will be.

Vamp 1:
We're gonna have a time
when we all get to heaven.

We're gonna have a time,
we're gonna have a good time.

Vamp 2:
We're gonna have a time.

We're gonna have a time,
we're gonna have a good time.

Vamp 1

Vamp 3:
We're gonna have a time.

Ending:
When the saints of God are gathered around the throne,
(repeat as desired)

Sopranos: Oh what a time,
All: time, what a time
(repeat as desired)

Sopranos: Oh what a time,
All: time, what a time that will be."
