"1" "Your Love Is A Song
Switchfoot

I hear you breathing in
Another day begins

The stars are falling out
My dreams are fading now, fading out

I've been keeping my eyes wide open
I've been keeping my eyes wide open

Your love is a symphony
All around me
Running through me

Your love is a melody
Underneath me
Running to me

Your love is a song

The dawn is fire bright
Against the city lights

The clouds are clowing now
The moon is blacking now,is blacking out

I've been keeping my mind wide open
I've been keeping my mind wide open

Your love is a song

With my eyes wide open
I've got my eyes wide open
I've been keeping my hopes unbroken"
