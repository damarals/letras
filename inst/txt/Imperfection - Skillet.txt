Skillet

V1:
Your worth so much
It'll never be enough to see what you have to give
How beautiful you are
Yet seem so far from everything you're wanting to be

Pre:
Tears falling down again
Tears falling down

Chorus:
You fall to your knees
You beg, you plead
Can I be somebody else for all the times I hate myself?
Your failures devour your heart in every hour
You're drowning in your imperfection

V2:
You mean so much
That heaven would touch the face of humankind for you
How special you are
Revel in your day
You're fearfully and wonderfully made

(Pre & chorus)

V3:
Your worth so much
So easily crushed
Wanna be like everyone else
No one escapes
Every breathe we take dealing with our own skeletons"
