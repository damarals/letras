"1" "Come, Thou Fount Of Every Blessing
Amy Grant

Come, thou Fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

Teach me ever to adore thee,
May I still thine goodness prove
While the hope of endless glory
Fills my heart with joy and love

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to thee.
Never let me wander from thee
Never leave thee God I love
Here's my heart, take and seal it,
Seal it for thy courts above.

Never let me wander from thee
Never leave thee, God I love
Here's my heart, take and seal it,
Seal it for thy courts above.
