"1" "Forced Into Fire
For Today

Life or death? Open your eyes before there's nothing left
Life or death? I fear we're facing our final breath
Life or death? Open your eyes before there's nothing left
Life or death? I fear we're facing our final breath

Living on borrowed time, dwelling in despair
The weight of our malevolence is more than we can bear

Forced into fire. Purify a world rotting to the core
Forced into fire. We can't revive a world forever at war

In the midst of desolation, there is a call to a new life
(call to a new life)
Take the scars from my soul, draw out the parasite

The heavens cry tears of blood for the fallen world
Where is the standard of man within the lawless plague?
The heavens cry tears of blood for the fallen world
Where is the standard of man? Distorted by hatred
Hatred and rage

Forced (forced) into fire
Forced (forced) into fire

Life or death? Open your eyes
before there's nothing left
Life or death? I fear we're facing our final breath
Life or death? Open your eyes
before there's nothing left
Life or death? I fear we're facing our final breath

The heavens cry tears of blood for the fallen world

The heavens cry tears of blood
Tears of blood for the fallen world
The heavens cry tears of blood
Tears of blood for the fallen world"
