"1" "Glad I've Passed the Test
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

Seems like there's something everyday
Some new test that comes my way. (Something everyday)
I never know what it might be
But whatever it might be
I know I have the key

Coz' I can face it if I'm steady
And prepare so I'll be ready
How to act and what to say
When a challenge comes my way
At times it's tough for me out there
And so I turn to God in prayer

I pray I'll pass each test
Everyone that comes my way
I pray I'll pass each test
And be faithful through the day

Some things I know I'll face again
Like the pressure to fit in. (Face it once again)
There will be times when other kids
Do the things that God forbids
(The things that God forbids)

And pressure need to go along with
Kids I know I don't belong with
That's the time I call to mind
I don't want to be that kind
Coz' I'm a witness for God's name
So there's no cause to be ashamed

I'm glad I've passed the test
I was faithful all day long
I'm glad I've passed the test
I'm glad that I was strong"
