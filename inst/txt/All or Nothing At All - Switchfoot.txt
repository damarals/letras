"1" "All or Nothing At All
Switchfoot

I can't say I didn't see it coming
I pushed the pedal and we hit the wall
I can't say I don't want nothing
I want it all, or nothing at all

I should've known, should've known better
I can't say I didn't see you fall
I won't settle for your love letters
I want it all, or nothing at all

You feel your heartbeat loudest when it's breaking
You and I both know our fatal flaws
We both know that love is what you make it
I want you
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all

There's a fault line here running
The walls shake like a cannon ball
So fight fair if you love something
Yeah, but I'm sick of fighting at all

I can't say that I don't get it
I want it all, or nothing at all

You feel your heartbeat loudest when it's breaking
You and I both know our fatal flaws
We both know that love is what you make it
I want you
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all

We won't stop till we're getting it right
We won't stop till we're getting it right
Now I know, now I know better
I want it all, or nothing at all

You feel your heartbeat loudest when it's breaking
You and I both know our fatal flaws
We both know that love is what you make it
I want you
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all"
