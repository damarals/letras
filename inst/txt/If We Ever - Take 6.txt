Chorus:
If we ever needed the Lord before
We sure do need Him now
Oh, we sure do need Him now
Oh, Lord, we sure do need Him now
(Oh, glory) If we ever needed the Lord before
We sure do need Him now
We need Him every day and every hour

Repeat chorus

We need Him in the morning
We need Him in the night
We need Him in the noonday
When the sun is shining bright

Repeat chorus

We need Him when we’re happy
We need Him when we’re sad
We need Him when we’re burdened
Just to make our hearts feel glad

Bridge:
(O glory) We need Him, we need Him
We really, really, really need Him
In the morning, in the night
We need Him in the noonday
When the sun is shining (shining bright)
(Oh) We need Him, we need Him
We really need Him
When we’re happy, when we’re sad

We need Him when we’re burdened
Just to make our hearts feel glad
(O glory / You know that…)

Repeat bridge
Repeat chorus

We need Him every day and every hour
We need Him every day and every hour
(Minute by minute by minute)
We need Him every day and every hour
(Every day and, and every hour)"
