"1" "Keep Your Head Up
Fireflight

I hear you say you're broken
I hear you say you're barely
Holding on, holding on
I can see you've fallen
I can feel you've started
Letting go, letting go

I can't say it's gonna get easier
Every day fighting to keep hope alive
Keep your head up, my child
Through it all you're never gonna walk alone
I'll take every step, every fall by your side
Keep your head up, my child

As the road gets harder
It only makes you stronger
Pushing on, pushing on
And in your darkest hour
When life beats you down
I'll carry you, I'll carry you

I can't say it's gonna get easier
Every day fighting to keep hope alive
Keep your head up, my child
Through it all you're never gonna walk alone
I'll take every step, every fall by your side
Keep your head up, my child

When you're on the edge
I will hold you tight
When you're all alone
I can help you fight
I will hold the torch
In the blackest night
For you

And there's no shame in letting go
I'll hold onto you
I'll never stop holding onto you
Keep your head up, my child

I can't say it's gonna get easier
Every day fighting to keep hope alive
Keep your head up, my child
Through it all you're never gonna walk alone
I'll take every step, every fall by your side
Keep your head up, my child

Keep your head, keep your head up, my child
Keep your head up, my child"
