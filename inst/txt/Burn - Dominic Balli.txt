"1" "Burn
Dominic Balli

Shadows in the night
They must must be oh oh oh
Til they're humbled by the glowing of
Our atmosphere

I got a fire
Let me light you up
Together
We could burn as one

Burn burn
Let it burn ablaze
Let the fire go
Make the people feel it's rage
Burn burn
Let it burn ablaze
Let me light you up

Candles in the dark
They must must shine oh oh oh
'Til the coming of the dawn ignite
Our atmosphere

No matter what come may
Come may come may
No matter what's done
When they come come they
No matter what come may
Come may come may
Our fire won't fade when they
Come come they"
