"1" "Your Love Like A Fire
Hillsong United

And I am desperate for Your touch
A glimpse of heaven through the glory of Your son
In a moment You can turn a life around
Forever to be found in You

And I'm reaching out to find
There's nothing greater then the love that holds my life
Your grace and mercy save me by Your blood
Swept away my shame away O Lord

Your love is like a fire
Burns for all to see
My only desire to worship at your feet
So let Your fire consume my life

Let Your love take me deep
Drawing me closer
All I want is more of You
When you come I will follow
At the cross I surrender all
Jesus I belong to You

And I am surrendered to Your love
Forever humbled by the message of the cross
I stand in abandoned in Your presence and embrace
I never be the same O God"
