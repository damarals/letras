"x"
"1" "Louder
Dominic Balli

They say sticks and stones can break your bones
But words they never hurt
Can turn a spark into a flame and then the fire burns
But I've heard words that shatter souls
They knock you down down
They break you down down
Them words but loudest can be heard

All around the world you can feel it moving
Shaking foundations waking up nations
Listen to the sound you can hear it calling
Don't matter 'bout them sticks and stones
Love is louder

You know a bitter tongue is a bullet slung
It'll shoot some people down
And a gentle word though itâ€™s seldom heard
Can wipe away a frown
They can lift your soul to the highest heights
Or knock you down down
They break you down down
Them words but loudest can be heard

La la la love
La la la love
La la la love is louder
La la la love
La la la love
La la la love is loud"
