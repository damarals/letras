Joy to the world
The Lord has come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let no sins and sorrows grow
Nor thorns infest the ground
He makes His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found
Rejoice the Savior reigns
Let us our songs employ
While fields and floods
And rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Glory in the highest
Holiness has become like us
To be like Him
And so begins
Glory in the highest
Holiness has become like us
To be like Him
And so begins
Emmanuel, Emmanuel
God with us
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him"
