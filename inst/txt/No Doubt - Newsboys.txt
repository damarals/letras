I've seen it in the way that You move
There's never been a mountain in my life
That You couldn't find a way to break through
With you in my corner, I know can't lose

Even when life feels like a roller coaster ride
Highs and lows and all the unknowns

There's no doubt
You are the only who has never let me down
There's no doubt
You've never left my side so I know You're with me now
You are always faithful, always true
In a world of questions, God, with You
There's no doubt
No doubt
Therе's no doubt
No doubt

It's easy to forget what You've donе
When the walls are closin' in and the ground, it shakes
But every time it feels like too much
Your strength is more than enough, more than enough

Even when life feels like a roller coaster ride
Highs and lows and all the unknowns

There's no doubt
You are the only who has never let me down
There's no doubt
You've never left my side so I know You're with me now
You are always faithful, always true
In a world of questions, God, with You
There's no doubt
No doubt
There's no doubt
No doubt

You keep every promise
What you start, You finish
There's no doubt
You prove it
Again and again
Again and again
You keep every promise
What you start, You finish
There's no doubt
You prove it
Again and again
Again and again

There's no doubt (Oh oh oh)
You are the only who has never let me down
There's no doubt
You've never left my side so I know You're with me now
You are always faithful, always true
In a world of questions, God, with You
There's no doubt
No doubt (Whoa oh-oh-oh)
There's no doubt
No doubt (Ooh)

You keep every promise
What you start, You finish (No doubt)
There's no doubt
You prove it
Again and again
Again and again
You keep every promise
What you start, You finish
You keep every promise
What you start, You finish"
