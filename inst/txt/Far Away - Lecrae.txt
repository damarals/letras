"1" "Far Away
Lecrae

Far far away far away far away (You feel so)
Far far away far away far away
Hopeless!
I can spell it

I can smell it in the air
Lotta people wonder if you still care
And are you still there
Cause I lost it all

I keep calling your name
But do you hear my call
And are you still involved
Or am I left alone

I wander the streets
Cause I no longer have a home
My brothers all gone
My sisters all gone

My family and my friends
Ain't gonna be here in the morning
You see me here mourning
They say you feel my pain

They say you went through it
Say to die is to gain
But I ain't gain nothing
I lost everybody

Now I'm losing my mind
And my faith is all got in
I'm still holding on
That's why I still pray

Feeling empty inside
I can't make it through the day
I don't know what else to do
I don't know what else to say

I'm talking to you now
But I promise that you feel so far
[Chorus] (x4)
Far far away (You feel)

Far away (You seem)
Far away...so so
Dear hope, been waiting on ya for a while now
Been cut so deep that I ain't sure if I can smile now

Look at this devastation
Look at the pain and sorrow
Somebody fed me lies and promised me a bright tomorrow
I know the God I follow

Is bigger than disaster
Big enough to handle
Any evil that harasses us

But I feel like he passed us
Pain overtook us
Buildings tumbled over head
As the ground shook us

God have you forsook us
Lord you still with me
I know you save souls
I trust you to forgive me

Relief can you hear me
Hey Rest can you get me
Hey Peace can you see me
Hey Love can you heal me

I don't know what to do
I ain't looking for answers
I just need you to hold my hand
Through this cancer

Tell me you never left
Even in the midst of death
Breathe on me I'll do anything to feel your breath

[Chorus] (x4)
Far far away (You feel)
Far away (You seem)
Far away...so so
For God alone, O my soul,
Wait in silence, for my hope is from Him.
He is my only rock and my salvation, my fortress
I shall not be shaken.
On God rests my salvation and my glory
My mighty rock, my refuge is God.
Trust in him at all times, people
Pour out your heart before him,
God is a refuge for us.

Far far away (He's not)
Far away (No he's not)
Far away (Our God's not)
Far far away (He's not)
Far away (No he's not)
Far away (Our God's not)
Far far away (He's not)
Far away (No he's not)
Far away (Our God's not)
Even though He seems"
