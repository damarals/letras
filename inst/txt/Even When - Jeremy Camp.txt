"1" "Even When
Jeremy Camp

You know and you see, the times of my defeat
When I fail to realize your kindness
Reaches through all my fragile fears of wasting any years
I see you go beyond my silent feelings

(Chorus)
Even when I wrote my life away
You still receive me
Even when I wrote my life away
You still receive me

You took this fading heart and softened every part
I'll rest in light of what you've promised to me

I'll always stay strong cause I feel you
Holding on now to you I belong
And I know
And you hear me...

(Chorus)"
