"1" "I'll Lead You Home
Michael W. Smith

Words & Music: Michael W. Smith and Wayne Kirkpatrick

Wandering the road of desperate life
Aimlessly beneath the barren sky
Leave it to me
I'll lead you home
So afraid that you will not be found
It won't be long before your sun goes down
Just leave it to me
I'll lead you home

Chorus:
Hear me calling
Hear me calling
Just leave it to me - I'll lead you home

A troubled mind and a doubter's heart
You wonder how you ever got this far
Leave it to me, I'll lead you home

Vultures of darkness ate the crumbs you left
And you got no way to retrace your steps
Just leave it to me
I'll lead you home

Chorus 2:
Hear me calling
Hear me calling
You're lost and alone
Leave it to me
I'll lead you home

Chorus 2

So let it go and turn it over to
The one who chose to give his life for you
Leave it to me
I'll lead you home

So let it go and turn it over to
The one who chose to give his life for you
Just leave it to me
I'll lead you home
Leave it to me
I'll lead you home

Chorus 2
