Third Day

Late one night she started to cry
And Thought \"He ain't coming home\"
She was tired of the lies
Tired of the fight
But she didn't wanna see him go
She fell on her knees and said
I haven't prayed since I was young
But \"Lord above, I need a miracle\"

Well, no matter who you are
And no matter what you've done
There will come a time
When you can't make it on your own
And in your hour of desperation
Know you're not he only one
Prayin' \"Lord above, I need a miracle\"
I need a miracle

He lost his job and all he had
In the fall of '09
Now he feared the worst,
That he would lose his children and his wife
So he drove down deep into the woods
And thought he'd end it all
And prayed \"Lord above, I need a miracle\"

Well, no matter who you are
And no matter what you've done
There will come a time
When you can't make it on your own
And in your hour of desperation
Know you're not the only one
Prayin' \"Lord above, I need a miracle\"
I need a miracle

He turned on the radio
To hear a song for the last time
He didn't know what he was looking for
Or even what he'd find
And the song he heard it gave him hope
And strength to carry on
And on that night
They found a miracle
They found a miracle

And in your hour of desperation
Know you're not the only one
Prayin' \"Lord above, I need a miracle\"
\"Lord above, I need a miracle\""
