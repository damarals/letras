"1" "Even Here You Are
Vineyard

God You have searched me
You know my ways
My thoughts You perceive from afar
Before I speak
You know what I'll say
Your hand is placed gently on me

(PRE-CHORUS)
There's not a place
Where You will not be
In heaven or earth
Your love will find me

My God even here You are
My God
My God even here You are
My God

When darkness hides me
There's evil around
And tears are the food for my soul
You make the night
Shine like the day
Even there Your hand will guide me"
