"1" "Say It With Your Life
Warren Barfield

There is too much talk, yeah there's a lot of noise,
Does the way you walk drawn out your voice?
There messages this world needs to hear,
To live in loud and clear

It can't describe, but change inside
It awful show that's the reason why
Cause words just compromise to the way
You say it with your life

Have the movie you make, tells who you are?
Your actions speak what is in your heart
Let every step we live the truth
Of the hope that's really you

It can't describe but change inside
It awful show that's the reason why
Cause words just compromise to the way
You say it with your life

It can't describe but change inside
It awful show that's the reason why
Cause words just compromise to the way
You say it with your life

Oh! you know what you got to do
When everyone's watching you
Let them see what means to be light. shine!
Come on everybody now! shine!

Cause you will now mean to shine!
You will now mean to shine!
You got to say it with your life!
Come on! say it with your life!"
