"x"
"1" "Drop The World
Warren Barfield

She's in so much pain
I wish I could take it all away
She deserves a break, she is good
She's been through more than any one person should
God, please hold her tonight

Take away the loneliness that she is left with
She is left with no other hope but you
They say that You hold the world in Your hands
Please hear my prayer tonight
Drop the world
And hold her

She thinks her life is over
She's convinced this is the end
But You can show her a better love than she's ever known
You can make her love again
God, please hold her tonight

Take away the loneliness that she is left with
She is left with no other hope but you
They say that You hold the world in Your hands
Please hear my prayer tonight
Drop the world
And hold her

I wish I could turn back time
Or even make it fly
To any time but now
'Cause now she hurts so bad

So take away the loneliness that she is left with
She is left with no other hope but you
They say that You hold the world in Your hands
Please hear my prayer tonight
Drop the world
And comfort her
Drop the world
And hold her"
