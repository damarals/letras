"1" "O Come All Ye Faithful
Casting Crowns

O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, oh come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the king of angels
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Sing, Choirs of angles
Sing in exultation
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above!
Glory to God
Glory in the highest
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus to Thee be all glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Come let us adore him
He is Christ the Lord
Sing choirs of angels
Come let us adore him
Come let us adore him
