"1" "Lead Me To The Cross
Hillsong United

Savior I come quiet my soul, remember
Redemption's hill where your blood was spilt
For my ransom

Everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost

Chorus

Lead me to the cross where your love poured out
Bring me to my knees, Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself I belong to you
Oh lead me, lead me to the cross

You were as I, tempted and trialed, human
The word became flesh bore my sin and death
Now you're risen

To your heart, to your heart
Lead me to your heart
Lead me to your heart"
