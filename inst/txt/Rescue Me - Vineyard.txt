Vineyard

'Cause Your love is better than life

My lips will always praise You
Peace has escaped me as I lie awake

Through the night waiting
I have never been more patient
Than when I anticipate You

And I lie on my back while the tears

Run down my neck like intercession

Am I just scared that I might really hear Your voice

And I know it deep inside

'Cause then I turn and give the keys to my fears

And let them steal You away

Am I just scared 'cause I really hear Your voice

But then I turn and give the keys to my fears

And let them steal You away

Rescue me as I cling to You
Desperately

And I need Your voice to say
This is My own

And nothing will separate me"
