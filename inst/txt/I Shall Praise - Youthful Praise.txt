"1" "I Shall Praise
Youthful Praise

I shall praise the name of the Lord
I won't let anything hinder me
I won't let anything hinder me
While I stand in the house of the Lord
I shall praise, I shall praise, I shall praise
I shall sing, I shall sing, I shall sing,

For the Lord is good and
His mercy endureth forever
(3x)

For the Lord is worthy of the highest praise
Praise (Hallelujah Hallelujah) (4x)

Praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah, Hallelujah (2x)

For the Lord is good and
His mercy endureth forever
(repeat)

Mercy endureth forever

For the Lord is good and
His mercy endureth forever
For the Lord is worthy of the highest praise"
