"1" "Wash Over Me
Vineyard

When the tears are falling
And the leaves blow across my mind
When the waves are breaking
And the sun is hard to find

When the deep is calling
And the waterfall's my home
When I'm all but drowning
And I'm treading on my own

I cry a silent prayer
That comes out of me
It's a mystery
Come wash over me
Wash over me
'Til I can't take any more

I dream that my voice is heard
In the secret place
Where I bare my face
Come wash over me
Wash over me
'Til I can't take any more"
