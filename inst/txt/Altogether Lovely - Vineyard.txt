"1" "Altogether Lovely
Vineyard

Lord i love to feel your presence
Resting tenderly
An intoxicating fragrance
I breathe you into me

Chorus:
You're beautiful, altogether lovely
You're wonderful
Forever i will be in love with you

Lord your spirit is the essence
Of life itself to me
And to be here in your presence
Is all i'll ever need


Bridge:
To look into your eyes of fire
To gaze upon your face
Is everything my heart desires
As i come into this place"
