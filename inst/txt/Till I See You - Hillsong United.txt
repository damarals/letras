"1" "Till I See You
Hillsong United

The greatest love that anyone could ever know
That overcame the cross and grave to find my soul
And till I see you face to face
And grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in you

With all I am I'll live to see your Kingdom come
And in my heart I pray you'd let your will be done
And till I see you face to face
And grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in you

I will live to love you
I will live to bring you praise
I will live a child in awe of you

You are the voice that called the universe to be
You are the whisper in my heart that speaks to me
And till I see you face to face
And grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in you

You alone are God of all
You alone are worthy Lord
And with all I am my soul will bless your name"
