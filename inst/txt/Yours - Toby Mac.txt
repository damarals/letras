"x"
"1" "Yours
Toby Mac

Every time I turn my back I get the feeling that
I'm 'bout to take a shot to the skully with a bat
I'm out of control, need you to fill my soul up
And could you shed a little light on the skeletons holed up
My past is taking me to task
And I can't guarantee how much longer I'll last
Without You I'm a hopeless wreck
So I cry out Your name as I drop to the deck

Don't get me started, don't even get me started
Don't get me started, don't even get me started

I'm Yours
Take me as I am
I'm Yours
So take this space between us and fill it up again
I'm Yours
Take me as I am
I'm Yours
So take this space between us and fill it up again

Simple minded little punk
Thought I was the junk
Nobody ever told me that my doo-doo stunk
What was I out of my mind
Or was I just trippin' on an ego
But You filled up the space and You never let me go
Bullseye to the center of my soul
One shot but it rocked like a fatal blow
This love was Your gun, mercy Your shells
Now I'm a dead man walkin' down a skinny trail

I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops
Give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops
So you can take your best shot
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops
Give it all I got
Shout it from the rooftops
Like it or not

I'm a dead man walkin'
I'm a dead man walkin' down the boulevard"
