"1" "Let There Be Light
Stryper

On the first day he made heaven
Then earth and said let there be light
Then he separated the water from the sky
The ground becomes land
And waters became the seas
He was pleased
Trees would take root, and live to bear fruit

Let there be light day and a night
Stars shining bright let there be light

And then upon the fifth day
Fish would swim and birds could fly
Land bearing creatures
All according to their kind
And so it shall be
A man and a woman after thee
And he was pleased
Soon they'll increase and rule every beast

Let there be light day and a night
Stars shining bright let there be light!

Let there be light day and a night
Stars shining bright let there be light!
