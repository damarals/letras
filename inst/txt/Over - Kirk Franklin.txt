"1" "Over
Kirk Franklin

It's not over
If you've got air to breathe
It's not over
Don't believe everything you see
You're a fighter
Weapons from somewhere higher
They light up when you're closer
If God says it's not over
Get up 'cause it's not over
(Yeah get up, get up, get up)
Get up 'cause it's not over
(Yeah get up, get up, get up)

It's not over
Please tell that to the weight upon my shoulder
If joy comes in the morning how much longer
Do I knock on Heaven's door 'cause it won't open
Can't breathe, too broken to believe

See I know that you've been here before but
But if you look closer
The thing that didn't kill you made you stronger
That's why it's not over

It's not over
If you've got air to breathe
It's not over
Don't believe everything you see
You're a fighter
Weapons from somewhere higher
They light up when you're closer
If God says it's not over
Get up 'cause it's not over
(Yeah get up, get up, get up, get up)
Get up 'cause it's not over
(Yeah get up, get up, get up, get up)

Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
You're running but you don't know where you're headed
The prize is never greater than the lesson
The cross you carried really was your blessing
So breathe
Can't fight what you can't see
(Come on)

See I know that you've been here before but
But look see you made it
All the nights you hated
They just made you stronger
That's why it's not over

There was a time I thought my chance was gone
When the rain stopped I knew I'd make it home
I feel better

(Hello it's not over)
When the bags are packed and it's looking like the end
(Hello it's not over)
When you pray every time you pull up to the Atm
(Hello it's not over)
When your enemy turns out to be your best friend
(Hello it's not over)
Give thanks 'cause after each storm new life begins

See your job and that money
It's just a resource
God is your source
And the Source wants you to know

It's not over
If you've got air to breathe
It's not over
Don't believe everything you see
You're a fighter
Weapons from somewhere higher
They light up when you're closer
If God says it's not over
Get up 'cause it's not over
(Yeah get up, get up, get up, get up)
Get up 'cause it's not over
(Yeah get up, get up, get up, get up)
Get up 'cause it's not over
(Yeah get up, get up, get up, get up)
Get up 'cause it's not over
(Yeah get up, get up, get up, get up)

Get up 'cause it's not over
Get up 'cause it's not over
Get up 'cause it's not over
Get up 'cause it's not over"
