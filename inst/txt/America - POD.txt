This is America
P.O.D and Santana
Live in la casa
Live and direct
To you and yours
Your America

Was it the way that she looked at me
She had caught my eye
She stole my heart she freed my mind
The way we loved it was magical
Truly wonderful
It was me and you so beautiful
And I know that you feel this too
Will our dreams come true
I believe in you
Show me the way to a better day
Was the price to pay if I follow you

America, America
Will you come back to me baby
Please don't run away don't let me go
America, America
Can you get back to me baby
Please don't run away I need you so

I trust in you still you walked away
You just ran away
I thought our love would never change
The way you move had me hypnotized
Now I realize
I fell again the same old lies

Glad you've changed the present we arranged
If we don't know the past the future we cannot change
So I maintained dealt my hand so I deal with it
Know what is truth myself I stay real with it
