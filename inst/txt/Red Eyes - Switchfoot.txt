"1" "Red Eyes
Switchfoot

what are you waiting for,
the day is gone?
I said I'm waiting for dawn

what are you aiming for
out here alone?
I said I'm aiming for home

holding on, holding on
â€¨
with red eyes
What are you looking for?
with red eyes
red eyes

all of my days are spent
within this skin
within this cage that I'm in

nowhere feels safe to me
nowhere feels home
even in crowds I'm alone

holding on, holding on

every now and then I see you dreaming
every now and then I see you cry
every now and then I see you reaching,
reaching for the other side
what are you waiting for?
