"1" "I Turn To You (Radio Edit)
Selah

When I'm far away from home
And the cold wind starts to blow
When I'm empty and alone
I turn to You

When there's hardness in my heart
And I can't see the truth
And I'm wondering in the dark
I turn to You

PRE-CHORUS:
And here in Your holy presence
It's all that I can do

CHORUS
I turn to You, Jesus
I turn to You, Lord
What else can I do, Jesus
I turn to You

For the faith to move ahead
And to let go of the past
And to see me as You do
I turn to You

REPEAT PRE-CHORUS & CHORUS

BRIDGE:
You alone are worthy
The one and only God
The Ruler of the nations
And Father of my heart

REPEAT CHORUS

Help me turn to You
Help me turn to You"
