CAN'T NOBODY STOP ME NOW
'CAUSE I'M A PART OF THE ARMY NOW
PRAISE THE LORD IS WHAT I WANNA SHOUT
EVEN IN A CROWD I'M GONNA SING IT LOUD

YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE
BUT I KNOW WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME
EVERY DAY I CAN FEEL HIS POWER
'CAUSE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD
HE LIFTS ME HIGHER

ALL THE WORLD, CAN'T STOP, CAN'T STOP HIM
ALL THE WORLD, CAN'T STOP, CAN'T STOP HIM NOW

MY GOD IS THE STRONGEST TOWER
TURN TO HIM IN THE SCARY HOUR
EVEN WHEN IT GETS HARDER NOW
ALL I WANNA DO IS JUST PRAISE HIM LOUDER

KEEP SINGING 'TIL MY VOICE RUN OUT
KEEP RUNNING 'TIL HE LIFTS ME OUT
KEEP SINGING IT 'CAUSE I CAN'T STOP
OH, I CAN'T STOP

YOU GOT TO GIVE YOUR SELF UP
YOU GOT TO LOSE YOUR PRIDE
YOU GOT TO SEE IT DIFFERENT
OPEN UP YOUR SPIRITUAL EYES

THE DEVIL WANTS YOU BEATEN
HE WANTS YOU LYING CHEATING
BUT THAT WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER
MY DAD IS BIGGER, STRONGER

SOUND OFF 1, 2 SOUND OFF, 3, 4
BRING IT ON DOWN, 1, 2, 3, 4... 1, 2 ... 3, 4"
