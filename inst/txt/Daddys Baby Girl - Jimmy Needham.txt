"1" "Daddy's Baby Girl
Jimmy Needham

They said you have me wrapped around your finger
Like the ribbons that you wear in your hair
Maybe 'cause when I see your little fingers holdin? onto mine
I don't have a care
You've got me buyin? you bows and dresses
Oh, what a beautiful mess that this is

I think I'm in love
She's two foot three
Eyes blue and green
I just can't get enough
She got my heels over my head
Or better yet, she got me movin? to the beat of her drum
And if love were time, I would spend all mine
Just livin? inside her world
'cause she's daddy's baby girl

They warned that you'd demand all my attention
Not to mention you?re my very first child
It's true I'm spending nearly half an hour
Making faces just to get you to smile
You?ve got me doing these silly little dance moves
I hope this don't make it onto youtube

Soon she'll crawl, then walk, then talk, she's here for a while
Then sweet sixteen, and like a dream, she's down the aisle

I believe I'm in love
She's two foot three
Eyes blue and green
I just can't get enough
She got my heels over my head
Or better yet, she got me movin? to the beat of her drum
And if love were time, I would spend all mine
Livin? inside her world
Cause she's daddy's baby girl

She may leave, but she'll always be my world
'cause she's daddy's baby girl"
