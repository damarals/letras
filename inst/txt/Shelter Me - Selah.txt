"1" "Shelter Me
Selah

The earth can shake the sky come down
The mountains all fall to the ground
But I will fear none of these things
Shelter me Lord underneath your wings

Dark waters rise and thunders pound
The wheels of war are going round
And all the walls are crumbling
Shelter me Lord underneath your wings

(Shelter me Lord)
Hide me underneath you wings
Hide me deep inside your heart
In your refuge cover me
The world can shake
But Lord I'm making you my hiding place

The wind can blow the rain can pour
The deluge breaks the tempest roars
But in the storm my spirit sings
(When you) shelter me Lord underneath your wings

(Shelter me Lord)
Hide me underneath you wings
Hide me deep inside your heart
In your refuge, cover me
The world can shake

But Lord I'm making you my hiding place
Now on the day you call for me
Someday when time, no more shall be
I'll say oh death where is your sting
You shelter me Lord underneath your wings
