"1" "You Gave Your Only-Begotten Son
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

Jehovah, dear Father
There seemed no hope for us
The ransom has given
Hope to ev'ryone!

We give our lives to you
Our best in all we do
And we'll tell others too
That your will might be done

You gave your only Son
And now we sing as one
A song we'll sing forever
For giving us your only Son

Your kindness, your mercy
They draw us close to you
Your great name, your friendship
These we've come to love

But something more than this
Is your most precious gift
He died that we might live
You sent him from above

You gave your only Son
And now we sing as one
A song we'll sing forever
For giving us your only Son

Jehovah, dear Father, we pray in gratitude
We offer our thanks, for giving us your only Son"
