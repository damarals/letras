Third Day

We praise you oh Lord for the love that You give
And the time that You spent on this world for our sins
We lift up Your name in honor and praise
in Jesus we place all our love and our faith

Chorus:
And we know that You are the Saviour
And we know that You are the Son
And we know that You are the Saviour
of everyone

The time is now near when You will appear
When we see Your face and Your voice we will hear
and then we will sing to Jesus the King
The Maker, Creator of everything
