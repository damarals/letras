"1" "Solid Rock
Delirious

There’s a rock that doesn’t move,
It hasn’t moved, it will never move,
Even though the waves come crashing down.
There’s a tower on a hill, its always strong,
It will never shake,
It was standing there before the world began.
There’s a wave that’s coming in,
Washing over this town, it will make or break us, reinvent us,
It’s time to lay me down.

On Christ the solid rock we will stand,
All other ground is sinking sand.
On Christ the solid rock we will stand,
We’ll climb on your back, take us to higher ground.

There’s a song that doesn’t fade,
It never fades it was custom made,
To raise the sons and daughters of this earth.
There’s a sound that’s coming in,
Rushing over this town, it will make or break us, reinvent us; it’s time to lay me down.

My hope is built on nothing less,
Than Jesus blood and righteousness.
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus name.

When darkness seems to veil his face,
I rest on his unchanging grace.
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath his covenant and blood,
Support me in the ‘whelming flood.
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

When the last trumpets voice shall sound,
O then I may in him be found,
Clothed in his righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before his throne."
