"1" "River Lullaby
Amy Grant

Hush now my baby
be still love, don't cry
sleep like you're rocked by the stream
sleep and remember my lullaby and I be with you when you dream

drift on the river that flows through my arms
drift as I'm singing to you
I see a smilling so peacefull and calm
and holding you, I'm smilling too
Here in my arms, safe from all harm,
holding you, I'm smilling too

Hush now my baby
be still, love, don't cry
sleep like you're rocked by the stream
sleep and remember this river lullaby and I'll be with you when you dream
Here in my arms, safe from all harm,
holding you, I'm smilling too

sleep and remember this river lullaby, I'll be with you when you dream (2x)
I'll be with you when you dream..."
