Newsboys

Take my hands, take my feet
Take the music to the street
Hears the prayers, feel the sound
A generation Kingdombound
Great and glorious
Is my Savior

Praises from my mouth
From my heart
For our God who became flesh
For us all
Unto You
I will sing Your praises
Sing forever

Take my will, take my all
Wrap my life around Your call
Set apart to sing Your praise
To live the difference in these days
Great and glorious
Is our Savior

Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing
To sing aloud, sing aloud
Oh, for the glory of my God and King
Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing"
