Selah

We push back the gates
We open the door
Together we come
To meet with you, Lord
Yes, we push back the gates
We open the door
Together we come
Oh, to meet with you, Lord

Here we are at the threshold of glory
Every eye now focused on you
The heart in my chest beats wildly
As each step brings us closer to you
Magnificent One
Merciful Judge
We rejoice and sing in the favor of our God

We push back the gates
We open the door
Together we come
To meet with you, Lord

We push back the gates
We open the door
Together we come
To meet with you, Lord

Here we are at the threshold of glory
Every eye now focused on you
The heart in my chest beats wildly
As each step brings us closer to you

Magnificent One
Merciful Judge
We rejoice and sing in the favor of our God

Omnipotent Love
Almighty Friend
You are always just
You are always good
And your kingdom has no end

Magnificent One
