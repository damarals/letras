"1" "Without Your Love
MercyMe

Of my life
I've been chasing
After
What was out of my reach
Time after time
All that I thought
Mattered
Still left me incomplete
Now I understand
This isn't who I am

I could live my life out loud
Turn this world upside down
But it will never be enough
Without your love I could make the mountains move
Give everything I have for You
But it will never be enough
Without your love
It's hard to believe
Just knowing
That my heart
Is what you came here for
You will never leave
No more working
Or trying
Can make you love me more
There is nothing I can say
Without your love
There is nothing I can do
Without your love
I cannot do anything without you"
