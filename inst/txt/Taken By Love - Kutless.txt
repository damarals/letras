"x"
"1" "Taken By Love
Kutless

The world will fade away
As I lift my hands
A king that's worthy of praise
Is the Great I Am

The joy you've given rings out
As I lift my voice

I'm captivated by your ways so I will worship You

You've taken me by love
You've taken me by grace
You've taken me away
I can't resist because
You've taken my heart

All creation will bow
to the risen king
All of heaven will shout
And the earth will sing

The joy you've given rings out
As I lift my voice

I'm captivated by your ways so I will worship You
