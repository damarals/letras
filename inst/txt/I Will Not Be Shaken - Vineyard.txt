"1" "I Will Not Be Shaken
Vineyard

I will declare my choice to the nations
I will shout for joy in the congregation
I will worship God, worship God
All my days

Those who love the Lord are satisfied
Those who trust in him are justified
I will serve my God, serve my God
All my days

When the nations crumble
The word of the Lord will stay
Kings may rise and fall
His love will endure
Though the strong may stumble
The joy of the Lord is strength

To my soul
I will not be shaken
I will not be moved
I will not be shaken

I will declare my joys to the nation
Hey I will shout for joy to the congregation
I will worship God, worship God
All my days

Those who love the Lord are satisfied
Those who trust in him are justified
I will serve my God, serve my God
All my days

When the nations crumble
The word of the Lord will stay
Kings may rise and fall
His love will endure
Though the strong may stumble
The joy of the Lord is strength

To my soul
I will not be shaken
I will not be moved
I will not be shaken

I will not be shaken
Keep my eyes on you Lord
I will not be moved
Keep my feet on the ride
I will not be shaken
Let him do something to you
I will not be moved
Anywhere you see, and anywhere you look
I will not be shaken
I will not be moved
I will not be shaken"
