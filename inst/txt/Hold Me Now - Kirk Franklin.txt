"x"
"1" "Hold Me Now
Kirk Franklin

The spring of April's gone, the leaves have all turned brown
The children are all grown up and there's no one around
I'm lookin' over my life and all the mistakes I've made
And I'm afraid, afraid

Somebody told me that You would wash all my sins
And cleanse me from the scars that are so deep within
So I'm calling to You, if You can hear me, I don't know how

I was wondering, can You hold me now?

You are the only one that's patient when I fall
Your angels come to save me every time I call
You don't laugh at me when I make mistakes and cry
You're not like man, you understand me

See, people change
One day, they don't like you, the next they do
I wish that everyone could love me just like You
So here I am, this sinful man, peace won't allow

I was wondering, can You hold me now?
I was wondering, can You hold me now?

I know it seems like the storm will never pass
And it seems like the rain will never end
The Red Sea is in front of you
The Pharaoh and his armies behind you

But my brother, if you lift your head up to the sky
God has not forgotten you as His angels will camp around you
For He'll never leave you nor forsake you
His word is true, He did it for me, He'll do it for you

To every broken person that may hear this song
To every boy or girl that feels their smile is gone
I know exactly how it feels to lay in the bed at night
And cry, and cry and cry

Don't you worry, God is faithful and he cares
Among the tears you drop and the pain you feel He's there
When you are weak that's when He's strong
Even though you don't know how

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

God can and He will hold you now
God can and He will hold you now
God can and He will hold you now
Don't you worry He can hold you now"
