"1" "From the Ashes
Red

You don't know what I am
You don't hold the key
Didn't feel me breaking underneath
Tried to pull me under
Drown me with your lie
Hid away the darkness in the
Light burns deeper now

We are fighting to survive (I'll never break)
From the ashes we ignite (Don't fade away)
We live, we die
We fall, we rise

Time will hold the answer
Every season turns
I won't stay here bleeding, suffering
Burning deeper
Sinking under now

We are fighting to survive (I'll never break)
From the ashes we ignite (Don't fade away)
We live, we die, we fall, we rise

We live, we die, we fall, we rise
We rise

We are fighting to survive (I'll never break)
From the ashes we ignite (Don't fade away)
We live, we die, we fall, we rise"
