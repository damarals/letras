"1" "When The Rains Come
Gaither Vocal Band

Mercy drops round us are falling
But for the showers we plead

When the heat dries up the river
The leaves hang limp and dry
All the creek beds cracked and broken
And the aspen starts to die

And when my soul is dry and barren
Panting for the Spirit's rain
So depleted, weak and empty
Every resource used and drained

Then the rains come, oh the rains come
Gentle streams flow down the mountainside
Filling rivers, rushing water
To the valleys, bringing woundrous life

Oh Thou welcome, holy presence
Washing all my dust away
Leave me clean and pure before you
I'm dancing like a child at play

Then the rains come, oh the rains come
Gentle streams flow down the mountainside
Filling rivers, rushing water
To the valleys, bringing woundrous life

Let the rains come, let the rains come
Gentle streams flow down the mountainside
Filling rivers, rushing water
To the valleys, bringing woundrous life

Let the rains come
Let the rains come

Let the rains come
Let the rains come
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Showers of blessings"
