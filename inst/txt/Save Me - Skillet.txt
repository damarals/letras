Skillet

This is the place that no one sees
I don't like to show
(I can't help it)
This is the darkness over me
It's just the world I know
(I can't stand it)

Reachin' for the light
Reachin' from inside
Help me tonight

I'm closer to the edge
Tonight I'm standin' on the ledge
So why won't you reach out your hand
To save (to save) , to save me
Tonight I'm damaged if you dare
Tonight it feels like no one cares
So why can't I come up for air?
Just save (just save) , just save me

What are you waitin' for?
Someone save me

Peel back the skin exposed to you
Take pleasure in the pain
(Please, don't stop it)
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
It ain't easy to open up this way
(I can't help it)

Reachin' for the light
Reachin' from inside
Help me tonight

I'm closer to the edge
Tonight I'm standing on the ledge
So why won't you reach out your hand
To save (to save) , to save me?
Tonight I'm damaged if you dare
Tonight it feels like no one cares
So why can't I come up for air?
Just save (just save) , just save me

What are you waiting for?
Someone save me

Reachin' for the light
Reachin' from inside
Help me tonight

I'm closer to the edge
Tonight I'm standin' on the ledge
So why won't you reach out your hand
To save, to save me?
Tonight I'm damaged if you dare
Tonight it feels like no one cares
So why can't I come up for air?
Just save (just save) , just save me

Tonight I'm closer to the edge
Tonight I'm standin' on the ledge
So why won't you reach out your hand
To save (to save) , to save me

What are you waitin' for?
Someone save me"
