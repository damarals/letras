Vineyard

What love is this I see
You gave Your life for me
Shed blood to set me free
Thank You for Your blood
Thank You for Your blood

How great this sacri Æ’Oce
Your death to me means life
From darkness into light
Thank You for Your blood
Thank You for Your blood

Now I am truly free
Your love amazes me
I see Your hands Your feet
The price You paid for me
King of Calvary"
