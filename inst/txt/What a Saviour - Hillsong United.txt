"1" "What a Saviour
Hillsong United

What a saviour my redeemer
Friend of sinners one like me
Oh what kindness suffered violence
Healed my blindness and set me free

Oh what grace I've found in you my Jesus
That my soul should entertain your greatness
Should this life hold nothing but my saviour
I will praise you
Always

A heaven's glory clothed in mercy
Knew my story yet took my in
Though I'm freedom hope like heaven
Now forgiven I will rise again

Oh what grace I've found in you my Jesus
That my soul should entertain your greatness
Should this life hold nothing but my saviour
I will praise you
Always

Should this life I live
Hold nothing but the cross where Jesus took my shame
Then with arms stretched wide
And my hand held high
My every breath will sing again

Oh what grace I've found in you my Jesus
That my soul should entertain your greatness
Should this life hold nothing but my saviour
I will praise you
Always"
