"1" "You Gave Me Love
Amy Grant

You gave me time
When no one gave me time of day
You looked deep inside
While the rest of the world looked away
You smiled at me
When there weren't just friends everywhere
You gave me love
When nobody gave me a prayer

That's why I call you Savior
That's why I call You friend
'Cause You touched my heart
You touched my soul
And helped me start all over again
That's why I love You Jesus
That's why I'll always care
'Cause You gave me love
When nobody gave me a prayer

You gave me laughter
After I'd cried all my tears
You heard my dreams
While the rest of the world just closed its ears
I looked in Your eyes and I found such tenderness there
'Cause You gave me love
When nobody gave me a prayer

That's why I call you Savior
That's why I call You friend
'Cause You touched my heart
You touched my soul
And helped me start all over again
And that's why I love You Jesus
That's why I'll always care
'Cause You gave me love
When nobody gave me a prayer
Yes He gives us love
When nobody gives us a prayer...
