"1" "He's Watchin' Me
Gaither Vocal Band

He has Jupiter for a pillow, angel choir for a lullaby,
Clouds for a blanket, and the moon is His night-light.
But He don't ever sleep 'cause He's busy watchin' over me.

He rules the universe from His throne on high,
But when I need attention, He is by my side.
He's watchin' me, yes, He's watchin' me.

He's a busy God, but on His list of things to do,
His number one priority is watchin' me and you.
He's taking care of business, feeding birds and making rain.
But He'll stop what He's doing when I speak His name,

'Cause He's watchin'; He's watchin' me.

He might be busy painting rainbows or making demons flee,
But He'll still find the time to make some time for you and me.
There's nothin', oh no, nothin' He would rather do.

Well, He knows when I'm in trouble, He don't miss a thing,
One eye's on that sparrow, and the other one's on me.
He's watchin' me, yes, He's watchin' me.

He's a busy God, but on His list of things to do,
His number one priority is watchin' me and you.
He's taking care of business, feeding birds and making rain.
But He'll stop what He's doing when I speak His name.

He's a busy God, but on His list of things to do,
His number one priority is watchin' me and you.
He's taking care of business, feeding birds and making rain.
But He'll stop what He's doing when I speak His name,

'Cause He's watchin'; He's watchin' me.
Yes, He's watchin', He's watchin' me.
Well, He's watchin', He's watchin' me."
