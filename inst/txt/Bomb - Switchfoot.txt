"x"
"1" "Bomb
Switchfoot

With blankness staring back at me
And gleaming from the pages
I feel the fear of apathy
Gripping me, pushing me on top of everything
In the corner with a view
I turn off the fluorescent tubes

This is the bomb that I've been waiting for
Living for
You've finally lit the fuse that's in my head
Yes, you've finally lit the fuse that's in my head

With nothingness on top of me
Bleeding from my folder
Only you can stop the emptiness
Don't let it take me over

I've been sinking now
Further into nothing
I've been waiting long
Longer than for something
