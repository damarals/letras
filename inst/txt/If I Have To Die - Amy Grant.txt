"1" "If I Have To Die
Amy Grant

Do you have a heavy heart?
'Cause you try to play the part
Of a life that you don't know,
And now it's scaring you?
'Cause you're saying all the right words,
But no one's ever heard
The voice that's crying out
Inside your heart....

Saying, please don't make me die for you.
I've gotta make you see,
That there's a part of me
I never want to lose.
But if I have to die for you,
Somehow let me see,
That you're more than words--
I need a glimpse of you.

But it's Sunday church again.
And the habit to pretend
Is stronger than you knew,
Look how it's ruling you.
But it's friends you try to blame.
Oh, I've done it just the same.
'Cause it's easier than answering to Him.

You think that they're playing games,
And they leave and never act the same,
And you don't want a part of their show.
Yes, you think there's something more,
But not inside these holy doors,
Well, what are you looking for?

Yes, we have to die for Him,
That's the struggle, don't you see?
'Cause it's the hardest thing
You'll ever have to do.
But no, it's not impossible;
He's been waiting so long for you.
But don't be afraid--
He knows the pain,
Because He had to do it
For you, for you....
