"1" "Take Me To Your Leader
Newsboys

Isabelle is a belly dancer with a kleptomaniac's restraint
tried stealing Helena's hand basket,
made a fast getaway, but McQueen she ain't
at the courtroom Joshua judges her ruthlessly
on account of Ruth walking out on him
in the Big House Isabelle is a-telling all to
the chaplain who's become her friend
she says: I don't know why you care
I don't know what's out there
I don't know where or how
just take me to your leader now
take me to your leader now

Justin is adjustin' to the odor from
Theodore's Evergreen Incense
but aroma therapy don't make him any
younger than Oliver's All Liver Supplements
his late mate Merrilee merrily said
immortality can't be bought in a jar
this just in: Justin's had enough of cure-alls,
gonna quiz the neighbor kid with the fish on his car

he says: I don't know why you care
I don't know what's out there
I don't know how it's done
just take me to your leader, son

I see you've got the joy
I've seen you live it, boy
It's real, it's free, it's fun,
so take me to your leader , son

They don't know why we care
They don't know what's out there
They don't know how it's done
Let's Take `Em To Our Leader's Son

They see we've got the joy
They see us live it, oi
it's real, it's free, it's fun,
Let's Take `Em To Our Leader's Son
