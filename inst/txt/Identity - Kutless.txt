Kutless

I've been looking from the outside, outside
I've been walking on a straight line, straight line
Scared to let the world see my failures, who I am, or who I've been

I've been waiting for somebody else to
Take the chance that I am so afraid to
I don't know how to find myself am I the only one the only one

Oh I wanna feel you move me like a river running through me
I am so tired of trying to prove it I'm never gonna do it alone
God I need you to be my identity

It's always easier to hide behind that
Camouflage that keeps our hearts so guarded
But there's no shame when we surrender everything to you
Everything to you

I want to see the world change, see the system cave in
You pull our hearts from the ashes
The cry of the captive is rising"
