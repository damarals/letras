"1" "Prodigal Soul
Switchfoot

The sun comes up alone
Like a funeral for my home
Like a mirror for my soul
But I should've known better
I was feeling like skin and bones
I kept chasing after these ghost
I kept giving up these hopes
When I found your letter

I am Yours and Yours alone
Forgive me for my wandering on my own
I'm a prodigal soul
And I want to come home
I can't make it alone
Won't You bring me home?

Tried to start on something new
Tried to blame myself on You
But my nightmares all came true
I felt so unsteady
I still see Your face when I close my eyes and
I think about You wide awake at night and
How far do I have to go to realize
What I know already

I am Yours and Yours alone
Forgive me for my wandering on my own
I'm a prodigal soul
I was running on empty
I was feeling so low
When You made me a promise
To never let me go
I was falling to pieces
When You carried me home
When You told me you loved me
And my prodigal soul
In my dreams, all is forgiven
In my dreams, I'm by Your side
But when I wake up somethings missing
Can You free me from my prodigal soul?
Won't You bring me home?"
