Skillet

When I was a young boy
I saw a vision of your face
I made a my first promise to you
Yeah ya know it took some time
But I love you now I realize

I am a promise maker
I am a promise breaker

On the road to faithfulness
I sometimes forget your name
But I can still see your face
And time after time
I hear you calling my name
I gotta name for me, I gotta a name,
I gotta name for me, I gotta name

I am the promise maker
I am the promise breaker

On my knees for the last time
I could rip my heart out every day
I made my last promise to you
Yeah I could cry I could cry a million tears a day
And all I would hear you say is

You are the promise taker
You are the promise taker
You are the promise taker
You put them in your promise blender

You took me, and you own me
And you bought me, and you love me
Promise keeper, keeper, keeper
