Stryper

Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Hearts are weeping, soul's are keeping on ice
Spirits dying, wickedness won't suffice
Those who cared, they stop and stare at the wall
Doing nothing, watching prisoners fall
The sun is falling from the sky
The earth is cold and still

[Chorus]
God - have mercy on us
For we know not what we do
God – dark and blinded, we are burning
Without You – God!

Yeah, oh, oh!
Without conscience, without warning at all
We kill the wounded, crushing those who crawl
Can't we see that life, is hung by a thread
In the end our flesh is buried and dead
Mountains crumble, rivers swell
The tide is taking all
[Repeat chorus]"
