"1" "Cry Of The Broken
Hillsong United

Verse 1
Lord I come
Lord I thank you
For your love
For this grace divine

Verse 2
Love and mercy undeserving
You gave it all
The greater sacrifice

Chorus 1
You were wounded for my sins
You were bruised for all my shame
You were broken for my healing
Only by the cross I am saved

Verse3
You're the mender of the broken
To live free outcast
Our friend and conquerer

Chorus 2
I come boldly to your presence
Lord I bow before your throne
You're my healer, my redeemer
You're my hope, my life, my all

Bridge
You hear the cry of the broken

You answer the cry of the broken"
