"1" "Long Time Comin'
Third Day

Words by Mac Powell & Music by Third Day
From the recording: Southern Tracks, Track #1.

Well I've been taking
It all for granted
Everything that I, have been givin'
Now it is the day, to start my mission
It's been a long time a comin'

There are many, searching for answers
Tell me who am I, to keep it to myself?
I've grown weary of my own fears
It's been a long time a comin'

Chorus:
Well I've been running just like an outlaw
And I am willing and able
To give you something that you can believe on
It's been a long time a comin'

True believers,
Have been staring, up into the sky
Waiting for your return
And I know one day
The clouds will roll down
It's been a long time comin'
