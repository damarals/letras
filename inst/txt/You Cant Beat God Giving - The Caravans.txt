"1" "You Can't Beat God Giving
The Caravans

Chorus:
You can't beat God's giving, no matter how you try.
And just as sure as you are living
and the Lord is in heaven on high.
The more you give, the more He give to you,
but keep on giving because it's really true
that you can't beat God's giving,
no matter how you try.

Verse 1:
Should we recieve and never give,
the Savior died that we might live.
His life on Calvary, He gladly gave,
our sinful souls to save.

Chorus

Verse 2:
He gives me health, He keeps me strong,
He guides me when I would go wrong,
He gives me everything that I need,
my ever hunger feeds.

Chorus

Verse 3:
He gave me peace, He made me whole,
and when in sin He saved my soul.
And what I gave would never be compared
with the blessing that I share.

Chorus"
