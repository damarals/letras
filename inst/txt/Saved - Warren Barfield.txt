"x"
"1" "Saved
Warren Barfield

I was drowning, I was drowning in an ocean of sin
I was sinking beyond the hope of ever rising again
But then You reached down, way down in the deep where I was
You stood me up, and there I stood surprised to be loved

Oh You make me so complete
You lift me up
From the inside out, the outside in
I have been saved
I have been saved
I have been saved

It seemed hopeless treading water in a pointless fight
Out of the darkness I was rescued by the brightest light
Now that You got me, Father, please hold on tight
And don’t ever let go, I don’t ever want to go back to my old life

Oh You make me so complete
You lift me up
From the inside out, the outside in
I have been saved
I have been saved
I have been saved
I have been saved

You are my lifeline
You saved me from myself
You have made me new

I was drowning, I was drowning in an ocean of sin
I was sinking beyond the hope of ever rising again"
