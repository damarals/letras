"1" "Come Down
Vineyard

Would You come on down and meet us
Cause You know we need You here
Would You come on down and free us
'Cause You know we need Your freedom

Oh Lord
Would You come on down and change us
Make us more like You
Would You come and walk among us
Cause when You're here, we'll never be the
same

Here You come to us oh God
Here You come to us oh God
(To me)"
