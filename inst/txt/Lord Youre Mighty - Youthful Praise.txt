"1" "Lord You're Mighty
Youthful Praise

Lord you're mighty
Lord you're mighty

[verse 1]
Oh, lord how excellent is your name in all the earth
You set your glory above the heavens and the earth
When I think of all you've made, the sun, the moon and the stars
No praise is high enough to express how great you are

[verse 2]
What a mighty god we serve
Mighty god we serve
Angles would bow before the mighty god we serve
What a mighty god we serve
Mighty god we serve
Let heaven and the earth adore the mighty god we serve

Lord you're mighty
Lord you're mighty

[repeat verse 1]
[repeat verse 2]

Hallelujah (4x)
All glory, all honor
All praise, all praise

To the mighty god we serve
Mighty god we serve
Angles would bow before the mighty god we serve

Lord you're mighty
Lord you're mighty

What a mighty god we serve
What mighty god we serve
Angles would bow before him
What a mighty god we serve..."
