"1" "The Years Go By
Delirious

Looking back across the years
We've had joy, we've had tears
Hand in hand we've run the race
Gratitude for Your grace
Thank You every time You've led us through
Always You are the fire in me

The years go by and still I fly
On wings like eagle's
You take me high where angels cry
Glory forever!

Looking back we had a dream
History we will make
Let the broken let the strong
Live our lives as a song
Thank You You're the one who keeps it true

Always You are the fire in me"
