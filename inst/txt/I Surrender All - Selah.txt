"1" "I Surrender All
Selah

All to Jesus, I surrender
All to Him, I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
In His presence, daily live

And I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee, my blessed Savior
I surrender all

All to Jesus, I surrender
Humbly at His feet, I bow
Worldly pleasures, all forsaken
Take me, Jesus, take me now

And I surrender all
Oh, I surrender all
All to Thee, my blessed Savior
I surrender all, I surrender all"
