"1" "Not Your Kind
P.O.D.

And this is a very uncomfortable situation.
And maybe I look like someone you think you know.
I really don't know where your coming from,
But I'm willing to take you there, where you need to go?

I wish you wouldn't say that to me,
Because I'm not that type of guy.
You really shouldn't play that with me,
And you should know I'm not your kind, your kind.

And please forgive me if I'm out of line,
Sometimes my past, it gets the best of me.
But I know that look and it's in your eyes.
It's not the first, won't be the last time I can't swallow my pride.

I wish you wouldn't say that to me,
Because I'm not that type of guy.
You really shouldn't play that with me,
And you should know I'm not your kind, your kind.

If you wish, I must insist you better get out of my way now
If you resist, then I'll persist, to get you out my way now
And if you wish, then I must persist to get you out of my way
Don't even try to resist. Then I'll persist, to take you off of my list
And get ready for the next man talkin that wooo

Yes I, I'm not hearing what you say
Yes I, I know what I believe
Yes I, It's bigger than you and me
Yes I, I know who I believe
Yes I, Yes I

I wish you wouldn't say that to me,
Because I'm not that type of guy.
You really shouldn't play that with me,
And you should know I'm not your kind, your kind.
And I'm not your kind!
And I'm not your kind!"
