"1" "I Can Hear Your Voice
Michael W. Smith

I'm in the river that flows from Your throne
Water of Life, Water of Life
It covers me and I breathe again
Your love is breath to my soul

Chorus
I Can hear Your voice as You sing over me
It's Your song of hope breathing life into me
I can feel Your touch as I come close to You
And it heals my heart You restore and renew"
