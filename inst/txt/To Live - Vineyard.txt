"1" "To Live
Vineyard

Whatever was
Whatever is to come
I consider loss for the sake of You
All of life can't compare to You

To live is to know You
To die is to gain You
Jesus Youre my sole desire

And what is more
Whatever will be done
I accept the cost of choosing You
All I want is to remain in You

To live is to know You
To die is to gain You
Jesus You're my hope, my prize

To live is to know You
To die is to gain You
Jesus You're my sole desire"
