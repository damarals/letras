"1" "Politics Of Kissing
Amy Grant

She's looking back to see if he's looking at her
They talk without any words
And with a smile he's moving heaven and earth
She dreams of holding him tight
When will the moment be right
Got to be diplomatic, a step at a time
Don't want to blow it baby

Chorus:
That's the politics of kissing
To know when to show your hand
First thoughts then second guessing
A subtle supply and demand
Balance of power baby
To hold or not to hold
That's the politics of kissing
You're finding your way as you go, go, go
How do you know

Head over heels under the moon looking at you
But do you feel it too
And if I move in closer what will you do
Cause I'm thinking please hold me tight
Am I the light in your eyes
I wish you had the power for reading my mind
'Cause I'll never say it to you

(Repeat Chorus)

Oh-oo-oh-oo-oh, oh-oo-oh-oo-oh
Oh-oo-oh-oo-oh, oh-oo-oh-oo-oh
Oh-oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-oh
Oh-oo-oh-oo-oh, oh-oo-oh-oo-oh
Oh-oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-oh
Hear what I'm sayin' to ya

That's the politics of kissing
To know when to show your hand
First thoughts then second guessing
A subtle supply and demand
Balance of power baby
To hold or not to hold
That's the politics of kissing

That's the politics of kissing
To know when to show your hand
First thoughts then second guessing
A subtle supply and demand
Balance of power baby
To hold or not to hold
That's the politics of kissing
