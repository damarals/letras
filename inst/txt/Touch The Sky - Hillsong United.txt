"1" "Touch The Sky
Hillsong United

What fortune lies beyond the stars
Those dazzling heights too vast to climb
I got so high to fall so far
But I found heaven as love swept low

My heart beating
My soul breathing
I found my life when I laid it down

Upward falling
Spirit soaring
I touch the sky when my knees hit the ground

What treasure waits within your scars
This gift of freedom gold can't buy
I bought the world and sold my heart
You traded heaven to have me again

My heart beating
My soul breathing
I found my life when I laid it down

Upward falling
Spirit soaring
I touch the sky when my knees hit the ground

Find me here at your feet again
Everything I am reaching out
I surrender

Come sweep me up in your love again
And my soul will dance
On the wings of forever

Find me here at your feet again
Everything I am reaching out
I surrender

Come sweep me up in your love again
And my soul will dance
On the wings of forever

My heart beating
My soul breathing
I found my life when I laid it down

Upward falling
Spirit soaring
I touch the sky when my knees hit the ground

My heart beating
My soul breathing
I found my life when I laid it down

Upward falling
Spirit soaring
I touch the sky when my knees hit the ground

Find me here at your feet again
Everything I am reaching out
I surrender

Come sweep me up in your love again
And my soul will dance
On the wings of forever

Upward falling
Spirit soaring
I touch the sky when my knees hit the ground"
