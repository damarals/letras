"1" "All Out
Marcos Witt

What can I give to You my King
You have given me every thing
There is only one thing You require
And that's me, my heart, and adoration

(chorus)
All out, all out
I'm going all out for You
With all my heart, mind, and strength
All out for you, Lord

I asked for love and You showed me
The Cross
You laid Your life down that day for me
I asked for hope an You shoed me
The tomb
Empty now
And my heart is filled with Your Spirit

I will not hold back, I will not be silent
About that love that I found
My whole world is changing
I owe it to You, Lord
I'll give You all that I am
All that I am"
