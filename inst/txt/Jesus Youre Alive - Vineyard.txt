"1" "Jesus You're Alive
Vineyard

You are the source of living water
You are the living bread of life
You are the living way before us

And in You we live and move
Because You live, we live in You

Chorus:
Jesus, You're alive
Jesus, You're alive
Jesus, You're alive and
You're alive in me

You are the King of life eternal
You are the living Son of God
You died and rose again to save us

And in You we live and move
Because You live, we live in You"
