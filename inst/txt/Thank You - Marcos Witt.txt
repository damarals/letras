Marcos Witt

Lord, you took me into your arms
And you've shown me trust love
You have given me such mercy
I'm unworthy of
Lord, your mercy everlasting
I could never understand
But for all the love and grace
You've shown, I just want to say
Thank you, thank you, my Lord
Thank you from the bottom of my heart
Lord, I thank you, thank you, dear Lord
Thank you from the bottom of my heart
At the cross you gave your life for me
As a gift of your great love
It was the gift of everlasting life
From above
I can boldly come before your throne
Through your blood I've been set free
I'm going to shout it to the heavens
I've been redeemed!
Thank you, thank you, my Lord
Thank you from the bottom of my heart
Lord, I thank you, thank you, dear Lord
Thank you from the bottom of my heart
Lord, I thank you, thank you, dear Lord
Thank you from the bottom of my heart"
