"1" "God Forbid
P.O.D.

We have cause
To be uneasy
The evil-utionary process
Has begun in a world
That hates you
These secrets revealed
Belong to us
And when worst
Comes to worst
My peoples come first

Too many things
Going wrong around us
Too much to be done
And so little time
We're so used
To bowing down
That we forget how
To stand up
And we settle
For last in line
But not this time

God forbid
That i should lose
Lose my mind
God forbid
Insanity is just
A thought away
God forbid that I
Should lose my mind
God forbid
Balancing the good
That's left in me"
