"1" "If I Ever Needed Grace
Jimmy Needham

It still feels like yesterday
A lifetime of empty days
My hungry heart was desperate for a meal
I feasted on the bread of life
Forgiveness pierced me like a knife
Your breath filled up my lungs and I could feel
I was broke and all I could say was

If I ever needed grace, it's now
You are strong when I am weak, somehow
I am weak enough to see
I need you to cover me
If I ever needed grace, it's now

I met the woman of my dreams
Wanted to give her everything
Then fear came like a thief in the night
But my journal pages prophesy
That one day I'd make her my bride
Soon my best friend was wearing white
With our lives ahead all I could say was

If I ever needed grace, it's now
You are strong when I am weak, somehow
I am weak enough to see
I need you to cover me
If I ever needed grace, it's now

In every joy and pain
Whatever comes my way
God I need your grace

Nine short months 'til she arrived
Little hands and lions eyes
And I'm so scared I don't have what it takes
But I hear your voice sunday morning
Father give me eyes to see
All I need's the power of your name

If I ever needed grace, it's now
You are strong when I am weak, somehow
I am weak enough to see
I need you to cover me
If I ever needed grace
If I ever needed grace
If I ever needed grace, it's now"
