Vineyard

You prepare a table before me
In the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil
And my cup it over flows
With love, peace and joy
With love, peace and joy

Surely goodness and mercy
Will follow me
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
And I will dwell
In the house of the Lord
Forever, forever, forever
Amen"
