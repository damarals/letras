Vineyard

I am captivated
By your love that beckons me
By your grace that is so unfailing
It sets me free
You speak right through to my heart
You speak right through to my heart
You draw me near from afar
You captivate me now I am yours

I was slowly fading
Jesus you then called my name
Stripped away of my shame and failings
You've set me free

I love you lord
So I lift up my voice to sing this to you
You are my God
You are my king"
