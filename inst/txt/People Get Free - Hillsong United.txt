Hillsong United

Verse:
The word of God is planted
and living in my heart
I'm an overcom - er
I live His promise out


PreChorus:
This was not a new thing
until it happened to me
Now I walk in power
I walk in victory


Chorus:
Jesus gave the power to be
all you were meant to be
and people get free


Bridge:
You lose your fears
when you stand in faith
You lose your tears
when you trust His grace
You lose your pain
when you know His touch
Only Christ can turn your bitter
in to sweet and people get free


Ending:
people get free
people get free
people get free"
