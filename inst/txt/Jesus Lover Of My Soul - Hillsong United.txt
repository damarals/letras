"1" "Jesus, Lover Of My Soul
Hillsong United

Worship You my Lord until the very end (4x)

Jesus, Lover of my soul,
Jesus, I will never let You go
You've taken me from the miry clay
You set my feet upon the Rock and now I know

I love You, I need You,
Though my world may fall, I'll never let You go
My Saviour, my closest friend,
I will worship You until the very end"
