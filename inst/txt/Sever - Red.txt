Red

Paralyzed the soul that I bared again
I gave more than I could give
But through your eyes, I saw through the darkness
I died more than I could live

Time won't stop another setting sun
Facing this pain like a loaded gun
I see your heart, who's the broken one?
Alone from the start, alone from the start

Sever these fraying ties
Cannot replace this life forever
Watching your slow demise
With the turning of this knife
I'll sever

Agonize alone in the cold again
I loved more than I could hold
Cauterize, this soul can't be pure again
It hurt more than I could show

Sever these fraying ties
Cannot replace this life forever
Watching your slow demise
With the turning of this knife
I'll sever

With the turning of this knife
With the turning of this knife
With the turning of this knife
You'll sever, I'll sever

Time won't stop another setting sun
Facing this pain like a loaded gun
I see your heart, who's the broken one?
Alone from the start, alone from the start

Sever these fraying ties
Cannot replace this life forever
Watching your slow demise
With the turning of this knife
I'll sever"
