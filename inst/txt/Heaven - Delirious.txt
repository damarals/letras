Delirious

I've walked down a road where the devil's been
Where the kids have seen things they should have never seen
And the ancient stone knows the deeper tale
About a bloody game they call the holy war

That's where I want to be

Heaven is my home
And there'll be no shame

I've walked down a road where the angels been
Where the kids have seen things that we never have seen
And the ancient stone knows the deeper tale
About a bloody king who won the holy war

Heaven is my home
And there'll be no shame to bear

Heaven is my home
And there'll be no refugees

Heaven is my home
And there'll be no shame to bear.
