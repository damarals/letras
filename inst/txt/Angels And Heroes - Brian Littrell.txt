Brian Littrell

Oh yeah, yeah

We are the poets, we are the dreamers
We are the soldiers, we are the screamers
We are the fallen to rise again
We are the lovers, we are the cynics
We the hours, we are the minutes
We are all friends in the end

So why be alive
If you don't follow your every dream
Reach out to heaven
And stand for what you believe

We don't need wings to be angels
We don't need reasons to be right
Your love makes us all better
That's who we really are
Angels and heroes at heart

We are the givers, we are receivers
We are confessors, we are believers
We are the strange familiar face
We are afraid so we follow
We are underpaid and so we borrow
We mind for tears but much too late

So why can't we open our hearts
Open our minds
Forgiving is easy for you will come
If we open our eyes

We don't need wings to be angels
We don't need reasons to be right
Your love makes us all better
That's who we really are

We don't need sleep to be dreamers
we don't need to have tears in our eyes
Your love makes us all better
That's who we really are
Angels and heroes at heart

Oh I know it seems easier to run and hide
And to bury our emotions in the dark of night
But it's worth the fight, worth the fight
Just aim for the light

We don't need wings to be angels
We don't need reasons to be right
Your love makes us all better
That is who we are

We don't need sleep to be dreamers
we don't need to have tears in our eyes
Your love makes us all better
And that's who we are
Angels and heroes"
