"1" "God Of Wonders
Kutless

Lord of all creation
Of water earth and sky
The heavens are your Tabernacle
Glory to the Lord on high

God of wonders beyond our galaxy
You are Holy, Holy
The universe declares your Majesty
And you are holy holy

Lord of Heaven and Earth
Lord of Heaven and Earth

Early in the morning
I will celebrate the light
When i stumble in the darkness
I will call your name by night

Hallelujah to the lord of heaven and earth (repeat)

You're wonderful, so wonderful Lord
So wonderful Lord

The universe declares your Majesty
And you are holy
You are Holy
