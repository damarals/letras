Hillsong United

A saviour on a hill, dying for my shame, could this be true?
Defies the world I see, yet this is all my heart was longing for.
To know you my Lord, to know you more.

You deserve, You deserve, You deserve all the praise.

The heavens wept for you, the earth cried out, 'could He be the one? '
For you so loved the world, you gave your only son, to say I love you so.
Oh how I love you so.

You deserve, You deserve, You deserve all the praise.

Hallelujah to the king, Hallelujah we will sing forever.

And all humanity, aches to find this beautiful love you give.
We come to you again, to offer up our lives to worship you alone, to worship you alone."
