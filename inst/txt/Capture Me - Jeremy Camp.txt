Jeremy Camp

You search inside the deepest parts
You radiate the darkness in my heart
Oh, I can't hide no more
You took this life that once was frail
And gave a strength where hopelessness won't prevail
And there's life more abundantly

Your beauty Lord I know it captures me
Your sweet embrace it brings me to my knees
Oh you capture me, oh Lord you capture me

You opened up my heart and made a home in me
You lifted up the weight the world has placed on me
Oh you capture me, oh Lord you capture me

You brought me joy that words can't speak
You gave a truth where lies will never reach
I won't fight no more
You gave me peace from this life of fear
Never alone at every grasp you were near
Now there's life more abundantly

Your beauty Lord I know it captures me
Your sweet embrace it brings me to my knees
Oh, you capture me, oh Lord you capture me

You opened up my heart and made a home in me
You lifted up the weight the world has placed on me
Oh, you capture me, oh Lord you capture me

I can feel your touch, I can feel Your heart
And your fullness flowing over
Your waves of mercy over me

Your beauty Lord I know it captures me
Your sweet embrace it brings me to my knees
Oh, the love you show it pours all over me
Oh, you capture me, oh Lord you capture me

You opened up my heart and made a home in me
You lifted up the weight the world has placed on me
Oh, you capture me, oh Lord you capture me now
I can feel Your touch, I can feel Your heart
Oh, Your beauty Lord I know it captures me
I can feel Your touch, I can feel Your heart
Your beauty Lord I know it captures me"
