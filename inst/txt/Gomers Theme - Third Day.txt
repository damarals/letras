Third Day

Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day

From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #12.

In this place Saw her face
He was more than happier
Made for Him It's a sin
That she was not faithful

She couldn't be
Foolishly More unfaithful if she tried
He did not care
Wanted her Despite lies and wandering eyes
He deserves the very best
But he loves her none the less

She's forgotten her first love (Maybe one day she'll return)
He's forgotten that she ever went away and broke his heart

Lavished on Silver, gold, and anything she needed
Wasted thoughts Broken hearts
Love was not acknowledged

God only knows
That He has shown her
More love than she deserves
There will come a time
When she will find
That he's not there To give her love
"
