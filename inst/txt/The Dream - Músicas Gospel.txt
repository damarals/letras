"1" "The Dream
MÃºsicas Gospel

Because of the things I saw,
I woke up from a bad dream,
There were tears in my eyes,
A neighbor heard my scream.

I'd climbed the stairs to heaven,
I was in front of the golden gates.
When they couldn't find my name,
I knew what would be my fate.

Chorus:
The Lord looked down at me,
Then he said so lovingly.
I'd like to help you my son,
And erase all you have done.
But on the day you had died,
You still had foolish pride.
When I'm not asked to forgive,
I can't forgive how you lived.

A big hole then opened up,
And I saw a lot of flames.
There was none of the beauty,
From the way I just came.

All I saw was pitiful souls,
Every one was in misery.
That is when I woke up,
Did God send the dream to me?

Chorus:
The Lord looked down at me,
Then he said so lovingly.
I'd like to help you my son,
And erase all you have done.
But on the day you had died,
You still had foolish pride.
When I'm not asked to forgive,
I can't forgive how you lived.

When I'm not asked to forgive,
I can't forgive how you lived."
