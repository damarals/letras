Chris Tomlin

In our hearts lord
In this nation
Awakening

Holy spirit
We desire
Awakening

Chorus:
For you and you alone
Awake my soul
Awake my soul and sing

For the world you love
Your will be done
Let your will be done in me

In your presence
In your power
Awakening

For this moment
For this hour
Awakening

Bridge:
Like the rising sun that shines
From the darkness comes a light
I hear your voice and
This is my awakening

Like the rising sun that shines
Awake my soul
Awake my soul to sing

From the darkness comes a light
Awake my soul
Awake my soul to sing

Only you can raise a life
Awake my soul
Awake my soul to sing"
