"1" "You're In My Heart
Hillsong United

You have me by the heart
Wrapped around Your finger sweet
I've tasted of Your love
Now all I want is more of You

Chorus:
You're in my heart all the time
I live 'cause You live in me
You're in my world
I'm complete
I live 'cause You live in me

Verse 2:
No other love like this
On my knees I kiss Your feet
One moment I can't endure
If You're not near
If You're not near


Bridge:
I love You for all that You are
Not for the way that You give
Every day I live I am Yours
Every day I live"
