"1" "King Of Kings
Hillsong United

King of Kings, Lord of Lords
Jesus the Son of God is glorified
Prince of Peace, Holy One
Jesus the Son of God is glorified

He is risen to
the Father's right hand
Now seated on the throne
All authority in Heaven and on earth
Is given to His Name
The Name of the Lord

He's exalted above
the heavens and the earth
And every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
The Name above all names
The Name of the Lord"
