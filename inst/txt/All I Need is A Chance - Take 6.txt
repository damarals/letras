"1" "All I Need (is A Chance)
Take 6

Where did I go wrong
It alwais seemed that I could make it alone
I guess you live and you learn
That you'll always fall if you don't take a stand

Channel:
Now I'm standing
In need of Your love and Your power to save
So I'm saying
I know I was wrong so don't turn away

Chorus:
All I need is a chance I've made up my mind
Please take my hand
Now I see I can't live without You
Let's start again this time I'll be true

Funny how things change
You never know just what tomorrow will bring
One thing stays the same
Day after day Your love will remain

Channel

Chorus

So I pledge all my heart
All of my time is Yours for the taking
All I ask is one more chance

Chorus"
