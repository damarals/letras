"1" "You Are My Shelter
Vineyard

You are my shelter
Providing comfort rest and peace
The gentle Shepherd of Your sheep
You hold me tightly
Keeping me from any harm
There's so much comfort in Your arms

You are like no other
Faithful in all You do
You are like no other
And I will trust in You

Your calming voice
Assures my strength to live each day
Fear and doubts are washed away
Your unchanging nature
Sustains me in uncertainty
Enduring faith for things unseen"
