"1" "The Breaker's Valley
For Today

Sick and tired
Trapped
Body wrapped with sharp pain because my
Body wasn't made to contain all this rage
My mind wasn't made
My eyes weren't made

My soul was not made to behold
what shackles my soul now
Bound by memories of being innocent
Uncle sinning against me sexually

Momma knew he was molesting me
smacking me across my face. I could do nothing
Pops wasn't around to give me the time of day
All I wanted was a time and place where I could be loved

A hug from my mom was too much
So I turned to lust on the net while I was
Hooked like a fish as I click, click
clicked to watch porn flicks

Trying to find intimacy
Or an outlet at least
But as I try to breathe and be at ease
I see my mom in hell and the devil's
breath through the glass pipe I'm shattered in a flash
Fright and brokenness is the aftermath
Brokenness is my aftermath"
