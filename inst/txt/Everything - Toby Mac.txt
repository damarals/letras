Toby Mac

I'm captivated, I'll say it
I'm on a whole new intrigue
My space invaded, upgraded
I hear You talking to me
It's in the boom of the thunder, it's in the cool of the rain
And I'll say I don't ever want to get away

Tonight is beautiful
It's got my mind on You
And everywhere I turn is a reminder

I see You in everything, all day
And every beat of my heart keeps reminding me
I see You in every little thing, all day
No matter where I go I know Your love is finding me
I see You in everything
You're all up in everything

My soul's awaken
I'm taken by all the beauty You bring
You got it blarin', I'm starin'
Love watching You do Your thing
There's no mistaken Your style
No mistaken Your touch
I see the grand, I see the subtle of Your love

Lord, I see You in everything, all day
And every beat of my heart keeps reminding me
I see You in every little thing, all day
No matter where I go I know Your love is finding me
It's finding me in everything, all day
And every beat of my heart keeps reminding me
I see You in every little thing, all day
No matter where I go I know Your love is finding me

Tonight is beautiful
It's got my mind on You
And everywhere I turn is a reminder
From the sparkle in her eyes to the starlit open skies
You bring my heart to life, fill me with wonder

Oh, I can see Your love, Your love in everything
And that's why You'll always be my everything
Yeah, I can see Your love, Your love in everything
And that's why You'll always be my everything"
