Hillsong United

Verse 1
Oh you bring hope to the hopeless
And light to those in the darkness
and death to life
now i'm alive

Oh you give peace to the restless
And joy to homes that are broken
I see you now
In you i'm found

Chorus 1
And You opened the door for me
and You laid down your life to set me free
All that i am will serve you Lord

Verse 2
Oh You fill those who are empty
And rescue those in the valley
and through it all
You calm my soul

Oh You find me in my weakness
and heal the wounds of my heartache
I worship You
in spirit and truth

Chorus 2
And You opened my eyes to see
all the wonder and awe of Christ in me
Jesus You're everything i need

Bridge
All honour
All glory
All praise to you"
