"1" "First Day In Heaven
Gaither Vocal Band

Chorus

Well it's a great, great morning
Your first day in Heaven
When you stroll down the golden avenue.
There are mansions left and right
And you're thrilled at every sight
And the saints are always smiling saying \"How do you do?\"
Oh it's a great, great morning
You're first day in Heaven
When you realize your worrying day are through.
You'll be glad you were not idol
Took time to read your bible
It's a great morning for you.

I had a dream, I must confess, I hated to awake.
He dreamt he was an angel at the great pearly gates.
Saint Peter said \"Well hello there, where have you been?
We've got your mansion ready so come right in.\"
And then he ranged for an angel to act as a guide.
He spread his wings a time or two and then let me fly.

Repeat Chorus

Well it's a great, great morning
Your first day in Heaven
When you're strolling down the golden avenue.
There are mansions left and right
And you're thrilled at every sight
And the saints are always smiling saying \"How do you do?\"
Oh it's a great, great morning
You're first day in Heaven
When you realize your worrying day are through.
You'll be glad you were not idol
Took time to read your bible

It's a great morning,
A great morning,
What a happy day"
