"1" "All We Need Is Need
Jimmy Needham

I was just a good kid
Hope someday to be a pastor
Watch my language
Memorize verse and chapter
But is that really what you're after?

Well I had my hands full
Couldn't take what you were giving
In my household
There wasn't space for you to live in
What's it take to be forgiven?

Doing my best just to hide my mess
But all we need is need
Working so hard on my righteousness
But all we need is need
You want a heart that's open
A hallelujah that's broken
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
All we need is need

We all get so dressed up
Thinking maybe we'll impress you
At our best we're messed up
There ain't nothing that we can do
It's what we get not what we give you

So come on mercy
Lead the way to the father
We are thirsty
Fill us with living water
The less we have the more you offer

There's nothing we can do
We need you, yes we do
We need you
We need you
We need"
