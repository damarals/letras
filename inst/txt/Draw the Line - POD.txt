"1" "Draw the Line
P.O.D.

Brothers and Sisters
We're gonna draw the line to forget about the problems abroad
But, in the end, we all have problems of our own
Gangs, Crack, Racism, and many people don't have hope
It probably don't matter much to you
In the struggles, the time that we live
But, you don't know your future, so you better take time to give
Who's gonna draw the line?
We're gonna draw the line
Together, forever and ever
You must be thinking, I can't do a thing
But look at me, I help when I sing
Where man can make a difference
Like Ceasar Chaves and Doctor King
We all have the ability to release a positive capability
Where the youth is our responsibility
It's time to take a stand
Who's gonna draw the line?
We're gonna draw the line
Together, forever and ever
Brothers and sisters
Where gonna draw the line to make people change
Yo I'm optimistic, down with positivity
But yo I'm realistic, this line will be drawn over night
This is a struggle so prepare to fight
Who's gonna draw the line?
We're gonna draw the line
Together, forever and ever"
