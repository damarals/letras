"1" "You Are My God
Jesus Culture

You are my God, You are my King
To You alone my heart does sing

You are all I ever wanted
You are all I ever needed
You are my God, and You're my King

And You are always faithful and true
And You have given me life and placed by Your side forever

All my days I will live
To seek Your face
To know Your heart"
