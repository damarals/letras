"1" "I Am God
Kirk Franklin

Toby Mac, turn it up
Kirk, gon' get his white boy on
God, I know You up to something
I can see it all right now
You pulling back my covers
It's getting crazy, c'mon

Think I'm gonna walk away
You're messing up my life today
This time I refuse to pray
Still You keep calling me

I don't wanna see Your face
The thing I love You erased
Nothing but a empty space
Now I don't know how to be

I know it wasn't right for me
What You liking, what You need
I feel like I'm in surgery
Still You cut deeper

My secrets within
My blanket of sin
Lord, how much longer
'Till You through with me
Please take what You need

Be still and know I am God
Be still and know I am God

Lord, Your ways are not my ways
Everything You don't explain
Something's I don't wanna change
So You keep breaking me

It's like I'm fighting for my life
You hit me with another right
I feel like Jacob in the night
Won't stop 'til You bless me

My flesh and my will
Is Yours not to kill
Breezing myself to You
But living sacrifice is more

Be still and know I am God
Be still and know I am God
Be still and know I am God
Be still and know I am God

If I could I'd fly away from here
But even when I'm far You still are near
I gotta get out, there's no way out
But what if I run, there's nowhere to run
Let go, don't go, gotta go, can't go
No, no, no

You win
I've been trying to do it on my own
But right now I gotta surrender
You know what's best

It's not easy waiting on You
It's not easy believing that You got this together
But without faith it is impossible to please You
So I'ma stand right here
You got me, You got me, You got me

Be still and know I am God
Be still and know I am God
Be still and know I am God
Be still and know I am God

Hallelujah, You God, I'm nothing
You got me"
