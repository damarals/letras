"1" "Comes From Your Heart To Me
Mariana Valad√£o

You are so faithful, my Lord
There is none like you
I want to thank you every day
For your love and true
Don't let me ever forget
That all that I am, all that I have
All that I'll ever be
Comes from your heart to me

I need you, my Lord
I trust you, my Lord
Without you I'm completely lost
I rest in you, my Lord
I wait in you, my Lord
Without you I'm completely lost

Don't let me ever forget
That all that I am, all that I have
All that I'll ever be
Comes from your heart to me

All that I am, all that I have
All that I'll ever be
I give you all of me"
