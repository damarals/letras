MercyMe

Oh Lord have mercy
on this weary soul
come and take me to the river
and make me whole

it's down with the old
up with the new
the hard reset
my life take two

oh Lord have mercy
on this weary soul

I've got a new lease on life
they say you only live once
but I live twice
I've got a new lease on life
I've got a new lease on life
yeah

oh Lord remind me
of who I am
my chains have been shattered
I'm a brand new man
I'm free indeed
I'm dead no more
at my worst
I'm still adored
oh Lord remind me
this is who I am

I've got a new lease on life
they say you only live once
but I live twice
I've got a new lease on life
I've got a new lease on life
yeah

the enemy knows
where I call my home
but he's still trying
to mess up my life
in the meantime
so Lord remind me

I've got a new lease on life
they say you only live once
but I live twice
I've got a new lease on life
I've got a new lease on life
yeah"
