"1" "So Glad
Amy Grant

I had laid some mighty plans,
Thought I held them in my hands.
Then my world began to crumble all away.
I tried to build it back again;
I couldn't bear to see it end,
How it hurt to know You wanted it that way.

And I'm so glad,
Glad to find the reason,
That I'm happy-sad
That You've torn it all away,
And I'm so glad,
Though it hurts to know I'm leaving
Everything I ever thought that I would be.
Once I held it in my hand.
It was a kingdom made of sand.
But now You've blown it all away.
I can't believe that I can say,
That I'm glad.

Long before my plans were made,
I know a master plan was laid,
With a power that superseded my control.
And if that truth could pierce my heart,
I wouldn't wander from the start,
Trying desperately to make it on my own.

And I'm so glad,
Glad to find the reason,
That I'm happy-sad
That You've torn it all away,
And I'm so glad,
Though it hurts to know I'm leaving
Everything I ever thought that I would be.
Once I held it in my hand.
It was a kingdom made of sand.
But now You've blown it all away.
I can't believe that I can say,
That I'm glad.

So glad.
Oh, I'm so glad.
So glad....
Oh, I'm so glad....
Yes, I'm glad....
So very, very glad....

La la la....
La la la....
La, la la, la la, la la, la la....
Da da da....
