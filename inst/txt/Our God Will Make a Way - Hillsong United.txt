"1" "Our God Will Make a Way
Hillsong United

You are Lord overall
The God who holds the stars
In Your hands
You will hold my world

With my hands set on You
Iâ€™m trusting in Your name
All my hope
Is in Christ alone

God Your on our side
You will go before
There is no one like You God

Nothing is impossible
You will never fail
Our God You will make a way
Far above all circumstance
Far above all fear

No eye has seen
No one can know
The fullness of Your love
For You are God
Nothing can contain You

You are my healer
You are my strength
All my hope is in You
You are my savior
You are my peace
All my trust is in You"
