"1" "Greatness Of Our God
Hillsong United

(Verse 1)
Give me eyes to see
More of who You are
May what I behold
Still my anxious heart
Take what I have known
And break it all apart
You my God are greater still

(Chorus)
No sky contains
No doubt restrains
All You are
The greatness of our God

I spend my life to know
And Iâ€™m far from close
To all You are
The greatness of our God
To all You are
The greatness of our God

(Verse 2)
Give me grace to see
Beyond this moment here
To believe that there
Is nothing left to fear
That You alone are high above it all
You my God are greater still

(Bridge)
And there is nothing
That could ever separate us
There is nothing that could ever
Separate if from Your love
No life no death of this I am convinced
You my God are greater still

(Verse 3)
And no words could say
Or songs convey
All you are"
