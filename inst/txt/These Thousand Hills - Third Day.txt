"1" "These Thousand Hills
Third Day

These thousand hills roll ever on
Footprints of a mighty God
They bring me to my knees in praise
Amazing love amazing grace

Was on a hill my Savior died
A broken heart and bleeding side
Hill of the Skull, Mount Calvary
The blood He shed, He shed for me

When Heaven's hills at last I roam
Forever settled in my home
I'll join the saints around your throne
Your kingdom, Lord, rolls ever on

La La La La La La La La ( x7 )

These thousand hills roll ever on
Footprints of a mighty God
They bring me to my knees in praise
Amazing love amazing grace

These thousand hills roll ever on
Ripples of the coming storm
The morning star precedes the dawn
These thousand hills roll ever on

La La La La La La La La ( x7 )
