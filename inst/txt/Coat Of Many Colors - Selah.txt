"1" "Coat Of Many Colors
Selah

Back through the years
I go wondering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
And I recall a box of rags
Someone gave us
And how my mama put those rags to use
There where rags of many colors
And every piece was small
And I didn?t have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together
Sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors

That I was so proud of
As she sewed she told a story
From the bible she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn?t wait to wear it
And mama blessed it with ther kiss
My coat of many colors
That my mama made for me
Made from only rags
But I wore it so proudly

(Chorus)
It?s true we had no money
But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My mama made for me

And so with patches on my britches
And holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
That mama made for me
And oh I couldn?t understand it
For I felt I was rich

And I told them of the love
Mama sewed in every stitch
And all about that story
Mama told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth mode than all their clothes
But they didn?t understand it
And I tried to make them see
One is only poor
Only if they choose to be

(Chorus)
It?s true we had no money
But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My mama made for me
Made just for me"
