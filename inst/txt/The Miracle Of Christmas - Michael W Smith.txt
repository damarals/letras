"1" "The Miracle Of Christmas
Michael W. Smith

A child is born tonight in Bethlehem
His mother holds him close and sings a sweet lullaby
All the world lay sleeping unaware that God Himself has come in the night
The shepherds tremble as the angels sing
And in their song the voice of God speaks peace to the world

A miracle has happened, God has come and God has spoken
But the miracle has only just begun
And the God who spoke is speaking still
And the God who came still comes
And the miracle that happened still happens in the heart that will believe
And receive the miracle of Christmas
So come to Bethlehem again and see

The one who's come to rescue us, our Savior and King
Bring your past, the joy, the sorrow, all your hope to find tomorrow
And hear the words again, fear not and know that God is near
Believe the miracle of Christmas
Will you believe?"
