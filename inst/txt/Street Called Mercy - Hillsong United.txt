"1" "Street Called Mercy
Hillsong United

Tired of endless walking
Not knowing which way to go
I collapsed on a street called Mercy
I was found in you

Throwing your arms around me
You held me like I was yours
Like you've been there the whole time, waiting
I was found in you

Wrapped up in scarlet kindness
You welcomed the sinner home
Now, I breathe in the air of heaven
All I want is you

Keep me within your shadow
Lord, tether my heart to yours
I want nothing without your presence
All I want is you

You are all I want
You are all I need
Every breath I take is a breath to say
I'm yours now, forever

You are all I want
You are all I need
Every breath I take is a breath to say
I'm yours now, forever

Forever and ever
Forever and ever and ever

All I want is you

You are all I want
You are all I need
Every breath I take is a breath to say
I'm yours now, forever

You are all I want
You are all I need
Every breath I take is a breath to say
I'm yours now, forever"
