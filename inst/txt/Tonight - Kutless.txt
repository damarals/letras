"1" "Tonight
Kutless

I hear the voice
Of thousands
All gathered here
Are they just a noise
Soon lost in air
Or is there more
Is there more

You lift your hands up higher
Reaching to the sky
Is there a reason
Can, can you tell me why
Or is there more
Is there more

So let me ask you
Can you feel the music
All around you
Flashing lights
But love can fill your mind
Can you feel the sounds
Of love flow through you
We're praising Him tonight

Can you feel the music
All around you
Flashing lights
But love can fill your mind
Can you feel the sounds
Of love flow through you
We're praising Him tonight

Some say that
It's, it's not right
For us to praise
On, on this type of night
Tonight there's more
There's more

Songs are not just more than empty words
Songs of love sent to our God above
Tonight there's more
There's more

So let me ask you
Can you feel the music
All around you
Flashing lights
But love can fill your mind
Can you feel the sounds
Of love flow through you
We're praising Him tonight
