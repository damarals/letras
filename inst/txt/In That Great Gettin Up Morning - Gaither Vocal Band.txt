Gaither Vocal Band

I'm a-gonna tell you 'bout
The comin' of the judgment,
Fair thee well, fair thee well.
I'm a-gonna tell you 'bout
The comin' of the judgment,
Fair thee well, fair thee well.

There's a better day a-comin',
Fair thee well, fair thee well.
There's a better day a-comin',
Fair thee well, fair thee well.

In that great a-gettin' up morning,
Fair thee well, fair thee well.
In that great a-gettin' up morning,
Fair thee well, fair thee well.

When you see the lightnin' a-flashin',
Fair thee well, fair thee well.
When you hear the thunder a-crashin',
Fair thee well, fair thee well.
When you see the stars a-fallin',
Fair thee well, fair thee well.
When you hear the chariot's callin',
Fair thee well, fair thee well.

In that great a-gettin' up morning,
Fair thee well, fair thee well.
In that great a-gettin' up morning,
Fair thee well, fair thee well.

When you see the lightnin' flashin',
When you hear the thunder crashin',
When you see the stars a-fallin',
When you hear the chariot's callin',

Good news, chariot's a-comin'
Good news, chariot's a-comin'
So glad, chariot's a-comin'
And I don't wan-na be left out!

There's a long white robe in the Heaven's, I know!
Long white robe in the Heaven's, I know,
Long white robe in the Heaven's, I know!

I said, Good news, chariot's a-comin'
Good news, chariot's a-comin'
So glad, chariot's a-comin'
And I don't wanna be left out!

In that great a-gettin' up morning,
Fair thee well, fair thee well.
In that great a-gettin' up morning,
Fair thee well, fair thee well.

In that great a-gettin' up morning,
Fair thee well, fair thee well.
In that great a-gettin' up morning,
Fair thee well, fair thee well."
