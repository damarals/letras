"1" "I Can Only Imagine
Amy Grant

(Verse 1)
I can only imagine what it will be like when I walk by your side
I can only imagine what my eyes will see when your face is looking at me.
(Chorus)
Surrounded by your glory what will my heart feel?
Will I dance for you Jesus? Or in awe of you be still
Will I stand in your presence? Or to my knees will I fall?
Will I sing Hallelujah? Will I be able to speak at all?
Imagine, I can only Imagine
(Verse 2)
I can only Imagine all creation bowed down
The whole universe saying your name out loud
I can only imagine all our broken lives
Resurected in the healing light
(Chorus)
Surrounded by your glory what wil my heart feel?
Will I dance for you Jesus? Or in awe of you be still?
Will I stand in your presence? Or to my knees will I fall?
Will I sing Hallelujah? Will I be able to speak at all?
I can only imagine, I can only Imagine
(Chorus)
Surrounded by forgiveness what will my heart feel?
Will I dance for you Jesus? Or in awe of you be still?
Will I stand in your presence? Or to my knees will I fall?
Will I sing Hallelujah? Will I be able to speak at all?
I can only imagine oh I can only imagine
I can only, I can only, I can only imagine
I can only imagine, Just imagine
I can only imagine, Imagine."
