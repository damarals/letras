"1" "All for You
Red

The shadows start to fall
I'm not gonna let you
Drag me back inside you

Hear the siren call
Yeah, come when I call you
Don't make me come for you

Come when I call you
When I call you
Come when I call you
When I call you

Why was I scared of you?
Why did I let you control my life?
I couldn't see before
That I was living for you, for you, I
I did it all for you

You try to crawl away
I'm gonna take you
Your power, I gave you

Come when I call you
When I call you

Why was I scared of you?
Why did I let you control my life?
I couldn't see before
That I was living for you, for you, I
I did it all for you, you

This entity inside of me
This deepest love, this whore
One thing I promise you
This is an endless war

Why was I scared of you?
Why did I let you control my life?
I couldn't see before
That I was living for you, for you, I
I did it all for you

You, you
I did it all for you"
