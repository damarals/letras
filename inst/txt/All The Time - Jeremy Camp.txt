"x"
"1" "All The Time
Jeremy Camp

With every moment of every day
My heart is aching with words to say
I can't explain it, the way I feel
All that you've given has been so real
I couldn't breathe some, I couldn't breathe
Something more to live
I didn't want none I didn't want
Nothing more than this.

All the time, all the time
You have given me love more than I know
(2x)

My words are wasted when I don't speak
Of all your wonders within our reach
The more you show me your printed hands
To be more grateful, to understand
I couldn't breathe some, I couldn't breathe
Something more to live
I didn't want none I didn't want
None, nothing more than this.

All the time, all the time
You have given me love more than i know
(2x)

The way you've planned it, it's more than i can see
I'll never understand it until i live with you in eternity

All the time, all the time
You have given me love more than i know
(2x)"
