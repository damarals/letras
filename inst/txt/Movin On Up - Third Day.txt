"1" "Movin' On Up
Third Day

Well I was blind
But now I can see
You made a believer
Out of me

Well I was blind
Now I can see
You made a believer
Out of me

(Chorus)
And I'm movin' on up now
I'm gettin out of the darkness
My light shines on
My light shines on
My light shines on

Well I was lost
But now I am found
I believe in you
I've got no doubts

Well I was lost
But now I am found
I believe in you
I've got no doubts

(Chorus)

My light shines on (x4)

Musical interlude

My light shines on (x4)

I'm getting out of darkness
My light shines on (x4)"
