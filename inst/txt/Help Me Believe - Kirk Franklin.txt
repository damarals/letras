"1" "Help Me Believe
Kirk Franklin

\"I just want to write you a letter.
I have to be very honest with you right now.
I don`t really know how to say this...\"

(Verse 1:)
I wanna believe but I'm having a hard time seeing past
what I see right now, I see you right now
I wanna be free but when I try to fly I realize
I don't know how, no one showed me how

Wish I could see that this mess I'm in
will really work out for my good, you said it would
so, if you can hear me, can you give me a sign
cause I don`t feel you like I should, please if you could

my faith is almost gone,
I can't hold on much longer,
take this cup from me

(Chorus A:)
Help me Believe, can I believe
Let Me believe, I wanna believe
I'm no good on my own,
please give me another chance

It`s hard to believe in what I can't see
to give you my will cause you're what`s better for me
you can look in my eyes and see
I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe

(Verse 2:)
(I want you to know)
I wanna believe if I never hear I`m sorry
I can let it go, gotta let you go
cause, it`s killing me, Jesus you know how it feels
cause you've been hurt before, don`t wanna hurt no more

I`m trying to hear you speak,
but my heart is growing weaker,
take this cup from me

(Chorus B:)
Help me Believe, can I Believe
Let me Believe, I wanna Believe
I've been here before
And can't take that hurt again

It`s hard to believe in what I can't see
to give you my will cause you're what`s better for me
you can look in my eyes and see
I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe

(Bridge:)
Believe
Believe

(Verse 3:)
I wanna believe when I close my eyes on this side I'll
wake up with you, more in love with you
and, and finally, you will say my race
it is over and my work is through, cause I believed in you

I know dark nights will come
and some days there'll be no sunshine
and you're too far to see

(Chorus A)
Help me Believe, can I believe
Let Me believe, I wanna believe
I'm no good on my own,
please give me another chance

It`s hard to believe in what I can't see
to give you my will cause you're what`s better for me
you can look in my eyes and see
I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe

Believe, believe, believe, believe
Believe, believe, believe, believe
Believe, believe, believe, believe
Believe, believe, believe, believe

Believe, believe, believe, believe
Believe, believe, believe, believe
Believe, believe, believe, believe
Believe"
