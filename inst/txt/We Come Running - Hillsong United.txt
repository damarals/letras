"1" "We Come Running
Hillsong United

We come running
Ready at the line looking out
Looking out to all that's ahead
When every heart
Confesses your name
We're pressing on towards that day
We're never gonna stop
We're never gonna stop

Letting of every mistake
Throwing off the chains of resistant
All that will remain
A passion for your name
Burning as we run this race
We're never gonna stop
We're never gonna stop
We're never gonna stop
We're never gonna stop

We are running
Chasing after all that you are
We are running
'Cause all that you are
Is all that we want, lord

Every stride is taken in faith
Every step compelled by your grace
We're taking up our cross
No matter what the cost
We give it all to go your way
We're never gonna stop
We're never gonna stop

Onwards we draw towards your light
Desperate we seek to know you more and more
Further we look beyond ourselves
To your love
To your love"
