\"Theres always something in the way.
Theres always something gettting through.
Its not me, its You. Its You.

Sometimes ignorance reads true.
hope is not in what i know.
its not in me, its in You.
Its in You.

Its all i know.
Its all i know.
Its all i know.

i find peace when im confused.
i find hope when im let down.
not in me, in You.
its in You.

Hope to lose myself for good.
i hope to find it in the end.
not in me, in You.
In You.

Its all i know. Its all i know. Its all i know.
In You. in You. Its in You. In You.

Theres always something in the way.
Theres always something getting through.
Its not me. Its You.

Its You. (repeat til end)\""
