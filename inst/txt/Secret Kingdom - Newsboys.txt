"1" "Secret Kingdom
Newsboys

This here comes breaking in
Like brick to glass
Like grace to sin
Gonna kick down walls like West Berlin
Shout an amen
Hug it out, then
This here's gonna lit a fire
Gonna pink slip preaching to the choir
Gonna send us hobbits out of the shire
Here's the theme song
Get your ring on

That there's still propagating
Waiting on a rooftop
Our journey's just begun

Come here, a little bit closer
I want to take you to a secret kingdom
It's here, spinning our world around
Turn it upside down
This here is bigger than show biz
Gonna show us what the Good News really is
This here, spinning our world around
Till we've got no fear

This here won't be contained
By culture, wars
And trendy names
Been there, done that, wore out the t-shirts
Don't need free perks
Don't need knee jerks
This here still wakes the dead
Still gets God's people spirit-led
Gonna put in action all we read
Not all enraged
Just all engaged

Cause that there's still fabricating
Kingdoms out of boxes
We're gonna leave that slum

Come here, a little bit closer
I want to take you to a secret kingdom
It's here, spinning our world around
Turn it upside down
This here is bigger than show biz
Gonna show us what the Good News really is
This here, spinning our world around

This here wants faithfulness, not easy fixes
This here won't shrink to fit no politics, yeah
This here knows whistles make for better mixes

Come here, a little bit closer
I want to take you to a secret kingdom
It's here, spinning our world around
Turn it upside down
This here is bigger than show biz
Gonna show us what the Good News really is
This here, spinning our world around

Come here, a little bit closer
I want to take you to a secret kingdom
It's here, spinning our world around
Turn it upside down
This here is bigger than show biz
Gonna show us what the Good News really is
This here, spinning our world around"
