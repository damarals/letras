"1" "The Holy Supper
Sérgio Lopes

This bread is my body: for you it’s given
Do eat in remembrance of Me
For you a New Testament
Is being firmly set out
Share of it all those who love Me
Before those pains I suffer
In the cross Myself I offer
With you in this place I want to share
This last and holy abide
Until that in heaven we again shall see
We no more in peace will gather
Of this bread to eat

This cup owns my blood
It’s for you I have shed
Drink it in remembrance of Me
For you a New Testament
Is being firmly set out
Share of it all those who love Me
Before those pains I suffer
In the cross Myself I offer
With you in this place I want to share
This last and holy abide
Until that in heaven we again shall see
We no more in peace will gather
This blood to drink"
