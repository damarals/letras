Vineyard

There is a king, a heavenly ruler
Clothed with all power, unending his reign
His heavens stretch out in timeless worship
Every old and new thing lift up his name

We can but wonder at your glory
At the beauty of your reign
The overflowing of your mercy
And give the praise due your name

We will sing out a declaration
Tell of your love, faithful and kind
The blessings we've seen, yes every good thing
Was born of your love, your beautiful mind

Glory to 'the one', oh
Glory to 'the great glorious'"
