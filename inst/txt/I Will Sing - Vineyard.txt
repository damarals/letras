"1" "I Will Sing
Vineyard

I will sing of the love You have for me
I will sing of the love You have for me
Higher than the heavens
Deeper than the sea
Wider than the oceans
Is Your great great love for me
Is Your great great love for me

I will sing of Your goodness
I will tell about Your love
I will shout about Your mercy
I will sing of Your goodness
I will tell about Your love
I will shout about Your mercy

You died for me
You made my blind eyes see
You cleansed me from my sin
And made me clean, from within"
