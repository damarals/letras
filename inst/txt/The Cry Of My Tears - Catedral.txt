"1" "The Cry Of My Tears
Catedral

Theres no doubt in mind
My God I can feel the pain
In my heart I pray for you
I cry alone in the rain

Oh Lord,
Only you can stop
The cry of my tears

Oh Lord,
Only you can stop
The cry of my tears

Theres no end in my life,
My God I love you se much,
Im my heart I pray for you,
I cry alone in the rain,

On Lord,
Only you can stop
The cry of my tears

On Lord,
Only you can stop
The cry of my tears"
