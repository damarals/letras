"1" "All We Need Is Love (Featuring Paul Wright)
Dominic Balli

All we need is love
Yeah it's all we'll ever need
All we need is love
Yeah it's all we need is,
all we need is love

Refr達o:
All we need is all we need is Love
All we need is all we need is Love

If I could talk with tongues of Angels
If I could foretell truth from fabled lies
Restore the broken and disabled
See visions in the night like Daniel saw
I know only love is able
I know only love is able
I know only love is able
It's all we need is,
all we need is love

(Refr達o)
All we need is all we need is Love
All we need is all we need is Love

Speakin to the people in the world and celebrating
Love is the proclamation and Zion's our destination
Love elevatin that love
Celebratin that love
We got to come in one body
one spirit one love
Jah listen to the mercy from the merciful love
Your presence and your person yea it's beautiful
Love will set you free and yes indeed
you can see love last long
when it is strong steady rockin with one love

If I never poses faith like Moses
If I never see the hurt and broken whole
and even if this Babylon prevail
I know only love is able
Of everything that rules nation
I know of only one that cannot fail
I know only love is able
All we need is all we need is love

(Refr達o)
All we need is all we need is Love
All we need is all we need is Love

When this life is over
That our memory would burn love
And our children grown up
They would live and in return love
When we strive and struggle
All we got to do is sing love
And if our brothers fail us
All we need is Love

(Refr達o)
All we need is all we need is Love
All we need is all we need is Love"
