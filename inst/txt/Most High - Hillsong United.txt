Hillsong United

I WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE
I WANT TO KNOW YOUR WAYS
LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE UPON US

I WANT TO KNOW YOUR POWER
COME FILL ME ONCE AGAIN
LIFT ME UP IN YOUR HANDS OF GRACE

PUT A NEW SONG IN MY MOUTH OF PRAISE TO YOU
AND THE WORLD WILL SEE AND FEAR YOUR NAME

WORTHY, WORTHY IS THE LORD
WORTHY, WORTHY IS THE LORD
WORTHY, WORTHY IS THE LORD
