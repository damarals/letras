"1" "A Little Love
MercyMe

Walking with the weight of the world
Moving forward but we're stuck in reverse

Gotta head full of headlines
And a heart full of doubts
But we gotta change tomorrow
Right now

With a little love, love, love
Can bring us all together
Turn the world for better
Just a little love, love, love
Can put a smile on a sad face
Be the bright to a dark day
A little love goes a long way
Oh a little love goes a long long way

Oh take a moment
To notice someone else
What feels like nothing
Might mean the world to them

Throw a stone in the ocean
There's barely a change
But tomorrow it's a tidal wave

With a little love, love, love
Can bring us all together
Turn the world for better
Just a little love, love, love
Can put a smile on a sad face
Be the bright to a dark day
A little love goes a long way
Oh a little love goes a long long way

Love is patient
Love is so so kind
Cause He loved us first we know that
Love is gracious
Love is so divine
Oh the world is gonna know us by our
Love
Gotta stick together
Love
Oh it's gonna get better
Love love
Oh it's gonna get better

With a little love, love, love
Can bring us all together
Turn the world for better
Just a little love, love, love
Can put a smile on a sad face
Be the bright to a dark day
A little love goes a long way
Oh a little love goes a long long way
Just a little love
Goes a long way
Just a little love"
