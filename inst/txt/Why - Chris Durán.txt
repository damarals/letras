Letra Original (Original Song)
Artist: Chris Duran
Song: Why

Why, why did you break my heart ?
Why did you let me down ?
If I really loved you
Why, why did you leave me why ?
Tearing my dreams apart
Oh, why do I love you ?

(tell me Why) Wherever I go I think of you
Whenever you're gone it feels so cruel
And it drives me mad
If I don't have you
Tell me what can I do
And no matter what
I can't stop loving you
Why... Why .. Why ...

Why, why did you steal my heart?
Leaving me with no right
And shattered emotions
Oh, why, what did I mean to you
Do you feel the same I do
Just give me an answer

(tell me Why) Wherever I go I think of you
Whenever you're gone it feels so cruel
And it drives me mad
If I don't have you
Tell me what can I do
And no matter what
I can't stop loving you
Why.... Why ... Why ...

Why, why did you break my heart ?
Why did you let me down ?
If I really loved you"
