"1" "You Are My King (Amazing Love)
Newsboys

I'm forgiven Because You were Forsaken
I'm accepted, you were condemned
I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me
Bcause You died and rose again

Amazing love, how can it be
That you, my king, should die for me?
Amazing love, I know it's true
It's my joy to honor you
In all I do, to honor you

You are my king(2x)
Jesus, You are my king
You are my King"
