"1" "I Surrender To You
Jeremy Camp

Lord, you live in me
You're my best friend
You're the King of kings
The beginning and end
Now that you have my eyes
I see your spirit inside of me

All that I am is for you
My Savior
I live by your word
And surrender to you
Here where I stand in this moment father
My spirit has been renewed
I surrender to you

You hold the key to my life
In your love hand
Always by my side
I offer all that I am
So glad I realize
You are the truth and the light
In my life

Everything I need I find in you
I believe your promises are true
I will lift my burdens up to you
Your loving grace will see me through

I surrender to you"
