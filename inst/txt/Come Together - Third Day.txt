"1" "Come Together
Third Day

You can all call me crazy
For the things that I might say
You can laugh all you want to
I know there will come a day
When we all will come together
And learn to set aside our hate
If we could learn to love our neighbors
Just like we would love ourselves

We've got to come together
'Cause in the end we can make it -- alright
We've got to brave the weather
Through all of the storms
We've got to come together
'Cause in the end we can make it -- alright
We've got to learn to love

You can call me a dreamer
But these dreams will come true
Yes, I am a firm believer
In the things that we can do
If we would all just come together
And let the Lord lead our way
There is nothing that we can't do
There is nothing we can't face
Chorus

And I know that there will come a day
When the Lord will call His own away
To a place that He has made for all of us
But until the day of His return
There's a lesson that we've got to learn
We are brothers and we're sisters
We are one

Chorus 2x
