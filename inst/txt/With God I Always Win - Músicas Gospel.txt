"1" "With God I Always Win
MÃºsicas Gospel

If ever I should fall,
God hears my call.
At times that I'm weak,
He hears what I speak.

At one time I drifted away,
But all I had was bad days.
I became addicted to sin,
'Til I found his love again.

God's my heavenly father,
And he is my best friend.
He sends me his comfort,
With God I always win.

In times of great needs,
Just grab a bible to read.
Say a prayer to the man,
And he'll hold your hand.

He's never rejected my pleas,
I feel he's watching over me.
When I kneel down to pray,
I know he'll hear what I say.

God's my heavenly father,
And he is my best friend.
He sends me his comfort,
With God I always win."
