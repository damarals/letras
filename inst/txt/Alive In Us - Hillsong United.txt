"1" "Alive In Us
Hillsong United

(Verse 1)
Great is Your love
Let the whole Earth sing
Let the whole Earth sing
You reached for us
From on Heaven's throne
When we had no hope

(PreChorus)
You are the way
There is no other

(Chorus)
You rose from death to victory
You reign in life, oh Majesty
Your name be high and lifted up
Jesus, Jesus alive in us

(Verse 2)
You outshine the sun
You are glorious
You are glorious
Lord over all
You have made us new
We owe it all to You

(PreChorus 2)
In everything
Be exalted
(Bridge)
The enemy is under Your feet
We are free
We are free
Death has been defeated by love
You overcome
You overcome"
