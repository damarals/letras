"1" "My Soul Singa
Hillsong United

I lift my eyes
To see Your face
I know my help
Is in Your name
In everything
Held by hands
Of mercy

I will run and not grow weary
I will rise in God my strength
My heart will trust
For all my hope
Is Christ alone

Now my soul sings
Your love it knows no end
Your love it knows no end
Your love it knows no end

I will love for you have loved
I will forgive as you forgive
Your love prevails
You fill my life
With hope again

You reign forever
You reign forever
You are the light unto this world"
