"1" "It Is Well With My Soul
Youthful Praise

When peace like a river attendeth my soul
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot thou hast taught me to say
It is well, it is well with my soul...
~
You can tell someone you love 'em
From the bottom of your heart
And believe that it's the truest thing you've known
And even if you never break the promises you make
The river's gonna keep on rolling on
And if you haven't got a dollar
Not a penny to your name
Somebody's gonna miss you when you're gone
And even if you never find
Just A Little Peace of Mind
The river's gonna keep on rolling on
Keep on rollin' to the ocean
Keep on rollin' to the sea
Keep on rollin' 'till the love we need
Washes over you and me
God's love is like a river
At every turn and every bend
And faith in Him will turn your heart around
'Cause even though we sin,
There's forgiveness in the end
And the river's gonna keep on rollin' on
Keep on rollin' to the ocean
Keep on rollin' to the sea
Keep on rollin' 'till the love we need
Washes over you and me
Keep on rollin' 'till the love we need
Washes over you and me...

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well, with my soul."
