"1" "The One Who Saves
Hillsong United

(Verse 1)
Come join the song, lift your voice
As heaven and earth give praise
Fall to your knees at the feet
Of the Son of The One True God

(Verse 2)
Turn from old ways lift your eyes
For the kingdom of God is here
Open your heart offer all
For Jesus Christ is here
Oh now

(Chorus)
We have found our home, we have found our peace
We have found our rest in the One who Loves
He will light the way, he will lead us home
As we offer all to the One who saves us

(Verse 3)
Call on the Name that is hope
Jesus the Son of God
Lord over all, he is good
And His mercy endures
Always

(Bridge)
His love endures
Forever His love endures
Forever His love endures
Forever and ever"
