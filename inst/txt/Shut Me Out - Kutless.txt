"1" "Shut Me Out
Kutless

Tell me something I don't already know
I know that you can't stand these things I'm preaching
in the streets
But how can I contain the truth I hold inside
With all the hurting people that I see

So I don't mind putting up with you
And all the things you say
I'm not about to stop
Or even change my ways

There's nothing you can say
That will take me away from this life
There's nothing you can do
To shut me up when I'm speaking the truth

You may not like all I have to say
But you can't prove that everything is filled with empty words
I know my life and inside how I've changed
A testimony to the truth I speak

So I don't mind putting up with you
And all the things you say
I'm not about to stop
Or even change my ways

There's nothing you can say
That will take me away from this life
There's nothing you can do
To shut me off, to shut me out when I'm speaking the truth

There's nothing you can say
That will take me away from this life
There's nothing you can do
To shut me up when I'm speaking the truth
There's nothing you can say
That will take me away from this life
There's nothing you can do
To shut me off, to shut me out when I'm speaking the truth"
