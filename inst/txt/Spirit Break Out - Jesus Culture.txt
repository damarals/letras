Jesus Culture

(Refrão)
Spirit break out,
break our walls down
Spirit break out,
heaven come down

Our father, all of heaven roars your name
Sing louder,
let this place erupt with praise
Can you hear it,
the sound of heaven touching earth
The sound of heaven touching earth

(Refrão)
Spirit break out,
break our walls down
Spirit break out,
heaven come down

King Jesus, You're the name we're lifting high
Your Glory, shaking up the earth and skies
Revival, we wanna see your kingdom here
We wanna see your kingdom here"
