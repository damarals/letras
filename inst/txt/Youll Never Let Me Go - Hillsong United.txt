"1" "You'll Never Let Me Go
Hillsong United

Verse 1:
I'm so secure, you're here with me
You stay the same, your love remains here in my heart

Chorus:
So close I believe You're holding me now in your hands I belong,
You'll never let me go(2x)

Verse 2:
You gave Your life in Your endless love
You set me free and show the way
Now I am found

(Chorus)

Bridge:
All along, You were beside me, even when I couldn't tell,
Through the years, You've shown me more of You (more of You)

(Chorus)
"
