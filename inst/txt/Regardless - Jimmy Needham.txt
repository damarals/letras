I've been through the world and back again and back again
And I've found a man that claims that he's your friend
May I go to him and trouble him and trouble him
Until that man sins

Oh, my everything my everything is gone
And I am burdened with all of these afflictions
What he lent to me he also took away
May the name of the LORD be praised

When he saves the day
All the world will say
When he saves the day
All the world will say

Be glorified, be magnified
Our El Shaddai, praise Adonai
We cry HOLY, we cry HOLY, we cry HOLY: ADONAI
(we cry)

How shiny is this statue made of gold
Everyone bow down and worship as you're told
I'll be the antithesis of happiness unless you praise this way
This furnace is the consequence for all who disobey

Well thank you but no, thanks
I'd rather praise my El Shaddai
He's stronger than the strongest man and wiser than the wise
so toss us in and let us perish
from this evil place
but know that the name of the LORD will be praised

When he saves the day
All the world will say
When he saves the day
All the world will say

Be glorified, be magnified
Our El Shaddai, praise Adonai
We cry HOLY, we cry HOLY, we cry HOLY: ADONAI"
