Verse:
Lord I lift Your name on high
Lord I love to sing Your praises
I'm so glad Your in my life
I'm so glad You came to save us

You came from heaven to earth
to show the way
from the earth to the cross
my debt to pay
from the cross to the grave
from the grave to the sky
Lord I lift Your name on high
