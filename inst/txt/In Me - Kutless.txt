Where were you last night when the party was on
Where were you when we all went down to the bar
It seems you have changed from us all
It seems you have changed

You want to know, the differences beteween us
You want to know, why these things have changed
You've got to know the One who lives in me
He lives in me, in me

Only seven days ago
I let go of my life yes I gave it all
I let go of all I use to do and gave it all away

You want to know, the differences beteween us
You want to know, why these things have changed
You've got to know the One who lives in me
He lives in me, in me

He lives in me, in me He lives.....

You want to know, the differences beteween us
You want to know, why these things have changed
You've got to know the One who lives in me
He lives in me, in me

In me, in me
