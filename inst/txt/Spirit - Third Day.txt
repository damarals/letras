Third Day

Oh, lord, fill us with your spirit
Guide us by your presence
How we need you, God
Oh, lord, lead us to your kingdom
Bring us back to freedom
How we need you, God
How we need you, God

Oh, lord, fill us with your spirit
Guide us by your presence
How we need you, God

Oh lord, we will sing your praises
You are our salvation
Be our strength and song
How we need you, God

How we need you, God
How we need you, God
How we need you, God"
