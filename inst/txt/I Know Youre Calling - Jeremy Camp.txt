"1" "I Know You're Calling
Jeremy Camp

A broken image is sometimes what I see
But the hand that made me is the hand that won't leave me
You've begun a good work that only has begun
And you always lead me, lead me to your son

Oh! What I want to know everything you are
What I want to see your will for me
And I know you'll show me

And I know you're calling
And I see your arms stretched wide
And I feel you drawing
Drawing me back again

Another day I can spend with you
You turn the pages telling me what to do
And when I feel like I want to fall again
You always lead me well you lead me to your hand

Oh! What I want to know everything you are
What I want to see your will for me
And I know you'll show me
And I know you'll show me now

And I know you're calling
And I see your arms stretched wide
And I feel you drawing
Drawing me back again

And I know I want everything that you want for me
Help me to understand your ways
And I know I want everything that you want for me today

And I know you're calling
And I see your arms stretched wide
And I feel you drawing
Drawing me back again

And I know you're calling
And I see your arms stretched wide
And I feel you drawing
Drawing me back again

And I know you're calling
And I see your arms stretched wide
And I feel you drawing
Drawing me back again

Drawing me back again"
