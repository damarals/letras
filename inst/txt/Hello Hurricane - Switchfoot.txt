"1" "Hello Hurricane
Switchfoot

Ohhh, ohhhhh
Ohhh, ohhhhh
Ohhh, ohhhhh

I've been watching the skies
They've been turning blood red
Not a doubt in my mind anymore
There's a storm up ahead

- Chorus -
Hello hurricane
You're not enough
Hello hurricane
You can't silence my love
I've got doors and windows boarded up
All your dead end fury is not enough
You can't silence my love

Every thing I have I count as loss
Everything I have is stripped away
Before I started building
I counted up these costs
There's nothing left for you to take away

Hello hurricane
You can't silence my love

I'm a fighter fighting for control
I'm a fighter fighting for my soul
Everything inside of me surrenders
You can't silence my love

Hello hurricane
You can't silence my love
