Kutless

Tears wash the blood off of my face
Why did it have to be this way
I’ve taken the last beating from you
This I promise you

I‘m waiting for the sun to rise
And make the darkness go away
The time has come to say goodbye
And God will help me find a way
Just to let go of the fear

I can’t deny these thoughts of hate
The poison adding to my shame
Forgiveness can’t take scars away
But I forgive you anyway

I had enough
I took too much
But this I swear I will pray for you
I will pray for you"
