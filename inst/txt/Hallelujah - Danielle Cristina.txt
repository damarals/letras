Danielle Cristina

Hallelujah amen, amen
He is the rock on which we stand
To the King of Kings, lift up your hands
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Come on now, stand on your feet
Glorify our Lord and King
Let us sing this song of praise
Lifting up His Holy name

Lift your voice come and look into His eyes
'Cause He is the hope
That's reserved for us all there in paradise

Come on now let's clap our hands
Glorify the son of man
Casting down our worthless pride
You gotta praise the lamb crucified

Lay aside everything you think you need
'Cause He is the one preparing a dwelling
For you and me yeah!

For unto us a child is given and unto us the son is born
To rest upon the throne of David forevermore
And the government shall rest on His shoulder
And it shall know no end

And His name shall be Wonderful, Counselor
Mighty God, Prince of Peace, Holy one
The everlasting Father, the everlasting Father
The Prince of Israel
