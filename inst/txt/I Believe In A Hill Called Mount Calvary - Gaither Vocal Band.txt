"1" "I Believe In A Hill Called Mount Calvary
Gaither Vocal Band

I believe in a hill called mount calvary
I believe whatever the cost
And when time has surrendered
And earth is no more
I'll still cling to the old rugged cross

I believe that this life with its great mysteries
Surely someday will come to an end
But faith will conquer the darkness and death
And will lead at last to my friend

I believe that the Christ
Who was slain on the cross
Has the power to change lives today
For He changed me completely
A new life is mine
And that is why by the cross
I will stay

I believe in a hill called mount calvary
I believe whatever the cost
And when time has surrendered
And earth is no more
I'll still cling to the old rugged cross"
