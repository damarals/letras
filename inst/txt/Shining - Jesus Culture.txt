Jesus Culture

You guide me through the dark
You calm my fearful heart
I will rest in You
You give me perfect peace
Fulfill my deepest need
And I will rest in You

God, shining like the sun
Let Your kingdom come
I want to be with You, in Your presence
I'm here to give You praise
You take my breath away
And now I'm here with You, in your presence

Your kindness draws me in
Now I'm with You once again
And I will rest in You
My God who reigns on high
To You alone I cry
And I will rest in You

You are shining, You are shining
Your light surrounds me, Your light has found me (2x)"
