Brazil


From the four corners of this land
We hear a cry, we hear a prayer
The tears of hope and faith are shed
To bring forth things that are still ahead
We have the promise of revival
The nations wait for it to see
And our inheritance, our country
We declare that all God’s self will be

Brazil, there’s a people here who love you
Brazil, there’s a dream that God has given
We cry out to Him
We believe his faithful plan
Soon He will come to restore you once again

If my people who are called by my holy name
Humble themselves, if they pray,
If they seek my face
If my people who are called by my holy name
Prepare to turn away from their wicked ways
I will hear, I will forgive, I will heal their land"
