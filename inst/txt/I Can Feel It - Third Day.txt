"1" "I Can Feel It
Third Day

I seek the silence through the chaos and the noise
That’s when I’m listening; I want to hear Your voice
Sometimes it softly speaks, a whisper on the wind
Sometimes it’s louder when Your Spirit rushes in


I can feel it all around me
I can feel it all around me

I keep on searching for Your presence in this place
I see your hand at work, I feel Your touch of grace
Sometimes it falls like rain upon this thirsty land
Sometimes You gently stir the heart of every man

I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel Your heartbeat

I pray You’d send Your presence down,
send it down
Fill us with Your Spirit now"
