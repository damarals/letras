"1" "No Matter What
Jeremy Camp

I know that every time
I find the one thing that holds me back inside
I want to tear apart
And bring my selfish pleasures at your feet
Every part of me is an offering,
I will set forth and lay it down at your throne
Because I live for you alone

[CHORUS]
No matter what it takes I will offer,
Everything I am I give to you
Even unto death I will follow,
No matter what the price I will give to you now

I won’t throw this time I have aside,
Your the very prize I have in sight,
You’ve placed this purpose down in me,
And it burns so deep
Let this life I lead bring you all the glory,
I’m entrusted with a gift that I can’t hide
Revive my heart, revive my mind

To live is to really die
I will keep this steady pace,
Until that final day"
