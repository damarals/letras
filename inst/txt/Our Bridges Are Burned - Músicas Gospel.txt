"1" "Our Bridges Are Burned
MÃºsicas Gospel

We're at the end of the road
That'll lead us to God.
His arms are extended
As he smiles and nods.

He knows we're tired, and sees we're weary.
And he is waiting there to lead us home.
He gave us life, And let us choose our paths.
Now he's leading us back where we belong.

It is a time we'll all face,
And our reward is earned.
It's when our journey's end,
And our bridges are burned.

Loved ones shouldn't cry
When it's a time to rejoice.
Because we're joinin' God,
And hearin' his sweet voice.

It is a time we'll all face,
And our reward is earned.
It's when our journey's end,
And our bridges are burned."
