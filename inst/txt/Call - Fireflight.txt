The light behind your eyes
tells me that you've cried
sometime tonight.
I offer down My hand
but without your plans
you cannot hide.

The white snow falls
on my black heart
I can never understand.
I hear You call
it melts my heart
You made me part of Your plan.

I'm pouring out my love
open up your hands
not big enough.
You tried to do it all
it's time for you to fall
you've done enough.

Oh my God I've worked so hard
I've gotten nowhere"
