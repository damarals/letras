"1" "End Of The World
P.O.D.

It feels like the end of the world
What happen to peace here on earth?
It never gets better but worse
It feels like the end of the world to me

The false prophets claim to be the answer (answer)
Misleading us and claiming your name
You can see that all the people, they are dying (dying)
Hear the rumors of war so blow us all away

Famine in the land of your fathers (fathers)
Feel the earth giving birth to the dead
In these tribulations, preach his kingdom
And this is how you know that it's the end (the end)

It feels like the end of the world
What happen to peace here on earth?
It never gets better but worse
It feels like yhe end of the world to me
It feels like the end of the world
Are we getting what we deserve?
So take it for what it is worth
Cause it feels like the end of the world to me"
