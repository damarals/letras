"1" "Saviour's Love
Hillsong United

Jesus I surrender, my hope and my plans
I place my dreams in Your housem in Your hand.
Cause I know who I am in You, no shadow of doubt
Cause it's the life You gave and the life You give
It's my saviour's love for me, so i live my life
And all the world will know, will know.

It's my saviour's love, It's my saviour's love
It's my saviour's love for me

Jesus, now I'm living all the dreams of my heart
I never knew lif ecould be like this, Your faithfulness
Holy is the, holy is the Lord.

It's my saviour's love, It's my saviour's love
It's my saviour's love"
