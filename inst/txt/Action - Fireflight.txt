So many hurting people,
Without a leg to stand on
Theyre reaching out every day
We all like to stare
and we pretend we care
How can we keep on doing nothing?

Can anybody hear me?
Can anybody see me?
Does anyone really understand?

Were looking for some action!
We need something to happen!
No more wasted nights and days!
Were looking for some action!

Hey can you hear them crying,
Will you refuse to listen?
Maybe you have no time
Why would you rather stay
where its warm and safe,
When youve got everything to offer?

Can anybody hear me?
Can anybody see me?
Does anyone really understand?"
