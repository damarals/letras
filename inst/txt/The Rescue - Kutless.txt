"1" "The Rescue
Kutless

I don’t know what’s happening
Everything around me has come
Crashing to the ground
It’s here I see my need
In all the devastation
I’m praying for a miracle, help me to escape
Again

My life is a mass destruction
You’re pulling me from the mess I’m in
You take me away
There’s glass in the air I’m breathing
Somehow my heart keeps beating till
You take me away.

Will you send an angel
A ray of sunlight shining through the
Darkness of my world
It’s falling down on me
You are my salvation
The only one to rescue me from the
Torment that I’m in
Again

Goodbye my hurting
Goodbye my needing
Goodbye my worries
Goodbye to all of my bleeding"
