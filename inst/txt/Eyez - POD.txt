Intro:
When it all goes down / We Will Rise
When it all goes down / We Will Rise
When it all goes down / We Will Rise
When it all goes down / We Will Rise
But you ain't seen / Nothin' Yet

Verse 1:
One vision / Death has risen
To me / His Majesty / The blasphemy is unforgiven
And through this alchemy / Of Calvary / One decision
Eye and eye / Prophesy the truth and destroy the wicked

Millennium rains / Surrender to the guillotine
Last breath / Second death / Sends us to a murder scene
So when I'm gone / Don't you act surprised
(It's goin' down / Right in front of your Eyez!)

PreChorus:
When it all goes down / We will rise
But you ain't seen / Nothin' Yet

Chorus:
(Eyez) This World / (Eyez) Your Life
(Eyez) But you ain't seen / (Eyez) Nothin' Yet

Verse 2:
Awake and scream / All who sleep in the Earth
Hear His voice in the grave / Arise and step forth
And make your stand / While men run for the hills
Fill the valley with blood / And flood the killing fields

And keep laughing now / You gonna regret it then
Cause this the day / God will judge the secrets of men
Mark my words / And don't act surprised
(It's goin' down / Right in front of your Eyez!)

PreChorus:
When it all goes down / We will rise
But you ain't seen / Nothin' Yet

Chorus:
(Eyez) This World / (Eyez) Your Life
(Eyez) But you ain't seen / (Eyez) Nothin' Yet

Bridge:
This will be the last time / You'll see me again
And this will be the last time / You'll ever see me again

Verse 3:
One man is guilty / And one man is not
And you'll answer for yourself / Whether You like it or not
One man lives / And the other man dies
(It's goin' down / Right in front of your Eyez!)

PreChorus:
When it all goes down / We will rise
But you ain't seen / Nothin' Yet

Chorus:
(Eyez) This World / (Eyez) Your Life
(Eyez) But you ain't seen / (Eyez) Nothin' Yet
(Eyez) But you ain't seen / (Eyez) Nothin' Yet
(Eyez) But you ain't seen / (Eyez) Nothin' Yet"
