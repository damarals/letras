"1" "Longin' For Your Touch
Hillsong United

Longing for Your touch
Lord I come to You
Lord I'm reaching for Your love again
Longing for Your touch
I can feel Your love
Lord I'm reaching out to You


Verse:
If I need a friend on whom I can depend
Then Jesus, You will be there for me
If I have a need then all I have to see
Is Jesus, You're always there for me
