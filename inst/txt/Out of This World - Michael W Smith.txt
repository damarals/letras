"1" "Out of This World
Michael W. Smith

Michael W. Smith / Deborah D. Smith / Amy Grant / Beverly Darnall

Take stock of your life
What's wrong and what's right
Empty pockets, got no green
Don't you know sunshine is free
What breaks have you had
Some good and some bad
Wanna go but got no car
Dreaming dreams can take you far
Chorus: You will find that life's worth living
In this world, it's out of this world
With a little love and a little giving
In this world, it's out of this world

Look ot the future
Who's in the picture
Say your love life's just a dream
Still you've got a friend in me

Today, tomorrow
Laughter and sorrow
Gonna be some lows and highs
Might as well enjoy the ride

Chorus
