"1" "Our Faith
MÃºsicas Gospel

When we have nowhere to turn,
It will help someone concerned.
It's strength that comes along,
To let us know we're not alone.

David's faith put down a giant,
And it helped him be defiant.
He had faith in what he'd do,
And his aim was guided true.

Chorus:
Our faith helps guide us right,
And it lights the darkest night.
Our faith will give us strength,
In any battle we must fight.

Moses faith would part the sea,
When others said it couldn't be.
And its miracles has been seen,
Faith can help us see our dreams.

So if life gets you down,
Take time to look around.
If you will say a little prayer,
You might find faith is there.

Chorus:
Our faith helps guide us right,
And it lights the darkest night.
Our faith will give us strength,
In any battle we must fight."
