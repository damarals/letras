Vineyard

Your ways oh lord are good and faithful
No one whose hope is in you
Will ever be put to shame
You turned my sorrow into dancing
You turned my tears to joy

You've given my heart a new song
And my heart can't be silent anymore (oh I can sing)
For I am not afraid to do your will lord
'Cause to live is christ; to die is gain

When I'm afraid you give me shelter
When I am weak you give me strength
I cried for mercy and you healed me
You brought me up from the grave"
