"x"
"1" "Ok
Kirk Franklin

Woke up to a world that is changing
Looking out the window, got me wondering lately
Will we be ok? Will we be ok?
One day I can feel the sun shining
Next day a bullet can leave a momma cryin'
Will she be ok?
Tell me will we be ok?

Life is taking everything that I have
Just to survive

I got twenty-five dollars in my pocket
And I think another ten in my glove compartment
I'm trying so bad not to cry, but it's hard to stop it
But You say all of my needs You promised You got it

So I'm gone be ok
I'm gone be ok (Ok, Ok)
See I gotta remember, that my God is bigger
Than any battle, I'll ever face
So I'm gone be ok

Yeah it's dark right now
But I still see the light
Come on!

Why do we hate one another
When love is the most beautiful color
It takes away the grey
And makes everything ok
Where is the American dream
If only one percent knows what it means
To really be ok
Tell me is that ok?

Life is taking everything that I have
Just to survive

I got twenty-five dollars in my pocket
And I think another ten in my glove compartment
I'm trying so bad not to cry, but it's hard to stop it
But You say all of my needs You promised You got it

So I'm gone be ok
I'm gone be ok (Ok, Ok)
See I gotta remember, that my God is bigger
Than any battle, I'll ever face
So I'm gone be ok

See our God is great
This season of pain it won't last always
Life is taking everything that I have
Just to survive

You got twenty-five dollars in your pocket
And you think another ten in your glove compartment
But that family with no food would trade places with you
Give thanks and don't forget how you got it

So I'm gone be ok
I'm gone be ok (ok, ok)
See I gotta remember, that my God is bigger
Than any battle, I'll ever face
So I'm gone be ok
We gone be ok
And you gone be ok
I'm gone be ok (ok, ok)
So I'm gone be ok"
