Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day

From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #1.

Peace like a river flows within me
Love like a waterfall pours on me
I'll never be alone, can't you see
Peace like a river flows on...
Hope is a fire burning in my soul
Life is eternal with you Lord
Who could ever ask for more
Peace Like a river flows on...

...on, think of all I could have missed
...oh, I just can't get over this

Faith is a light shining down on me
Mercy is a wind blowing over me
The grace of God has set me free
Peace like a river flows on...
