Vineyard

Jesus I fall at the cross
Without You I'm lost in this world
I have no fear of what is to come
You've promised to be by my side

(So) Take my hand
And walk with me through this day
Take my hand and run with me
Forever I will say...

Shine on and have Your glory
Shine on
Shine on and have Your glory
Shine on

Grace set me free, rescued me
With You in my life, I feel love
I will not hide, You're all I desire
You've promised to be by my side"
