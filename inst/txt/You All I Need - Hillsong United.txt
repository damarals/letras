Hillsong United

Your all I need, everything I'd ever hoped for
I found in you, everything I'd ever need
Your all I am, Everything I ever hoped to be
I found it all in you

And all I see, everything I'd ever searched for
I've seen in you, everything I've dreamed
And your spirit leads me on, in the grace of Jesus Christ
This hope that fills my soul

More glory to your name, more power to your name
More majesty, and all Honor
More glory to your name,
Your kingdom comes to reign, In the glory of your name
In the power of your spirt, and glory above.
More glory to your name

Your all I need, everything I'd ever hoped for
I found in you, everything I'd ever need
Your all I am, Everything I ever hoped to be
I found it all in you

And all I see, everything I'd ever searched for
I've seen in you, everything I've dreamed
And your spirit leads me on, in the grace of Jesus Christ
This hope that fills my soul

More glory to your name, more power to your name
More majesty, and all Honor
More glory to your name,
Your kingdom comes to reign, In the glory of your name
In the power of your spirt, and glory above.
More glory to your name.

More glory to your name, more power to your name
More majesty, and all Honor
More glory to your name,
Your kingdom comes to reign, In the glory of your name
In the power of your spirt, and glory above.
More glory to your name

In the power of your spirt, the glory of God
More glory to your name
In the power of your spirt, the glory of God
More glory to your name."
