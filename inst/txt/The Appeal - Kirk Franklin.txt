(Anaysha) Lord, I come broken in this place
(Anaysha) Weak and poor for all I have is Yours, is Yours
(Daphanie) This life, these things they can’t compare to You
(Daphanie) No wealth, no fame can separate the one my heart adores
(Anaysha) Yet we take our eyes off You, we’re blind in reaching for the truth
(Anaysha) And now the whole world cries because it realizes

All:

There is none, quite like You

The earth, the stars, the universe repeat these words so true

Solo:

(Eric) Life begins and life will end with You

All:
Life begins and life will end with You

Solo (Isaac)

When I die what will they say about me
Will the work that I’ve done be enough to help someone when I die
Did I draw men’s hearts to You
At the setting of the sun let me hear You say well done when I die

All:

(Eric) Well Done, well done"
