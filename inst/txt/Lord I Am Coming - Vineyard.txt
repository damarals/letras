"1" "Lord I Am Coming
Vineyard

Listen to my pleading, O Lord
Be merciful and answer me

My heart has heard You say
Come and talk with Me

And my heart responds
And my heart responds

Chorus:
Lord, I am coming
Lord, I am coming
Lord, I am coming to be with You

I've come too far to turn back now
It's Your face that I want to see
My heart has heard You say
Come and talk with Me"
