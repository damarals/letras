"1" "Alive in You
Jesus Culture

From beginning to the end
All my life is in Your hands
This whole world may hold me down
But it can never drown you out
I'm not merely flesh and bone
I was made for something more

You are God
You're the great I am
Breath of life, I breath You in
Even in the fire, I'm alive in You
You are strong in my brokenness
Sovereign over every step
Even in the fire, I'm alive, I'm alive in You

Through the dark, I hear Your voice
Rising up, I will rejoice
For I was lost but now I'm found
'cause even death can't hold You down


You are God
You're the great I am
Breath of life, I breath You in
Even in the fire, I'm alive in You
You are strong in my brokenness
Sovereign over every step
Even in the fire, I'm alive, I'm alive in You

It's no longer I who live
But Christ who lives within me
Christ who lives within me
From beginning to the end
You deserve the glory
You deserve the glory


You are God
You're the great I am
Breath of life, I breath You in
Even in the fire, I'm alive in You
You are strong in my brokenness
Sovereign over every step
Even in the fire, I'm alive
You are God
You're the great I am
Breath of life, I breath You in
Even in the fire, I'm alive in You
You are strong in my brokenness
Sovereign over every step
Even in the fire, I'm alive, I'm alive in You"
