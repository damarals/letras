"1" "Took My Place
Third Day

Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day

From the recording: Time, Track #3.

Lost like a little child
Helpless as a baby
Searchin' desperately to find
Someone who could save me
Then along came from out of nowhere
Precious as the light of day
You gave me something no one could take away
When you took my place

Chained like a prisoner
From the day that I was born
Blamed like a criminal
"
