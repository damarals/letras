Hillsong United

Verse 1:
On the day I called
You answered me
And the hope in
My soul increased

Verse 2:
I lift my hands
And turn my eyes
To the God who heals my heart
And gives me peace

Chorus:
You are more than
My words could ever say
You are Lord over all
Over all my days
I will see this season through
I will fix my eyes on You
Only You
Only You

Verse 3:
I worship You
And lift You high
God forever
Let Your name be glorified

Verse 4:
I lift my voice
And sing Your name
For You gave Your away
To cleanse my sin
And took away my shame

Bridge:
Hallelujah
The Earth will sing
May Your name be glorified"
