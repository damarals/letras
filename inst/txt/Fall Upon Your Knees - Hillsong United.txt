"1" "Fall Upon Your Knees
Hillsong United

He is able to restore
He is able to heal
He is able to reprove
He is able to forgive

Though your spirit may be wounded
Or your heart be filled with grief
The proud will have no hope
But the humble no defeat

Fall upon your knees
Cry out to your maker
He will hear you, cause he's your secret place
Fall upon your knees, bow before your maker
He will deliver you, cause he's your secret place

He gives strength to the weary
He gives power to the weak
When you go to him in secret
And lay surrendered at his feet"
