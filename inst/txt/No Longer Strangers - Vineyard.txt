"1" "No Longer Strangers
Vineyard

Beautifully made
By nature I've fallen
By grace I've been raised
You're calling me I'm coming home
You're calling me I'm coming home

We are no longer strangers to your arms
We are no longer strangers to your arms
By your grace you have saved us
We're no longer strangers
We're no longer strangers to your arms

Once exiled by sin
Separated by my transgressions
Now welcomed in
You're calling me I'm coming home
You're calling me I'm coming home

Father I'm coming home
Though I have wandered far
Your love is reaching out
I'm running to Your arms
I'm running to Your arms

I'm coming home"
