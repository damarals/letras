"x"
"1" "Let You Down
P.O.D.

No one knows what goes on inside of your head
And everything seems to be ok.
And your the same as you've always been (your the same)
If I'd listened, would you have talked to me?

I don't wanna Let You Down,
But I can't even pick up myself.
I only wanted to make you proud,
But I don't think I can do this anymore.

When did this crowded room get so lonely?
And everyone keeps looking at me.
I'm tired (so tired) of faking my life (faking my life)
I'm so tired, I don't wanna feel this way.

I don't wanna Let You Down,
But I can't even pick up myself.
I only wanted to make you proud,
But I don't think I can do this anymore.
(do this anymore)

And you mean more, You mean so much more
And you mean more, You mean so much more
And you mean more, And you mean so much more
And you mean more, And you mean so much more

I don't wanna Let You Down,
But I can't even pick up myself.
I only wanted to make you proud,
But I don't think I can do this anymore."
