"1" "You Know
Vineyard

Into the center of the fallen ages
You moved among us with uncommon grace
And you know we're thirsty, weary and poor
You know

You are acquainted with our suffering
You are familiar with our silent pain
And you know we're searching, with every prayer
You know the brokenness we have to bear

Chorus:
You know the hunger of our generation
You know the lies that we'e been captive of
You know we're longing for a revelation
You know"
