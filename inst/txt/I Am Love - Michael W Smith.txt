"1" "I Am Love
Michael W. Smith

I am not passers by
I am not a white lie
I am not left to die
I am love, I am love

I am not feeling sad
I am not the new fad
I am not quickly mad
I am love, I am love

You can try to hide
You can try to run
But you’ll never run far enough
This is my flesh, this is my blood
And I am love

You can fly up high
You can dig down deep
You can flee to the west
You can flee to the east
But you can’t escape what I’ve done
I am love

I am not standing by
I am not letting go
I am not leaving you
I am love, I am love

I am love
My blood fell like rain
I did not bleed in vain
But from my veins
I am love"
