"1" "I Heard It First On The Radio
Gaither Vocal Band

Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Bible tells me so
And I heard it first on the radio
This love of God so rich and strong
Shall be the saints' and angels' song
And I heard it first on the radio

Amazing grace - how sweet the sound
The lost and lonely can be found
And grace can even save a wretch like me
No other love could make a way
No other love my debt could pay
And I heard it first on the radio

Needing refuge for my soul
When I had no place to go
And I heard it first on the radio
From a life of wasted years
He gave me peace and calmed my fears
And I heard it first on the radio

Had I not heard where would I be
Without this love that lifted me
When I was lost and nothing else would help
Just as I was without one plea
Sweet Jesus came and rescued me
And I heard it first on the radio

Alas, and did my Savior bleed
That captive spirits could be freed
And I heard it first on the radio
My soul has found a resting place
Until I meet Him face to face
And I heard it first on the radio

I love to tell the story true
And those who know still love it, too
Oh, what a precious Friend we have in Him
And when in glory saints will tell
'Twill be the theme they love so well
And we heard it first on the radio

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
And I heard it first on the radio
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
And I heard it first on the radio
I heard it first on the radio
And I heard it first on the radio"
