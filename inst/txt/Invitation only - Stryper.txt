Invitation Only

Am I the only one
Who sees beyond the sky
Am I the only one who dreams

Of other dimensions
Where the living never die
And life is more
Than what it seems

(Chorus)
Invitation Only
Is a place I know
If we're faithful we will see
The Great Unknown

When I look to the ground
It's solid as can be
Yet it does not compare with truth

When I look up
I see The Everlasting Tree
That's been the foundation
Of my youth

(Chorus)
Invitation Only
Is a place I know
If we're faithful we will see
The Great Unknown"
