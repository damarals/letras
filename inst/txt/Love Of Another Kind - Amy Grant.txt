"1" "Love Of Another Kind
Amy Grant

They say love is cruel
They say love is rather fragile
But I've found in You
A love of another kind.

They say love brings hurt
I say love brings healing
Understanding first
It's a love of another kind.

(Bridge)
The love I know
Is a love so few discover
They need to know
Jesus' love is like no other.

They save love won't last
I say love is neverending
Cause in You I have
A love of another kind.

They would change their tune
They would add another measure
If they only knew
This love of another kind.

(Repeat Bridge)
(Repeat Verses)

Love of another kind
The love of another kind
The love of another kind
The love of another, the love of another kind.

Give me love
This is love (this is love)
Another kind, another kind of love.

This is love (this is love)
You need another kind of love
Another kind, another kind of love.
Another kind of love
This is love
Give me love
Another kind, another kind of love.
