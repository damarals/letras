"1" "To a Faraway Friend
Cristina Mel

You're my best friend, I love you
And you're in my prayers
Although being s贸 distant, you're right by my side

The remembrances of the
Happy days we shared
Always bring us close toghether
Your pretty smile in the photos
Sweet moments will live forever

And I miss you s贸 much
It feels like I'm dying
'cause part of me has gone away
Please bring my heart again
I need to herar from youm dear
Please, call me. I will be waiting right here\"
I can't belive I've lost you. still love you
My best friend

When I pass by the places we played all day long
They're s贸 quiet now, I hear no laughter at all
When I'm all alone, I think of the words you said
\"have no fear, kid. I'm right beside you
And no matther the distance
My love for you is forever

An I miss you s贸 much, it feels like I'm dying
'cause part of me has gone away
Please bring my heart again
Dont' you ever doubt me, it's sincere
Talk to the lord about me!
Can't you see I need you, sure miss you
My best friend, still love you"
