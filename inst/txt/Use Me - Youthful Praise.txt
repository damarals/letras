Youthful Praise

Chorus:
If you can use anything Lord, You can use me
If You can use anything Lord, You can use me
Take my hands Lord and my feet
Touch my heart Lord, speak through me
If YOu can use anything Lord, You can use me
(Repeat Chorus)
I remember a story in the Bible days
You took a man called Moses with a rod in his hand
You told Moses, \"Take the rod in your hand,
stretch it forth and walk on dry land\"
If You can use anything Lord, You can use me
(Repeat Chorus)
I remember a story, I remember it well
He took a shepherd boy, David, with a sling in his hand
He took the rock with the sling in his hand
Flung the rock and the giant fell dead
And I know if You can use anything, You can use me
Bridge
Take my hands and my feet
Touch my heart, speak through me
(Repeat Chorus)"
