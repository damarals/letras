"1" "We Won't Stop
Dominic Balli

Towers of babble crumble and fade
Conspire to escort me down to their grave
I see them calling talking my name
Not 'er will I give mine for power and acclaim
Keep my heart humble keep my gaze high
Tripped tempt or stumbled
We choose to ride
And hold that candle high

We won’t stop till our fire frees the night
Our fire’s burning bright oh no no
We won’t stop till we hear that trumpet sound
See that Kingdom crowned oh no no

Temples like rubble are no way to hope
Heights that have fallen can’t lead us home
We are from other just passing by
Awaiting our lover still watching I
Will hold that candle high"
