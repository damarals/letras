"1" "The Bones Of Us
Switchfoot

I met the bones of us in our old backyard
And I dug 'em all up with nothing but an old guitar
And the past starts talking with younger souls
'Bout the dreams that we started off with before we both let go

And it's time to figure out
Time to figure out
Time to figure out this war
Time to figure out
Time to figure out
Figure out who I'm fighting for

Into the unknown
Let's follow this through
I'm fighting for us
But most of all, for you
Our heart's like a flood
That washes us new
I'm fighting for us
But most of all, for you

Most of all, for you
Most of all, for you
Most of all, for you

And the clock moves forward
We let our love get sore
It was one of those arguments, can't remember what the fight was for
I heard the front door slam, and after the aftermath
I saw you smiling back at me from a box of photographs

And it's time to figure out
Time to figure out
Time to figure out this war
Time to figure out
Time to figure out
Figure out what I'm fighting for

Into the unknown
Let's follow this through
I'm fighting for us
But most of all, for you
Our heart's like a flood
That washes us new
I'm fighting for us
But most of all, for you

Most of all, for you
Most of all, for you
Most of all, for you
Most of all, for you

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
