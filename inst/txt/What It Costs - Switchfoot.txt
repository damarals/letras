"1" "What It Costs
Switchfoot

Sun light fading fast, make it last
Like a flame flickers, then it's past
Moonlight fades to dark, carry on
You never know what's real until it's gone

But love deals the currency of loss
Don't ever forget what it costs

Hold on to me, carry me through
Our story needs the pain that we outgrew
Yeah you can't call it love until you've lost
If you love someone this is what it costs

This city cries softly tonight
Like a million teardrops from a thousand eyes
I'm drenched beneath the rainy Melbourne skies
Wonder how it is I feel so dry inside

But love uses the pain to drill the holes
That irrigate our dry and thirsty souls

Hold on to me, carry me through
Our story, is the pain that we outgrew
Yeah you can't call it love until you've loss
If you love someone this is what it costs
Sun light fading fast make it last
Sun light fading fast make it last"
