"1" "Mighty Rebel
Switchfoot

The mighty rebel comes (teach ya love)
Not thinking about his own survival
The might rebel comes, (teach ya love)
And he don’t fear a rival
A deaf mind and a gentle heart
Living in a world falling apart

The mighty rebel, the mighty, mighty rebel comes

You know you got to rise up, rise up
The war has begun
To fight like he’s the only solution
And love is a gun

The mighty rebel, the mighty, mighty rebel comes

The mighty rebel comes (ready to live)
In the face of the impossible
The mighty rebel comes (willing to die)
To obey the unenforceable law
Haters can’t keep the rebel down
The other cheek is the rebel’s crown

The mighty rebel, the mighty, mighty rebel comes

You know you got to rise up, rise up
The war has begun
To fight like he’s the only solution
And love is a gun"
