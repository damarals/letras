Hillsong United

Signs and wonders from above
When you pour out your Spirit
On the old and the young
In the power of Your presence

Holy Spirit rain
Falling like a flood
Break upon my praise
As I sing of your love

Holy Spirit fire
Burn within my soul
As I call on your name
As I call on your name

Dreams and visions of the son
As I stand in your presence
Revelations of your love
As I look to the heaven

Holy Spirit rain
Falling like a flood
Break upon my praise
As I sing of your love

Holy Spirit fire
Burn within my soul
As I call on your name
As I call on your name
As I call on your name
As I call on your name
Jesus

Oh Holy Spirit
Burn like a fire
All consuming
Consume me

Here in your presence
Lord I surrender
To your glory
For your glory

Oh holy spirit
Burn like a fire
All consuming
Consume me

Here in your presence
Lord I surrender
To your glory
For your glory

Living water
River wild in me
Immerse me in your mercy
Open heaven
Crushing over me
Restore me in your glory

Oh holy spirit
Burn like a fire
All consuming
Consume me

Here in your presence
Lord I surrender
To your glory
For your glory

For your glory

Oh Jesus

For your glory"
