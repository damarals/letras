"1" "Remade
Kari Jobe

Loving, breathing
Your love’s captivating
Here in Your hands
You have remade me

PRE CHORUS
All of my heart
I give You now
Laying aside
My fears and doubt
You are the life
From which I draw my breath

CHORUS
Breaking my heart
You beckon me
Desperate for You
I’ll ever be
You are the hope

From which
I gain my strength
I have been remade

Softly, gently
Holding me closely
You are the comfort
That I seek"
