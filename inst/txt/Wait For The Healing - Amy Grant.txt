"1" "Wait For The Healing
Amy Grant

One Had vision
One came bringing its doom
One saw napalm
One heard the man in the moon
We were children of promise
We were heirs to their dreams

Tell me, why then is the hand slow
And the dog bites, well, I don't know
But the sky will fall
And heads will roll
And it's all that we can do
To wait for the healing

Hungry hearted reason coming of age
Running headlong into the the latest rage
Always reaching within us
Claiming the answers are there

Tell me, why then is the hand slow
And the dog bites, well, I don't know
But the sky will fall
And heads will roll
And it's all that we can do
To wait for the healing
For to carry on
For to stand when all is said and done
In the shadow of the rising sun
Longing, waiting for the healing

We are children of promise
We are heirs to their dreams

Tell me, why then is the hand slow
And the dog bites, well, I don't know
But the sky will fall
And heads will roll
And it's all that we can do
To wait for the healing
For to carry on
For to stand when all is said and done
In the shadow of the rising sun
Longing, waiting for the healing
