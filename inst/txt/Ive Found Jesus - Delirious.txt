"1" "I've Found Jesus
Delirious

Well I hear they're singing in the street that
Jesus is alive
And all creation shouts aloud that
Jesus is alive
Now surely we can all be changed 'cos
Jesus is alive
And everybody here can know that
Jesus is alive

And I will live for all my days
To raise a banner of truth and light
To sing about my saviour's lve
And the best thing that happend
It was the day I met you

I've found Jesus x4

Well I feel like dancing in the street 'cos
Jesus is alive
To join with all who celebrate that
Jesus is alive
Well the joy of God is in this town 'cos
Jesus is alive
For everybody's seen the truth that
Jesus is alive

And I will live for all my days
To raise a banner of truth and light
To sing about my saviour's love
And the best thing that happend
It was the day I met you

I've found Jesus x4

Well you lifted my from where I was
Set my feet upon a rock
Humbled that you even knew about me
Now i have chosen to believe
Believing that you've chosen me
I was lost but now i've found...."
