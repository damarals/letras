"1" "Darkest Part
Red

You track the doubts of my soul
Until you found it
The darkened room locked away
I let you in

You looked inside then you turned away
My makeshift savior
He left me right here in my chains
But still I whisper
Still I call you

I never wanted you to see
The darkest part of me
I knew you? d run away
I waited but you never came

So afraid to be alone
I tried to let you go
And still I find you lost inside
The darkest part of me

It? s my decent
To know your pain
It? s watching all
I believed fade away

Half traitors and fools
Half beggars and thieves
Which mask will you choose
What is underneath

I never wanted you to see
The darkest part of me
I knew you? d run away
I waited but you never came

So afraid to be alone
I tried to let you go
And still I find you lost inside
The darkest part of me

And out of the black state of your perfect life
And out of the darkness that you need to hide
It covers you
It spills over you

I never wanted you to see
The darkest part of me
I knew you? d run away
I waited but you never came

So afraid to be alone
I tried to let you go
And still I find you lost inside
The darkest part of me"
