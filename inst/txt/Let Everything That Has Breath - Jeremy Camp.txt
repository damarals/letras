"1" "Let Everything That Has Breath
Jeremy Camp

Praise You in the morning
Praise You in the evening
Praise You when I'm young
and when I'm old

Praise You when I'm laughing
Praise You when I'm grieving
Praise You every
season of the soul

If we could see
how much You're worth
Your power,
Your might,
Your endless love
Then surely we would
never cease to praise you

Everything that,
everything that
Everything that
has breath praise the Lord

Everything that,
everything that
Everything that
has breath praise the Lord

Praise You in the heavens
Join with the angels
Praising You forever and a day

Praise You on the earth now
Join with creation
Calling all the nations to Your praise

If we could see
how much You're worth
Your power,
Your might,
Your endless love
Then surely we would
never cease to praise you

Everything that,
everything that
Everything that
has breath praise the Lord"
