Ó Light Eternal, who come to this earth
Enlighten my min and strengthen my will
That I may not give up in times of great affliction

I trust in You
Ó uncreated Light!

Ó Infant Jesus, You are a model
for me in doing Your Father's will
Grant that I also may do God's will
faithfully ain all things
Ó Divini Infant, Grant me this grace!

I trust in You
Ó uncreated Light!"
