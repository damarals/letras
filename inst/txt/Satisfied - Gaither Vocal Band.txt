Gaither Vocal Band

Well satisfied with Jesus, satisfied with Jesus
Said He would be my comfort
Said He would be my guide
Well, well I looked at my hands, my hands looked new
I looked at my feet and they did too
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied
Well, satisfied with Jesus, satisfied with Jesus
Because said He would be my comfort
Said He would be my guide
Well, well I looked at my hands, my hands looked new
I looked at my feet and they did too
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied
The Lord moves in mysterious ways
His wonders to perform
He plants His feet on every step
And then He rides on every storm
Well He fixed my feet for runnin', boys
Then my eyes were opened up wide
He fixed my tongue so I could say
\"Praise God, I'm satisfied.\"
Well satisfied with Jesus, so satisfied with Jesus
Said He would be my comfort
Said He would be my guide
Well, well I looked at my hands, my hands looked new
I looked at my feet and they did too
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied
Well it was way down yonder in the valley, boys
I was wandering' all alone
And it was there I met my Jesus,
You know He claimed me for His own
And then He put His arms all around me there
And then He drew me up to His side
Satisfied with Jesus, satisfied with Jesus
Said He would be my comfort
Said He would be my guide
Well, I looked at my hands, my hands looked new
I looked at my feet and they did too
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied
