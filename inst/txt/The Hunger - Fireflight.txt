"1" "The Hunger
Fireflight

Cut it out, cut it out
I know it's what
You're wanting to say

Burning up, burning up
I know why
You're feeling this way

There's an ache
You can't erase
A yearning
That you can't replace

And you want Him
And you need Him
But you act
Like He's not there
Yeah, you know
That you're hollow
And something's
Missing here
So you push
And you pull
The hole in your soul
But you can't make
The hunger disappear

You got a rusted out
Lock on your door
Getting ready to break
You've held back
Love long enough
I think it's time to cave

You're waiting for a sign
The fact is faith is blind

Do you want to spend
Your whole life jaded?
Stuck in a rut
That you created
Why don't you
Break the cycle?
Let love win"
