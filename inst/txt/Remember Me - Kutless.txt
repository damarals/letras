Kutless

I looked in Your eyes
And saw it for a moment
The passion in Your cry
The chains of life are broken

Put to death by Your people
You came to bring us life
Only hope for the hopeless
Will You remember me?

I've ben ashamed
I've been put down
Head in my hands
My life on the ground

Left heaven to save
Liars and thieves
Sinners like me
Your blood sets us free

Who am I
That You would remember me?

Spent all of my years
Stealing from the world
With everything i had
I was still so poor

You have everything to lose
But You're dying here with me
I believe
Will You remember me?

I've been ashamed
I've been put down
Head in my hands
My life on the ground

Left heaven to save
Liars and thieves
Sinners like me
Your blood sets us free

Who am I?

Take what I have left my Savior
Take me with You from this cross
When I leave this life completely
Remember me

I've been ashamed
I've been put down
Head in my hands
My life on the ground

Left heaven to save
Liars and thieves
Sinners like me
Your blood sets us free

I've been ashamed
I've been put down
Head in my hands
My life on the ground

Left heaven to save
Liars and thieves
Sinners like me
Your blood sets us free

Who am I
That You would remember me?
