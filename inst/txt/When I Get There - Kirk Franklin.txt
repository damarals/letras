[Kirk]
Now this song is about heaven alright.
This song is about heaven alright.
Houston, I said this song is about heaven
I said this song is about heaven.
If it's about heaven, I want you to clap with me
Clap, clap, c'mon, c'mon
Houston, Houston c'mon uh
C'mon Houston uh
Hang in there, don't ya'll go no where
Don't you go nowhere, c'mon, c'mon

[Verse 1]
The sun will shine and
My heart shall sing and
One thought of you Jesus
(what what, what what)
What joy it brings
My soul can't wait to
To see your face
I'll bless your name Jesus
When I get there

[Verse 2]
You'll wipe tears
You'll say well done and
You'll hold me close and
Tell me I'm over come and
You will exchange
Joy for my pain
And I'll praise your name Jesus
When I get there

[Chorus]
C'mon
Let's go (Let's go)
We'll cry (We'll Cry)
No I won't (No I won't)
We're gonna be just like Jesus
When we get there

C'mon
Hold On (Hold On)
It won't (It won't)
Be long (Be long)
We're gonna be just like Jesus
When we get there

[Verse 1]

[Verse 2]

[Chorus 2x's]

[Hook]
No more feeling alone ([alto:] no more feeling alone)
([tenor:] I'm never alone)
And all my fears will be gone ([alto:] and all my fears
will be gone) ([tenor:] I'm never alone)
You tell me it won't be long ([alto:] you tell me it
won't be long) ([tenor:] It won't be long)
When you call my name
We shall be changed

[Kirk]
Clap your hands uh
