"1" "He's Watching Me
Gaither Vocal Band

He has Jupiter for a pillow,
an angel choir for a lullaby,
clouds for a blanket,
and the moon is his night light.
But he don't ever sleep,
'cause he's busy watching over me.
He rules the universe, from his throne on high.
But when I need attention, he is by my side,
He's watching me. Yes, he's watching me.

He's a busy God but on his list of things to do,
His number one priority is watching me and you.
He's taking care of business,
Feeding birds and making rain.
But he'll stop what he's doing
When I speak his name.
Cause he's watching, he's watching me.

He might be busy painting rainbows,
or making demons plead.
But he'll still find the time
To make some time for you and me.
There's nothing, no no nothing,
He would rather do.
Well he knows when I'm in trouble,
He don't miss a beat.
Oen eye's on that sparrow
And the other one's on me,
He's watching me.
Yes, he's watching me.

He's a busy God but on his list of things to do,
his number one priority is watching me and you.
He's taking care of business,
Feeding birds and making rain.
But he'll stop what he's doing
When I speak his name.
He's a busy God but on his list of things to do,
his number one priority is watching me and you.
He's taking care of business,
Feeding birds and making rain.
But he'll stop what he's doing
When I speak his name.
Cause he's watching, he's watching me.
Yes he's watching, he's watching me.
Well, he's watching, he's watching me"
