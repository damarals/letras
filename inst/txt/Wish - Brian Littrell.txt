For just a moment I wish I could have been there
to see your first step, hear your very first word
Tell me did you ever fall and scrape your knee?
Did you know your wounds would one day heal the world?
For just one moment I wish I could have seen you growing
Learnin' the ways of a carpenter's son
Just a little boy gazing at the stars
But you remember creating everyone
If you passed by would I have seen a child or a king?
Would I have known?

I wish I could have been there
My only wish is to see you face to face
Wish I could have been there
Just to see you Jesus face to face

For just a moment I wish I could have been there when you
You left your footprints upon the waves
To walk along beside you and never look away
Just your whisper and the wind and sea obey
To see you feed the people
To feel your healing in your touch

I wish I could have been there
My only wish is to see you face to face
Wish I could have been there
Just to see you Jesus face to face

To hear you pray in the garden alone
laying down your will with each tear
To see you walk that lonely road
Willing to die for me
And in that moment I know I should have been there
you took my cross and gave your life (and you live again)
Oh, and you live again

I wish I could have been there
My only wish is to see you rise again
Wish I could have been there
My only wish to see you Jesus face to face

Someday I'll be there, I'm gonna be there
I'll see your face, your mercy, your grace
Someday, Someday
I'm gonna see you Jesus face to face"
