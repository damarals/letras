Album: Hero
Song: Afterwhile

Afterwhile, this too shall pass, Afterwhile
Scars will heal, you’ll love again
It won’t hurt you, Afterwhile
Stuck between if and when
You prayed, you tried, but still no end

God’s purpose soon you’ll understand
It won’t hurt you, than Afterwhile [2x]

Afterwhile, this too shall pass, Afterwhile
Scars will heal, you’ll love again
It won’t hurt you, Afterwhile
Stuck between if and when
You prayed, you tried, but still no end

So when the pain has come to end
And now your heart is whole again
Help someone who needs to know
That it won’t hurt, Afterwhile

It won’t hurt you, Afterwhile [2x]"
