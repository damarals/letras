"1" "God Blesses Me Everyday
MÃºsicas Gospel

If God hadn't smiled on me,
I could be living pitifully.
I might be committing crime,
Or locked up and doing time.

I might be a beggar on the street,
Shoved away by those I meet.
Mine could be a dreamless life,
I could be a lot I wouldn't like.

Chorus:
God blesses me everyday,
By the love he sends to me.
He's put friends in my life,
And I have a loving family.

I had parents who gave me love,
When I was delivered from above.
Many people have loved me,
I count blessings I can see.

I have friends that really care,
In my heart is love to share.
My life has been a good one,
I'm not ashamed of what I done.

Chorus:
God blesses me everyday,
By the love he sends to me.
He's put friends in my life,
And I have a loving family."
