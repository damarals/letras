Vineyard

I can breathe sweet spring flowers
I can see deep blue skies
Lord I feel refreshing breezes
Like Your thoughts inside my mind

I like to run through the green grass
Watch the waves crash the shore
Gaze as mountains go higher
Creation can't be ignored

When I see all the beauty of Your creation
Lord it makes my spirit free to worship You
When I see all the beauty of Your creation
Lord it drives me to my knees to worship You"
