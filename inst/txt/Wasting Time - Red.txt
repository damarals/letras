"1" "Wasting Time
Red

You found me here
Waiting for your chance
You would reach inside
And take of me
You want your lies
To smother me again
But now you can't

Don't even try
You're wasting time
Come back I'll beat you down
Turn around
I'm fighting my way through you
Push you away
I'll never break
Come back I'll beat you down
It's over now
Iâ€™m turning my back on you

I turn around
There you are
A blink and a flash
Back to you again
You pushed me down
Tried to steal it all
This time I'm pushing back

Go ahead, try and stop me
Go ahead, try and stop me
Go ahead, try and stop me
Go ahead and try"
