Vineyard

Take our hands
Move our feet
Break our hearts
With the things that make Your heart break
(2nd time)
With the things that make Your heart break

Let us be Your hands
Let us be Your feet
Let us be the love
That longs for those in need [Repeat]

Spirit move
Across the land
We invite You
To move on earth by Your sovereign hand
(2nd time)
Come and move on earth by Your sovereign hand

We will be Your hands
We will be Your feet
We will be the love
That longs for those in need"
