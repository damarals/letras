"1" "Kaliforn-eye-a
P.O.D.

I go where I wanna go
I keep the thang on the downlow
I'm from the south side of Diego till the day that I
die;
Better put it on my tombstone.
I keep my head to the sky
I'm still living for the sunshine
I got love for the streets and the rest of my homies
still doing their time
I mon a burn ina fire ago blaze
Cali livin for the rest of my days
To overstand I will stay in já ways to keep from
going insane

It's all good. it's alright
You wanna ride it ain't no thang that's just how we
play
It's all day and all night.
We're coming up in the streets of Kaliforn-Eye-A

You know I've heard it all before
And i don't care about who you know.
You see I've been around the world,
Had a lot of good times but ain't nothing like the west
coast
I'm staying on my grind
I'm lowriding on the westside
I'm laid back in the cut. everybody know wussup so i'm
feeling alright
I mon a burn ina fire ago blaze
Cali livin for the rest of my days
To overstand i will stay in já ways to keep from
going insane.
