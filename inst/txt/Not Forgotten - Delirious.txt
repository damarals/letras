"1" "Not Forgotten
Delirious

Love is bigger than oceans
Love is given to me
Grace is bigger than history
Grace is given for free
And we'll keep the flame, ablaze

He, will not, be forgotten, be forgotten
He, will not, be forgotten, be forgotten

Faith is bigger than glory
Faith is stronger than pain
Hope is bigger than rainbows
Hope is all that we've got
And we'll keep the flame, ablaze

You, will not, be forgotten, be forgotten
You, will not, be forgotten, be forgotten"
