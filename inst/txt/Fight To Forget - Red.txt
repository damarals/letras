"1" "Fight To Forget
Red

You're a monster in my mind
You're the one I can't leave behind
You crawled inside, I watched you die
Did you think that you could bury me

Your love is a lie
I will fight to forget
Your love is a knife
I will die to forget

Did you get what you want from me
You weren't the one that I thought you'd be
Everything it cost, everything I lost
Did you think that you could erase me

Your love is a lie
I will fight to forget
Your love is a knife
I will die to forget
I will fight to forget you
I will die to forget you
Let me go, let me go

You're abandoned
You're broken down
Your sickness, blame it on me
Your hopelessness
Your insanity
You're screaming, blame it on me

Your love is a lie
I will fight to forget
Your love is a knife
I would die to forget
I will fight to forget you
I will die to forget you"
