Testemunhas de Jeov√°

Heavenly father, please hear my song
You are my God; to you I belong
Great is your name, beyond all compare
Gracious jehovah, please hear my prayer

Thank you, dear God, for granting this day
Giving me life, and showing the way
How I delight in your tender care
Gracious jehovah, please hear my prayer

O how I long to do what is right!
Help me, o lord, to walk in the light
Give me the strength all burdens to bear
Gracious jehovah, please hear my prayer"
