"1" "The Best Stuff In The World Today Café
Take 6

Time for lunch, my stomach said
I left the office to get fed
But I had dined at every place on Min
My appetite was ripe for change
And there stood this old restaurant I had never seen before
And a stranger in an apron
Came bursting through the door and said:

Chorus:
Welcome to the best stuff, In the world today café
We all all believers, In a better way
We were served as customers, Here not so long ago
But now we all are waiters
We thought you ought to know

Then the waiter said to me
\"Everything we serve is free\"
And when he saw that I was full of doubt
He shoved the best stuff in my mouth
And the food was so fantastic
I could not stay in my seat
I jumped up from the table
Dragged a stranger off the street and said:

Chorus

And if you're inclined to take the time to show your gratitude
Then serve somebody else today just like I've done for you
Pretty soon the business went berserk
And all the people left their work
In every case because they took the time to serve
They each got more than they deserved
And the pantry soon was empty and all that they could find
Was some simple bread and wine
But the people stood in line to say:

Chorus

So no you know the way I learned
That once tables have been turned
It's just not enough to have your fill
Tip the waitress, pay the bill
When you could serve the banquet
That the world's so hungry for
So grab a waiter's apron
See who's at the door and say

Chorus"
