Youthful Praise

Verse:
For Your blood, thank You,
for how it washes sins,
how it kept pain away,
how it kept pestilence away.

For the Lord was wounded for our transgressions
and He was bruised for our iniquities.

Bridge:
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Vamp 1:
Oh The blood,
thank You for Your blood,
it’s precious, it’s saving it’s healing;
my heart will give the praise and say...

Vamp 2:
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
