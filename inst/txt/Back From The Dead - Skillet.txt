Cold,black,let's tie this coffin
Cause you all try to keep me down
How it feels to be forgotten
But you'll never forget me now
Enemies, Clawing at my eyes that
Scratch and bleed , Just to stay alive, yeah
The zombies come at night
They'll never catch me
They'll never catch me

B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back

Light it up, Light it up, Now I'm burnin
Feel the rush , Feel the rush of adrenaline
We are Young
We are Strong
We will rise
Cause I'm back, back
back from the dead tonight
To the floor, To the floor, Hit the red line
Fly it high , fly it high at the speed of light
For the love , For the light , For the fight
Cause I'm back, back
back from the dead tonight

Break the skin, Spread like poison
Die slowly when we all attack
How it feels to be the broken
You took a pice now I'm biting back
Enemies, Clawing at my eyes that
Scratch and bleed , Just to saty alive, yeah
The zombies come at night
They'll never catch me
They'll never catch me

We will rise
Cause I'm back, back
back from the dead tonight
To the floor, To the floor, Hit the red line
Fly it high , Fly it high at the speed of light
For the love , For the light , For the fight
Cause I'm back, back
back from the dead tonight

Deep down, For the count
Don't you dare cont me out
Never break, Never bow
Never beg, Not a doubt
The zombies come at night
They'll never catch me
They'll never catch me
