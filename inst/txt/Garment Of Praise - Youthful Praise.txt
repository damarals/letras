"1" "Garment Of Praise
Youthful Praise

God has given me a garment of praise
For the spirit of heaviness, gave me a praise
To render when I'm discouraged
It helps to keep problems from destroying me
It helps to keep my mind and spirit at peace
It's a gament of praise
Oh a garment of praise
(repeat)

Even when I'm feeling discouraged
I still say Hallelujah
Even when I'm sick in my body
I'll still give all the glory to Ya
Even when things don't go my way
I'll still give You the praise, continually,
I'll belss Your name
For my victory is in my praise
(repeat)

You might see me and wonder
Why I haven't lost my mind
When I've been through all I say
I've been through in such a short while
Don't be surprised
It's just that I've got a garment of prasie
(repeat)

I've got a garment of praise
Garment of praise
(repeat)

Don't be surprised
It's just that I've got a garment of praise"
