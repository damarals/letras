"1" "I've Got Life
Take 6

You know that I've got it (sho' you right) (I've got it) (yes I do)
I've got it (sho' you right) (sho' 'nuf got it) (I sure do)
You know that I've got it (sho' you right) (sho' you right)

Well you might wonder why I'm so happy
And if I'm right there's one thing you should know
I've just been connected (oh Lord) to an everlasting souce of power
And that power makes me glow
No I'm not saying I don't have problems
And I can't say that I don't get down
But it behooves me to move with a pep in my step
When I'm excited 'bout the joy that I've found

Channel:
I might have trouble on every side yet not distressed
I might be perplexed but never in despair
Persecuted but not forsaken
Cast down but not destroyed

Chorus:
Whoa I've got life in Jesus (Better believe)
That I've got life just look at the smile on my face
Oh I've got life in Jesus
And you know that I'm goona win this race
Got that life got that life

Well I'm glad! That's right, Glad!
Because now I know that I can win
This (here) race isn't given (no no)
To the swift or the strong
But the one who endures to the end (Bet I can win)
No, I'm not saying that I don't have burdens
And I can't say I'll never fall
But with my hand in his hand
I'm headed for a better land
And I know that it'll be worth it all

Chorus

(Y'all can sing it again)

You know that I've got it (sho' you right) (I've got it) (yes I do)
I've got it (sho' you right) (sho' 'nuf got it) (I sure do)
You know that I've got it (sho' you right) (sho' you right)
I'm a'livin-a'livin-a'livin-a'livin again
Got that life, Got that life, Got that life, Got that life, Got that life,
I'm a'livin-a'livin-a'livin-a'livin again

Chorus"
