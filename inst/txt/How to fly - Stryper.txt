How To Fly

I've always looked at you
As a beautiful creation
I hope you know it's true
You're my dearest proclamation

I see your perfection
And I say well done forever
My love and affection
Is for you in my endeavor

(Chorus)
But What Can I Do to
Make you love me?
Give you the world with
The stars and sky
What can I say
To make all the pain go away
And Show You How To Fly

All that I've ever wanted
Is for you to live in happiness
With overflowing joy
In a constant state of simple bliss

You are the world to me
I would never jeopardize a thing
One day I know you'll see
That I'm offering you everything

(Chorus)
But What Can I Do
To make you love me?
Give you the world with
The stars and sky
What can I say
To make all the pain go away
And Show You How To Fly

The sun shines down
It warms the heavens
To the ground
But doubt spins round & round

You can't stop love
It flows forever from above
And frees you when you're bound"
