"1" "Deep Of Your Grace
Hillsong United

You are the Shepherd
Giving what I could not afford
Leaving the many
You sought to find me Lord

I will remember
You are the reason for my song
Blessed Redeemer
You love me as Your own

In the deep of Your grace
All my sins are washed away
Here I know the power of forgiveness
Here I know the power of Your blood

All I am
will I lay down
All I have
before Your cross Lord"
