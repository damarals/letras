"1" "Let Us Adore
Hillsong United

The heavens declare, the glory of God and all of the world,
will join the praise, his wonders proclaim the oceans and skies,
lift up their voice and all he has made will rise to bless, the King of all Kings.
Let us adore Him, Let us adore him.
Jesus Christ, is the Lord. Eternitys song, is coming again.
Thorugh all of the earth, will fade away,
His truth will remain, Let us adore Him, Let us adore Him. Jesus Christ, is the Lord.
Come and behold Him, Bow Down before Him.
Jesus Christ is the Lord. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Your are worthy alone of all praise."
