"1" "Best Is Yet To Come
Red

Afraid it won't come around again
Afaid to move on
Wishing I could go back when
Everything was easier and meaningful to me

Wanting all we left behind
Like it's the answer
An hour glass we can't rewind
Holding back the life that I've denied for so long
Can I find my way to you?

And after all that we've been through
And after all we left in pieces
I still believe our live have just begun
Cause now the past can be our own
And I know you are the reason
I still believe the best is yet to come

A photograph still in your hand
Afraid to let go
The minutes rain like grains of sand
And time is just a war to steal your dreams from within
So come and take them back again

And after all that we've been through
And after all we left in pieces
I still believe our live have just begun
Cause now the past can be our own
And I know you are the reason
I still believe the best is yet to come

Won't turn around
Let it all slip away
I'm never backing down
Cause tomorrow's a new day
And everything can change

And after all that we've been through
And after all we left in pieces
I still believe our live have just begun
Cause now the past can be our own
And I know you are the reason
I still believe the best is yet to come

Oh, oh, yeah
Still believe the best is yet to come
The best yet to come
Still believe the best is yet to come"
