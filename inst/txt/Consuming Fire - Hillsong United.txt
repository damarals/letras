Hillsong United

There must be more than this
O breath of God come brethe within'
There must be more than this
Spirit of God we wait for You

Fill us anew with pray
Fill us anew with pray

Consuming fire fan into flame
A passion for your name
Spirit of God could you fall in this place
Lord have your way
Lord have your way with us

Come like a rushing wind
Clothe us with power from on high
Now set the captives free
Leave us abandoned to your praise

Lord let your glory fall
Lord let your glory fall

Stir it up in our hearts Lord
A passion for your name"
