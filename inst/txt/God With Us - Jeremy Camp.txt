"1" "God With Us
Jeremy Camp

Hallelujah the King has come
Beautiful Saviour God's own Son
Hallelujah the Christ is here
So rejoice for our salvation's near

Emmanuel, our humble King
We give you our hearts as an offering
You laid down your crown
And became as dust
Emmanuel, God with us

Hallelujah the angels sang
To certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay
Hallelujah the world will see
The fullness of His majesty

Emmanuel, our humble King
We give you our hearts as an offering
You laid down your crown
And became as dust
Emmanuel, God with us

Oh come all ye faithful our God is here
Joyful triumphant salvation's near
Oh come and behold our King
Come and behold Him

Emmanuel, our humble King
We give you our hearts as an offering
You laid down your crown
And became as dust
Emmanuel, Emmanuel
God with us"
