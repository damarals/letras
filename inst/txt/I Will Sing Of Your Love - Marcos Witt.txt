"1" "I Will Sing Of Your Love
Marcos Witt

For years I searched endlessly
For something worth living for
And in the midst of my seeking
Your love surrounded me

Your light has shown me the way
My fears have vanished away
Your love now governs and leads me
As I live for you alone

I will sing of your love
And surrender all my heart and my soul
You alone I desire
As I choose to walk and follow Your lead
YouÂ´re my God and my king
I will always sing of Your love"
