Some say: Don't give up
And hope your good, is good enough
Head down, keep on working
If you could earn it, then you deserve it
Some say: Push on through
After all, it's the least that you can do
But don't buy, what they're selling
It couldn't be further from the truth

What if I were the One to tell you
That the fight's already been won
Well, I think your day's about to get better
What if I were the One to tell you
That the work's already been done
It's now good news
It's the best news ever

Some say: Don't ask for help
God help the ones who help themselves
Press on, get it right
Otherwise, get left behind
Some say, [?]
So try hard, then try and lean on God
Hold up, if this weren't true
Explain to me, what the cross is for

What if I were the One to tell you
That the fight's already been won
Well, I think your day's about to get better
What if I were the One to tell you
That the work's already been done
It's now good news
It's the best news ever
Best news ever

So won't you, come!
Come all you weary and your burdens
You're heavy laden and you're hurting
For all of you with nothing left
Come and find rest!

What if I were the One to tell you
That the fight's already been won
Well, I think your day's about to get better
What if I were the One to tell you
That the work's already been done
It's now good news
It's the best news ever!
Best news ever

It's now good news
It's the best news ever
Best news ever
It's now good news
It's the best news ever!"
