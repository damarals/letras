"1" "Rebel Movement
Dominic Balli

Chorus: This the rebel movement
Feel the revolution now
Only one solution
Move the rebel movement out

Situation is desolation
It’s mind pollution
What’s explanation?
Society’s new philosophy is conformity
But they won’t conform me, oh no

Chorus:

Presidential election
Or governmental oppression
We think it’s root of the problem
Not the root of the problem
It’s depravity in humanity
But all of we is humanity, oh no

Chorus:

Take a stand don’t let the system win
United lift one voice and sing
Sing for the moment moment, we never bow down
Flee for the mountains never, we never back down
Sing for the moment moment, we never bow down
Flee for the mountains never, we pressin onward bound
So shall we sing for the moment moment, we never bow down
Flee for the mountains never, we never back down
Sing for the moment moment, we never bow down
Flee for the mountains never, we pressin onward bound"
