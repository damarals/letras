"1" "Unending Love
Hillsong United

There's no silver or gold
And no treasure untold
That could draw me away from Your heart
Neither love of myself
Or of anyone else will do

Jesus nothing compares
To this grace that rescued me
Saviour now and forever
Your face is all I seek

Now all I am
I lay at Your feet
I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty
One thing I know
I find all I need
In your unending love
In your unending love

Letting go all my pride
I lay down my desires
Just to worship
In spirit and in truth
More than all of my dreams
More than fame
I will seek You Lord

Jesus nothing compares
To this grace that rescued me
Saviour now and forever
Your face is all I seek

Now all I am
I lay at Your feet
I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty
One thing I know
I find what I need
In your unending love
In your unending love"
