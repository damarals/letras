"1" "Look For Me In Heaven
Marina de Oliveira

Look for me in heaven, Im gonna be around
Look for me in heaven, in heaven is where I will be found
Look for me in heaven, cause Im gonna look for you
We gonna celebrate and party
So I hope I get to see you too

In heaven there will be no good byes
We aint gonna miss no one
In heaven there will be no crying
Well never gonna be alone
We gatherround the throne of God
Hallelujah we will sing
Ginvinpraises to the Holy Lamb
Our saviour, our Lord and King

If some day I just desapear
Look for me in heaven

When its all passed in here I Shall be living with my King
In golden streets Ill step my feet
And I tell you thats not a dream
Well, there will be no day nor night
The Lamb will shine the brightest light
And the angels might just say to me
Oh! How we love to get to see you here"
