"1" "He Made Me Whole
MÃºsicas Gospel

The world had pulled me down,
Until it left me with only shame.
But he came and he made me whole,
When I prayed and said his name.

When I called his name, he heard me,
He came to me and he brought me joy.
I had felt him touch my soul,
When he was near he let me know,
When I prayed he made me whole.

Oh since I've found my blessed Lord,
And he's forgiven and saved my soul.
Oh I say his praise wherever I may go,
I had felt his love he made me whole.

Oh he made me whole, he made me whole,
And it was him, that saved my soul,
When he was near he let me know."
