"1" "God Has Humbled Himself
Comunidade Cat√≥lica Shalom

In His majesty, He became a slave
By love, God has humbled Himself
In His majesty, took our humanity
To save us, He died on the Cross
Risen, He's alive, oh my Beloved
Such a perfect offering
Perfect love to forgive
Every single sin

Your Body broken for me
Feeds my soul and, when I'm down
Is truth and tenderness
Your Blood, Lord, shed for me
Lives up my mind and when I'm weak
Is in my heart my sweet heaven of Peace

Is truth and tenderness
Your Blood, Lord, shed for me
Lifts up my mind when I'm weak

Jesus, Jesus
Name above all names, Almighty Lord
