"x"
"1" "Party
Chris Tomlin

Gonna outshout the heavens now.
Gonna sing loud and drown the sea out.
Gonna celebrate the life I found. I found.
I'm found.


I was blind but now I see.I
was lost be He rescued me.
He saved the day and He set me free.
Set me free, now I'm free.


---Chorus---

We're gonna
Party
I can feel it down inside
Party
I was dead now I'm alive


Anybody feel like dancing?
Anybody feel like singing along?
Anybody feel like shouting?
Anybody feeling a party going on?"
