"1" "Anywhere With Jesus
Amy Grant

Chorus
Anywhere with jesus i can safely go
Anywhere he leads me in this world below
Answhere without him dearest joys would fade
Anywhere with jesus i am not afraid

Anywhere, anywhere ...any little fear i'll never
Know
Anywhere with jesus i can safely go
Anwhere with jesus, i am not alone
Other friends may fail me, he is still my own
Tho' his hand may lead me over drearest ways
Anwhere with jesus is a house of praise

Repeat chorus

Anwhere with jesusi can go to sleep
When the darkest shadows round about me
Creep
Knowing i shall waken nevermore to roam
Anywhere with jesus will be home, sweet home"
