"1" "Fill Me Up, Oh Lord
Nívea Soares

I’m coming after you
Where others fail to follow
I hear you calling me
Your sweet fragrance draws me

Into the place of your holy presence
The place of your embrace
The place where I am overwhelmed by your love

All creation anxiously waits for the manifestation of your glory im me
Here I am, oh Lord
Manifest yourself to me
Manifest yourself through me

Fill me up, oh Lord
Fill me up, oh Lord
I will answer your call to this generation
Fill me up, oh Lord
Fill me up, oh Lord
I want to be your answer to this generation"
