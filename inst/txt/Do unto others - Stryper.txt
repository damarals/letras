Do Unto Others

We all have questions
Many concerns
Simple frustrations
Respect is what we yearn

We are offended
Easily on cue
Often unfriended
Without a single clue

If we could step back
To see what matters
We would call off the attack
Break the hate
And watch it shatter

(Chorus)
Do Unto Others as you would
Have them do unto you
Often it's a thought misunderstood
But one we must pursue

This life is too short
To waste a day
And worry about
The games we often play

Look to the future
It's shining bright
It's really not hard
To choose what we know is right

It's simple choices
We make alone
If we would think of each other
Maybe we would heal
Not suffer

(Chorus)
Do Unto Others as you would
Have them do unto you
Often it's a thought misunderstood
But one we must pursue"
