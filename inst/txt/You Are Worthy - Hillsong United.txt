"1" "You Are Worthy
Hillsong United

Any crown I've ever won I lay it down
Any praise I've ever gained I give it all to you
For there's nothing in this world that can compare
For you alone are worthy, you alone are worthy.

You are near to all who call upon your name
Ever giving, ever loving you remain the same
For you open up your hand and satisfy
I give you all the glory, give you all the glory.

You are worthy, o Lord, of all honour
You are worthy to receive all praise
In your presence I live and with all I have to give
I will worship you
Honour you, glorify your holy name."
