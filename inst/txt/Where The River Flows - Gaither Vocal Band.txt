"1" "Where The River Flows
Gaither Vocal Band

Where the river flows
Where the river flows
Bring all your troubles
Take off your heavy shoes
Tired of the hustle
Let it wash away your blues

Where the river flows
Where the river flows
Wade in the water
Step off the dusty ground
If it gets hotter
You can cool your spirit down

Flow from heaven
Flow down over me

Where the river flows
Where the river flows
Where there is healing
For every wounded soul
Lost in the feeling
Let the mighty river roll

Flow from heaven
Flow down over me

Where the river flows
Where, where, where,
where [cascade] the river flows
Where, where, where,
where [cascade] the river flows
Where the river flows"
