"1" "I Will Lift My Hands
Vineyard

I will worship you, (I will worship you)
Worship and adore you
I will worship you, (I will worship you)
Lay my life before you

I'll bow my head before your glory
Worship at your feet
And I'll declare that you are worthy
I'll set my eyes on you alone and

I will lift my hands to you saying
\"Father I love you, Father I need you\"
I will lift my voice and sing
I will sing of your glory, the glory of my king"
