They tell us lies
They pull us in
They bury us alive
They hold us down
They live within
They're never satisfied
Lost in a world of dark delusion
I'm reaching for the light
We don't need this complication

Don't hesitate to explode
Burn the pain inside your soul
Don't hesitate, let it go
Start a fire, embrace the light
And ignite (start the fire)
And ignite (start the fire)
And ignite (start the fire)
And ignite

They pour the shame
Till we can't stand
The sight of our own face
They pin us down
Till we can't win
It's a game we can't escape
But we don't have to let them beat us
We can take control
In the flames we find our freedom

Don't hesitate to explode
Burn the pain inside your soul
Don't hesitate, let it go
Start a fire, embrace the light
And ignite (start the fire)
And ignite (start the fire)
And ignite (start the fire)
And ignite

Don't hesitate to explode
Burn the pain inside your soul
Don't hesitate, let it go
Start a fire, embrace the light

Don't hesitate to explode
Burn the pain inside your soul
Don't hesitate, let it go
Let it go
And ignite (start the fire)
And ignite (start the fire)
And ignite (start the fire)
And ignite"
