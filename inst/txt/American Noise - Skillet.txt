American Noise

Angry words and
Honking cars
Satellites and
Falling stars
Distant dark blue radios
That's whispered on my boulevard
Ghosts and chains rattle in the attic
Broken headphones filled with static
Lonely room, you've got nowhere to run

Three...two... One for all and all for one

Times will be bad
Times will be good
Things I wish I hadn't done and
Some how wish I would
Cutting through the american noise
You've got a voice
And a song to sing
Drink deep in the morning
See what the day will bring

La da da da
Lift up you're voice
Let love cut through
The american noise

Slamming doors and
Cell phone rings
Hurricane force of
Silent screams
Don't know what to believe
Bend the rule
Just to break it
You're so tired
Cause you've got to fake it
But you just wanna be someone

Three...two... One for all and all for one

Times will be bad
Times will be good
Things I wish I hadn't done and
Some how wish I would
Cutting through the american noise
You've got a voice
And a song to sing
Drink deep in the morning
See what the day will bring

La da da da
Lift up you're voice
Let love cut through
The american noise

No matter who you are
You've got a voice
Why don't you use it
Sing you're own song
Take all the noise
And make it into music"
