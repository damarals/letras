"1" "Bring Your Kingdom
Vineyard

I will wait in silence for You
Each and every day
I watch for You
I will look to the heavens
For You're my hope and my portion
I will wait in silence for You

Bring Your kingdom, heal and restore
Send Your Spirit and fill us once more
Maranatha, come oh Lord, bring Your kingdom

Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord"
