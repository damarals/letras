"1" "Isaiah (the Willing)
For Today

Here I am, God.
Send me to the world.
There is a burden on my heart to let the world know that You are God.
From You, the mighty King of Kings,
I learn the word that sustains the weary heart.
But, I have been silent for far too long.
I love them too much to sit back and watch them die.
So take the life that you gave to me, Lord,
and speak your heart to a generation.

Brothers and sisters, my prayer for you has been heard.
And you can take refuge and hope in this Word:
This is the end of the world as we know it.
Death will hold no power.
Dry your tears and lift your head.
Death will hold no power.

Let the light of life shine down upon a people in darkness.

We are the grateful forgiven; the restored and renewed.
We will take for ourselves no rest until we are face of God on the earth.
And take no rest, God.
Take no rest for yourself.
Take no rest, oh Lord.
May we be the generation to bring your glory down.

Our generation will prophesy.
So let the world know,
we are a dynasty."
