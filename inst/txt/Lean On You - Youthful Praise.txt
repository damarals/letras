"1" "Lean On You
Youthful Praise

Verse 1:
Lord, You know what each day will bring,
for You designed my destiny.
Each test and trial comes tailor made for me.
Lord, You know just how I feel,
people see my smile but it's not real.
I need Your strength to make it through,
can I lean on You?
Chorus:
Let me lean on You,
I'm too weak to stand on my own,
I'm prone to fall again.
All my tears are gone,
can't cry no more,
as I lay prostrate
in the middle of the floor.
Lord, I call Your name, I am not ashamed,
at the end of my rope, You're my only hope;
I have done all I can do, Jesus,
can I lean on You?
I have done all I can do, Jesus,
let me lean on You?
Verse 2:
Lord, it's cold, I can't get warm,
seems like I'm stuck inside this storm.
But I know You promised
You'd never leave me,
He won't leave you.
How can I stand without Your hand,
Lord, I'm holding on, but I feel so all alone;
sometime it's so hard to pray to You,
can I lean on You?
Chorus
Vamp 1:
Let me lean on You, Jesus.
I want to lean on Jesus.
Vamp 2:
Let me lean on You, Jesus.
I need to lean on Jesus.
Vamp 3:
I've got to lean on Jesus.
Let me lean on You, Jesus.
Vamp 4:
I've got to lean."
