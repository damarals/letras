"1" "The Savior Of All Men
MÃºsicas Gospel

It was the world's great-est loss,
They tied and nailed to a cross.
The de-vil smiled, as it was done
Be-cause God cried for his son.

None of them felt an-y shame,
And he felt no dis-grace
As they stripped him,
and spit in his face.

They nev-er knew in the end,
That he'd paid for their sins.
Or that he was
The sav-ior of all men.

He died for the world
On a cross, on a hill.
And, it was for our sins
That he was killed.

They nev-er knew in the end
That he'd paid for their sins.
Or that he was
The savior of all men."
