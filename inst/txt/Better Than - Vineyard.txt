"1" "Better Than
Vineyard

Your love is better than all things
Your love is better than all things
And I don't have the strength of words
To tell You truly how I feel

Your love is better than life
Your love is better than life
And I don't have the strength of words
To tell You truly how I feel

My God, You are the only one
For me, the only one for me
My God, Your love is better than
All other loves
And now You're drawing me
And I just want to be
Closer to You"
