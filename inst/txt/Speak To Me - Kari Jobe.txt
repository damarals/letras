"1" "Speak To Me
Kari Jobe

The sound of many waters
Calms the sea in me
The voice that ends the silence
Meets me in my need
Like fireworks igniting in my chest
The weight of Your glory
The reverence

I'm in awe that You would come to me
In awe that I could hear You speak

Speak to me, Speak to me
I'm listening
Speak to me, Speak to me
I'm listening

The sound that shakes the heavens
The whisper on the wind
Breaks my inhibitions
And settles me within
The mystery, You're closer than my skin
Your still, small voice moving me again

I hang on to every word You say
I live to hear You say my name

Speak to me, Speak to me
I'm listening
Speak to me, Speak to me
I'm listening

I'm in awe that You would come to me
In awe that I could hear You speak
I hang on to every word You say
I live to hear You say my name
I hang on to every word You say
I live to hear You say my name"
