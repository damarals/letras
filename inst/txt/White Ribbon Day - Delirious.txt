"1" "White Ribbon Day
Delirious

How can it be that God is love?
When blood rolls down upon our land
And fathers lose their only son
Where is the hope?
Oh God we pray for white ribbon day

How can it be that you could love?
When blood ran down that wooden cross
Your father gave his only son
You came for peace
You came to die for white ribbon day

And we pray for peace
To flood our hearts again
Only God can save our nation now
And we long for joy to fill our streets again
Only God can save our nation now

How can it be that God is just?
When flesh is torn from young and old
And children run in bloody fields
Where is the hope?
Oh God we pray for white ribbon day

And we pray for peace
To flood our hearts again
Only God can save our nation now
And we long for joy to fill our streets again
Only God can save our nation now

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah for white ribbon day

And can it be that You are just
When flesh was torn for young and old?
And here we stand saved by Your blood
We'll stand with courage
We'll live and die for white ribbon day

Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah for white ribbon day"
