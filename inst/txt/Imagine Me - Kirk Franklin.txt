"1" "Imagine Me
Kirk Franklin

Imagine me
loving what I see when the mirror looks at me cause I
I imagine me

In a place
of no insecurities and
I'm finally happy cause
I imagine me

Letting go of all of the ones who hurt me cause
they never did deserve me
can you imagine me?

Saying no to thoughts that try to control me
remembering all you told me, Lord
can you imagine me?

Over what my momma said and
hear from what my daddy did and
I wanna live and not read that page again

(Chorus)
Imagine me, being free, trusting you totally
finally I can imagine me
I admit it was hard to see
you being in love with someone like me
finally I can imagine me

Imagine me

Being strong
and not letting people break me down
(you won't get that joy this time around!)
Can you imagine me?

In a world (in a world)
nobody has to live afraid
(because of your love it's gone away)
can you imagine me?

Letting go of my past and
glad I have another chance and
not hard to dance
cause I don't have to read that page again.

(Repeat 2 times Chorus)

Kirk talks:
This song is dedicated to people like me
those that struggle with insecurities, acceptance
and even self esteem
you never felt good enough
you never felt pretty enough
but imagine God whispering in your ear
letting you know that everything that has happened
is now

Gone, Gone, Its' Gone, All Gone
Repeat 8
