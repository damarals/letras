"1" "Christmas Time Again
Hillsong United

So it’s Christmas time again…
I can’t believe it’s Christmas time again
It seems like only yesterday
The world was celebrating away
The town is painted over, shining bright
And everybody’s wearing smiles
‘Cause no one can deny the joy here
The little child born so long ago
Still bringing hope today in all the world
I know you can fell it
Children ‘round you beaming
And something inside you needing
The joy they’re feeling
‘Cause it’s Christmas time again
Don’t worry ‘bout the ones who say
That you’re way too old to have fun and laugh
Because it’s Christmas time again
Here comes the sound of Christmas time again
Carol singing near and far
Bringing cheer our of every heart
It doesn’t matter what your circumstance
Hope is on its way to you
There’s someone greater watching over
So it’s Christmas time again…"
