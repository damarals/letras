"1" "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts)
Amy Grant

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's bringing lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple wish
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many way
Merry Christmas to you

They know that Santa's on his way

And so I'm offering this simple wish

Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas to you
