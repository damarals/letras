"1" "The Feeling
Kutless

I feel like I can’t stand still any more
Are you with me
Got a mic, here's the band
Now get your feet off the floor
Can you hear me

I can not run away
This feelings got to stay
While we rock all night long
I think that we all know
The reason that we show
The world how real we are

Turn it up, feel the beat,
And scream the lyrics you know
Keep it coming
The time is right
Let’s unite to the rock and roll
Everybody

There’s a greater meaning
Behind the music that we’re bringing
‘Cause tonight we are singing
And together we know

We can not run away…"
