"1" "Glory Come Down
Jesus Culture

My heart is in Your hands
Keep me closer
In my life I make a stand
To follow You only

Every Word that You speak will stand forever
So speak now to me
I'm waiting here for You

Open the heavens
Let Your glory come down
My heart burns for You, Jesus
For Your presence, for Your holy fire

And consume me with Your fire
And all my desire burn for You, burn for You"
