"1" "Tonight (feat. John Cooper)
Toby Mac

Every time I try to go it alone
I get shut down
Locked up and held captive in the clutches of my doubt
We go back
We go forth
We go back
I’m sick with vertigo
Weary of my ways
My days
My ebbs and flows
So
I wanna feel a new day
(There’s gotta be more than this)
I wanna live a new way
(There’s gotta be more)
I wanna feel a new day
(There’s gotta be more than this)
I wanna live a new way
(There’s just gotta be more)
Right here, right now
Under the stars
I promise You my heart
‘Cause it starts tonight
We wanna rise
We wanna touch the other side
(It starts tonight)
We wanna soar
We wanna reach right out for more
(‘Cause it starts tonight)
Tonight
Can’t feel like any night before
Under a sky full of stars
With hearts that want more (Tonight)
Like a river no dam can hold
Being driven by a source overflowin’ our souls (Tonight)
Won’t be like any night we’ve seen
It changes everything
Everything
Under a sky full of stars
With hearts that want more (Tonight)
So let us seize this night
Let us make our play
It’s on like the break of dawn
Come what may, let us
Tonight
(‘Cause it starts tonight)
I wanna feel the new day
I wanna live a new way
(‘Cause it starts tonight)
We want more tonight
We want you tonight
Tonight
