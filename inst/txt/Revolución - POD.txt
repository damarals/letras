P.O.D.

Why everybody always talking
Bout the same o' thang?
How will I ever revise
If ain't nobody want to change?

You'd rather stay put
Close your eyes
And just keep your mouth shut!
But if you're like me
And you know whats up
You better speak up!
Now speak up!

Do you hear the sound of a revolution? Hey!
Will you stand and fight for a revolution? Hey
Could you live and die for a revolution? Hey
Then turn your back to the world
Throw your fist in the air and start a revolution!

See we don't care what people say
When the time comes they run away
But I'll be there
So show the world that we don't play
This revolution we declare!

They'll take it away if you don't stand your ground and
Show them that you won't back down
(That you won't back down)
What would you say
If I told the world has already taught you
(Taught you how to act now)

Make you feel bad
Like something's wrong with you
If you won't bow down!
(If you won't bow down)
The time has come for you
To take your place
And set ablaze this fire!
Come let me show you how!

I-ya man beware of the brimstone and fire
So be aware of the sly and shifty words of the liar
And make sure with whom you stand
One Man, true love alliance
Everything else a lie
But the conquering Lion of Mount Zion
Let's go!"
