"1" "Without You
For Today

Without you
I'm barely hanging on
Was there something more that I could have said?
They say tomorrow's sun will rise
But it won't shine here
Without you

I'm barely hanging on
Was there something more that I could have done?
They say tomorrow's sun will rise
But it won't shine here
Without you

Death came into my life
When the blood stood still in your face
In that moment of weakness
You changed my life forever
And I had no say
The sun has set on the time we had together
Pain took you away
Oh!
Pain took you away
Death came into my life
When the blood stood still in your face
Oh, since that day
I'm not so fearless anymore
I have to find a way
To be stronger than before
Left here
Without you

I'm barely hanging on
Was there something more that I could have said?
They say tomorrow's sun will rise
But it won't shine here
Without you

I'm barely hanging on
Was there something more that I could have done?
They say tomorrow's sun will rise
But it won't shine here
Without you

You took the easy way out
And you left me to pick up the pieces
I keep saying I don't hold it against you
But I'm not sure if I really believe it

I have to be stronger
I have to be stronger
I have to be stronger than surrender
I have to be stronger than surrender
I have to be stronger than surrender
Stronger, stronger than surrender
Stronger, stronger than surrender
I have to be stronger"
