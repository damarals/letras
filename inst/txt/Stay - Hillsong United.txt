Hillsong United

I am not the same
I’ve been called by name
You gave me new life
I cannot express how it feels
Here in Your arms

Here I’ll stay forever
I have found Your love
Here I’ll stay forever
Hold me in Your arms

Jesus take my hand
Lead me on Your path
I give You my life
I cannot express how it feels
Here in Your arms

Here I’ll stay forever
Here I’ll stay with You"
