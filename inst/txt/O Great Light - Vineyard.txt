"1" "O Great Light
Vineyard

You've undone the grave, and beat my sin
That I might know the life You give
You've called me in to know the God
That flung the stars, and yet holds my heart

Oh Great Light come, shine Your great love
Let it soak to the depths of me and rule my heart
And till the day when my time's up
Oh Jesus come, shine Your great love

Come wake me up, come stir my soul
Come move and breathe, and make me whole

Now I am Yours, my heart's content
Forsaking all to be Your friend
So let me love the things You love
And walk in faith, and not give up"
