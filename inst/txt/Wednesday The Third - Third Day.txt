Third Day

Now as I lay by your side
would you tell me why everything has to be lies
leaving everyone wondering when we'll all wind up dead
to all we are within
wednesday the third was the night that you rambled
alone in the fridgid white light like a leopard
about to dig in to trembling skin
with wind whipping your shins

Oh
haven't you heard the news
nobody came too soon
surprise our eyes are opening up to you

Now as I lean to the side
I can see all the thoughts that you're trying to hide
I've arranged for a ferry to France
where you should relax, don't worry about the pets
they'll be safe at our address

Oh
haven't you heard the news
nobody came too soon
surprise our eyes are opening up to you
nobody came too soon
surprise our eyes are opening up to you
you'll always be in our eyes opening up to you

you've left everyone wondering when we'll all end up dead
to all we are within
now as daisies dry off
and the wind scurries scarlet leaves like they were dust
we can see somewhere off to the east
a gaggle of geese are singing your goodbye
hear the sweetest lullaby
listen up to hear the sky will soon clear
and you'll be the last one to wish for rain"
