Youthful Praise

When I think of the goodness of Jesus
and all he's done for me. My soul cries out HAL-LE-LU-JAH.
I thank God for saving me cause you don't know like I know what the
Lord has done for me. He picked me up, turned me around, and gave
me victory. From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same
His name is worthy to be praised, worthy to be praised.
(Repeat Chorus)
(Bridge)
He's the first and He's the last.
Omnipotent and awesome in His mighty acts.
I praise Him for He's wonderful.
He's excellent and glorious. There's none like
Him, there's none like Him

(Vamp)
I give my life
My all to Christ.
My hands I'll raise
He's worthy to be praised (Repeat as Directed)
From the rising of the sun, to the going down of the same
His name is worthy to be (4x)
Worthy to be praised (Repeat as directed)"
