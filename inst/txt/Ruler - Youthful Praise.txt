Chorus:
Hail Jesus, You're the King
Master over everything
You are Elyon, You sit high
And look low, You're in control
Oh, oh, oh, OH.....oooo

Verse:
You're the Master of the sky
You're the Master of the earth
You're the Master of the sea
And I praise Him 'cause I know
That He sees and knows and cares

Chorus

Vamp:
You're the ruler of everything before me
You're the ruler of everything above me
You're the ruler of everything behind me
You're the ruler of everything around me

Troubles come, You're the ruler of everything
Situations come, You're the ruler of everything
Persecution comes, You're the ruler of everything"
