"1" "I Remember You
Third Day

I remember You
And I remember that Your body was broken
And I remember that Your blood was spilled
I remember that You didn't have to do it

And I remember You
And I remember that Your body was broken
And I remember how they pierced Your side
Then You defied death and You ascend - ed in - to the sky"
