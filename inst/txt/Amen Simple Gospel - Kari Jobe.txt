"1" "Amen (Simple Gospel)
Kari Jobe

I believe that Christ is my Savior
All for love He plundered my heart from the grave
This is the simple gospel
I believe that Christ is Redeemer
All for love He settled the payment of sin
This is the simple gospel
It will never ever change

Let the church say amen
Let the church say amen
Death is defeated
Jеsus is risen
This is our faith
The good news of gracе
Oh let the church say amen

I believe that Christ is returning
Evermore His Spirit is living in me
This is the simple gospel
It will never ever change

Let the church say amen
Let the church say amen
Death is defeated
Jesus is risen
This is our faith
The good news of grace
Oh let the church say amen

The lost will come home
The bound will go free
The weak will be strong
The broken redeemed
The sick will be well
The hungry will feast
The mourning will dance
The blinded will see
The church will arise
With power and love
Our cities will know
The glory of God
The future is bright
There's nothing to fear
Revival is now
The Kingdom is here

Let the church say amen
Let the church say amen
Death is defeated
Jesus is risen
This is our faith
The good news of grace
Oh let the church say amen
Let the church say amen
Let the church say amen
Death is defeated
Jesus is risen
This is our faith
The good news of grace
Oh let the church say amen

The lost will come home
The bound will go free
The weak will be strong
The broken redeemed
The sick will be well
The hungry will feast
The mourning will dance
The blinded will see
The church will arise
With power and love
Our cities will know
The glory of God
The future is bright
There's nothing to fear
Revival is now
The Kingdom is here
Sing it out!
The lost will come home
The bound will go free
The weak will be strong
The broken redeemed
The sick will be well
The hungry will feast
The mourning will dance
The blinded will see
Come on!
The church will arise
With power and love
Our cities will know
The glory of God
The future is bright
There's nothing to fear
Revival is now
The Kingdom is here

Let the church say amen
Let the church say amen
