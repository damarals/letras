"1" "Murdered Love
P.O.D.

The death sentence, capital punishment
Give to blood-shed, convict the innocent
Eradicate the witness
Lynch the first, slaughter the last

Exterminate the absolute
Stain the just in the blood bath
And easte the pure, butcher the divine
Annihilate the sunrise

And he was numbered with the transgressors
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered love

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered love

Eliminate the infinite
Snuff the light and finish the truth
Kill the immaculate
Condemn beautiful virtue
Assassination of individual redemption
Obliteration of this undeniable one

And he was numbered with the transgressors
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered love

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered love

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered love

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered love

Remember me when you step into your glory
Don't forget me when you step into your glory
Remember me when you step into your glory
Don't forget me when you step into your glory

Your glory!
The day that they murdered

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered love

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered love

The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered
The day that they murdered love"
