Hillsong United

Our Father, everlasting
The all creating one
God almighty

Through your Holy Spirit
Conceiving Christ, the Son
Jesus, our saviour

I believe in God, our Father
I believe in Christ, the Son
I believe in the Holy Spirit
Our God is three in one

I believe in the resurrection
That we will rise again
For I believe in the name of Jesus

Our judge and our defender
Suffered, and crucified
Forgiveness is in You

Descended into darkness
You rose in glorious life
Forever seated high

I believe in God, our Father
I believe in Christ, the Son
I believe in the Holy Spirit
Our God is three in one

I believe in the resurrection
That we will rise again
For I believe in the name of Jesus

I believe in You
I believe you rose again
I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord

I believe in You
I believe you rose again
I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord

I believe in God, our Father
I believe in Christ, the Son
I believe in the Holy Spirit
Our God is three in one

I believe in the resurrection
That we will rise again
For I believe in the name of Jesus

I believe in God, our Father
I believe in Christ, the Son
I believe in the Holy Spirit
Our God is three in one

I believe in the resurrection
That we will rise again
For I believe in the name of Jesus

For I believe in the name of Jesus
For I believe in the name of Jesus

I believe in life eternal
I believe in the virgin birth
I believe in the saints' communion
And in Your holy church

I believe in the resurrection
When Jesus comes again
For I believe in the name of Jesus

I believe in God, our Father
I believe in Christ, the Son
I believe in the Holy Spirit
Our God is three in one

I believe in the resurrection
That we will rise again
For I believe in the name of Jesus

I believe in God, our Father
I believe in Christ, the Son
I believe in the Holy Spirit
Our God is three in one

I believe in the resurrection
That we will rise again
For I believe in the name of Jesus
For I believe in the name of Jesus"
