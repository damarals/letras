Skillet

[Verse 1]
Do you ever wish that you weren't a prisoner?
Do you feel like you're done?
All the dreams you had are hard to remember
Well, you're not the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
Well it's over, it's over, it's over
I won't be pushed around
Move over, move over, move over
Get back or just get out
Set this plane up in flames
It's over, it's over, it's over
It's time to burn it down
[Chorus]
This one goes to the castaways
Who break their backs slaving every day
All these things I can do without
Gotta burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down

[Verse 2]
Do you ever feel your colors are fading
Like your world might combust
Do the voices in your head make you crazy
When they're the only ones you trust

[Pre-Chorus]
Well it's over, it's over, it's over
I won't be pushed around
Move over, move over, move over
Get back or just get out
Set this plane up in flames
It's over, it's over, it's over
It's time to burn it down

[Chorus]
This one goes to the castaways
Who break their backs slaving every day
All these things I can do without
Gotta burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down

[Bridge]
It's over, it's over, it's over
Move over, move over, move over
It's over, it's over, it's over
I won't be pushed around
Move over, move over, move over
Burn it down, burn it down

[Chorus]
This one goes to the castaways
Who break their backs slaving every day
All these things I can do without
Gotta burn it down, burn it down

[Outro]
Burn it down, burn it down
(I won't be pushed around)
Burn it down, burn it down
(Get back or just get out)
Burn it down, burn it down
(I won't be pushed around)
Burn it down, burn it down
(Get back or just get out)
Burn it down, burn it down"
