"1" "You Brought Me Home
Hillsong United

Your name, oh Lord, endures forever/ Your fame, oh Lord, for all the time/ Your presence, Lord will leave me never/Your Love, oh lord, is all mine

To whom by wisdom made to the heavens/And His mercy everlasting/ To the One who gives salvation/ I lift up my soul to You

Jesus Saviour holy Lord/I know that You'll never forsake me/Or leave me alone/My Redeemer, Jesus Christ/ You sacrified Yourself on the cross/ To bring me home/You brought me home"
