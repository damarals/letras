"x"
"1" "Cycle Down
Skillet

(Verse 1:)
Crashing
Covered with debris
Dwelling in my own pity
Cry like I have not
Dig like I had not
I start to claw
Gotta get outta here
I've got, gotta get out

(Chorus:)
I am, I am, I am on a higher ground
You are, you are the cure from the cycle down

(Verse 2:)
Sinking
In a sea of self
Deception
Never sold so well
Regret like I have not
Pain like I don't want
I start to claw
Gotta get outta here
I've got, gotta get out

(Bridge:)
I'm so cold and I wonder
How'd I make it this long without you
Pull me out, out from under
On the cycle back to you"
