"x"
"1" "Goin' Thru the Motions
Michael W. Smith

Words & Music: Michael W. Smith and Wayne Kirkpatrick

Actions have been justified
All is compromised
Looking for approval there
In someone else's eyes, oh
Dodging all you really are
Becomes your greatest task
Acting out your lonely part
You hide behind your mask
Bridge:
Never true to yourself
Knowing well this is not like you
Fooling yourself
You're just living a lie

Chorus:
Goin' goin'
Goin' thru the motions
Goin' goin'
Goin' thru the motions
Goin' goin'
Goin' thru the motions
Goin' goin'
Goin' thru the motions

Victim of the circumstance
Prisoner of the shame
But it's the double standard life
That keeps you in the game
Taken by your own disguise
But when it's wearing thin
You'll do anything it takes
To impress your friends

Bridge:
Never true to yourself
This is not what you want to be
Fooling yourself
You're just living lie

Chorus
