"1" "American President
Delirious

America you're too young to cry
And England you're too old to die
I need my brothers and my wife
To vote me into my new life
Oh yeah

I'm gonna be the American President
With the money that my parents lent
I'm gonna rule the world
I'm leaving England to be the President
I'm under cover for her Majesty
We're gonna save the world

America you took all the pies
England your summers make me cry
I think its time for me to have a spouse
So she can clean this big white house
Oh yeah

I'm gonna be the American President...

Ladies and Gentleman of America
This is your new president speaking
I declare every day a holiday
And God has told me
That rock music is of God

I'm gonna be your President
With the money that my parents lent
I'm gonna rule the world
I left England to be your President
I'm under cover for her Majesty
We're gonna save the world

I'm gonna be your President
Your money was very well spent
Gonna save the world
I left England to be the President
I'm under cover for her Majesty
We're gonna save the world
I'm gonna save the world
God save the President"
