"1" "Better Than Life
Vineyard

In this dry and weary land
Nothing satisfies
Hear the longing of my soul
Your love is better than life
Your love is better than life, my Lord

(And) all my earthly treasures fade
When I see You shine
In Your presence I am home
Your love is better than life
Your love is better than life
Your love is better than life
Your love is better than life

And I will sing Your praise
Glorify Your name
Bowing low to kiss Your feet
And I will sing Your praise
Glorify Your name
Cause You have touched my heart
And filled me with Your love
Your love...
Your love rains down..."
