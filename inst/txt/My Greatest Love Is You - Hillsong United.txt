"1" "My Greatest Love Is You
Hillsong United

Every new day
Your glory unfolds
Filling my eyes
With Your treasures untold
The beauty of holiness
Brings worship anew
My greatest love is You
Call me deeper
Into Your grace
The river that flows
From the Holy Place
Wash over me
Cleansing me through
My greatest love is You"
