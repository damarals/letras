"1" "What Is This Thing Called Love?
Delirious

Looking into yesterday and all the dreams
that heaven sent.
Maybe love will come our way
And when I stand upon the land I threw
the dreams into the sea
Maybe they will rise again

And maybe, maybe love will come our way
And maybe hope will come to us again

What is this thing called love
I know I've found it, it's in your eyes
What is this thing called love
I know I've found it, it's in your eyes

Looking to the 'morrows dreams
And all the secrets that they hold
Patiently waiting for these days
And when I look into the sky I see that
hope is coming soon
Praying love will come again

And maybe, maybe love will come our way
And maybe hope will come to us again"
