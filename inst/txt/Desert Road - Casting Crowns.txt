Casting Crowns

I don't wanna write this song
I don't want this pain to be my story
I don't want this desert road
Are You sure this is the plan that You have for me?
Out here in the dust and clay
God, if there's a bigger picture
It's gettin' hard to see today
But I know that You won't leave me here

I don't know where this is goin'
But I know who holds my hand
It's not the path I would've chosen
But I'll follow You to the end
Lord, as long as I am breathin'
I will make Your glory known
Even if it means I'm walkin' on this desert road

(Where You lead me, I will follow)
On this desert road
(Wherе You lead me, I will follow)

You got my attention now
I was doin' thе talkin', but now I'm listenin'
This is where my hope is found
Knowin' life is hard, but You're still with me
I'm not out here on my own
You are close to the broken-hearted
'Cause You've already walked this road
And You're gonna finish what You started

I don't know where this is goin'
But I know who holds my hand
It's not the path I would've chosen
But I'll follow You to the end
Lord, as long as I am breathin'
I will make Your glory known
Even if it means I'm walkin' on this desert road

(Where You lead me, I will follow)
On this desert road
(Where You lead me, I will follow)

(Where You lead me, I will follow)
As you lift my head, I see
(Where You lead me, I will follow)
So many desperate souls in need
(Where You lead me, I will follow)
I'll walk with them as You walk with me
(Where You lead me, I will follow)
You're the livin' water to the thirsty

I don't know where this is goin'
But I know who holds my hand
It's not the path I would've chosen
But I'll follow You to the end
Lord, as long as I am breathin'
I will make Your glory known
Even if it means I'm walkin' on this desert road

(Where You lead me, I will follow)
On this desert road
(Where You lead me, I will follow)
So many desperate souls in need
(Where You lead me, I will follow)
I'll walk with them as You walk with me
(Where You lead me, I will follow)"
