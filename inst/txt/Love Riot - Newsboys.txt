Newsboys

[Intro]
Oh, whoa-a-a-a
Whoa-a-a-a
Whoa-a-a-a

[Verse 1]
If these streets could talk
They'd tell us things
Of shattered hearts and wars unseen
It's a battle we can't win alone
We need saving desperately
He made a way, said, \"Follow Me
\"Give up your life for something more\"

[Chorus]
Oh, what are we waiting for?
Let's take it around the world
Let's start a fire
And join the fight in this love riot
Oh, ready, set here we go
From London to Tokyo\"
You gotta unite and join the fight
In this love riot

[Verse 2]
We are an army of the truth
We're on the march to rescue you
Don't have to make it on your own
We're holy rebels, and when we yell
The mountains fall, the oceans swell
This is the time to let them know

[Chorus]
Oh, what are we waiting for?
Let's take it around the world
Let's start a fire
And join the fight in this love riot
Oh, ready, set here we go
From London to Tokyo
We gotta unite and join the fight
In this love riot

[Verse 3]
We'll take to the streets, yeah
We'll take to the streets
Exploding with love
He's already won this, already won this
We'll take to the streets, yeah
We'll take to the streets
Exploding with love
We've already won this, already won this

[Bridge]
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?

[Chorus 2]
Oh, what are we waiting for?
Let's take it around the world
Let's start a fire
And join the fight in this love riot
Oh, ready, set here we go
From New York to Tokyo
We gotta unite and join the fight
In this love riot

[The end]
Oh, whoa-a-a-a, whoa-a-a-a
Oh, whoa-a-a-a
Join the fight in this love riot
Oh, whoa-a-a-a, whoa-a-a-a
Oh, whoa-a-a-a
Join the fight in this love riot
Oh, oh, oh"
