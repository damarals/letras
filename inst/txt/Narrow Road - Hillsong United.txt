Hillsong United

Verse 1:
We walk on this narrow road
Now restored as one we walk
In Your hope

Verse 2:
And though darkness fills our path
Fear wont fix its hold on us
For we know

PreChorus:
Love will shine before us on our path
And guide our every step within the dark
To know You is our only cry
Knowing You our only cry
Our God

Verse 3:
We beg tidings of Your hope
Freedom from the sinner plight
Through Your love

Verse 4:
Our eyes set upon this task
Truth in hand as one we walk
We advance

Chorus:
So Lord here we are with humbled hearts
To see Your will be done
Let love shape to Your own design
To bear our maker's sign"
