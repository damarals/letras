"1" "Back To The Cross
Vineyard

Child of My heart
I will not forget you
See in My hands
Are the marks of My love

Come and receive
Of the grace I have promised
My love is for you
And I draw you
Back to the place you belong

Back to the cross
Where you are forgiven
Back to the cross
In My blood washed clean
Back to the cross
My death for your freedom
My love will draw you
Back to the cross"
