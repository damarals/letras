Vineyard

I long to know you
Only you can satisfy
I long to touch you
Only you can heal my life

I can't find peace in the things I do
I need to see your kingdom
I can't find peace as I strive for you
I need to see your face

Hold me in Your arms
And never let me run away
Hold me in your arms my Father
Say you'll stay, say you'll stay"
