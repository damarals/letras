"1" "All You Are
Hillsong United

Here I am again
Hungry after you my Lord
Here I wait on You
Longing for Your touch
Right here, right now

You are my song, my joy
I bring this offering of all that I am

All You are is wonderful
All You are is beautiful
Here I worship at Your feet my Lord
And lavish You with praise

Jesus you are mine
Tenderness your eyes
Love captured me
I am overwhelmed
That You've forgiven me
You said: \"go and be clean\"

All You are is wonderful
All You are is beautiful
Here I worship at Your feet my Lord
And lavish You with praise
All You are is all I need
Your forgiveness I received
You have washed me clean with your own blood

And now I'm Yours
And now I'm Yours
Completely Yours
And all my heart
And all my praise is Yours..."
