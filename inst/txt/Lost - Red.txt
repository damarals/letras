"1" "Lost
Red

Can I be dreaming once again?
I'm reaching helpless I descend
You lead me deeper through this maze
I'm not afraid, I'm

(Chorus)
Lost in you
Everywhere I run
Everywhere I turn
I'm finding something new
Lost in you
Something I can't fight
I could not escape
I could spend my life
Lost in you

Your whispers fill these empty halls
I'm searching for you as you call
I'm racing, chasing after you
I need you more I'm

(Chorus)

I could never be the same
It's something that I
Never could erase
I could never look away
I've lost myself
In you
It's all over now
Lost in you
Everywhere I run
Lost in you
Everywhere I run
Lost in you
Lost in you"
