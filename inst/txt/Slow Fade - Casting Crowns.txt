Casting Crowns

Be careful little eyes what you see
It's the second glance that ties your hands
As darkness pulls the strings

Be careful little feet where you go
For it's the little feet behind you
that are sure to follow

It's a slow fade
when you give yourself away
It's a slow fade
when black and white are turned to gray
And thoughts invade, choices are made
a price will be paid when you give yourself away
People never crumble in a day
It's a slow fade, it's a slow fade

Be careful little ears what you hear
When flattering leads to compromises
the end is always near

Be careful little lips what you say
For empty words and promises
leave broken hearts astray

It's a slow fade
when you give yourself away
It's a slow fade
when black and white are turned to gray
And thoughts invade, choices are made
a price will be paid when you give yourself away
People never crumble in a day
It's a slow fade

The journey from your mind to your hands
Is shorter than you're thinking
Be careful if you think you stand
You just might be sinking

It's a slow fade
when you give yourself away
It's a slow fade
when black and white are turned to gray
And thoughts invade, choices are made
a price will be paid
When you give yourself away

People never crumble in a day
Daddies never crumble in a day
Families never crumble in a day

Oh, be careful little eyes what you see
Oh, be careful little eyes what you see
For the Father up above is looking down in love
Oh, be careful little eyes what you see"
