Skillet

All alone, lost in this abyss
Crawling in the dark
Nothing to wipe my longing clips
And I wonder where you are
Are You far?
Will You come to my rescue?
Am I left to die but I can't give up on You

I feel You keeping me alive
You are my salvation
Touch You, taste You, feel You here
I feel You keeping me alive
You are my salvation
Hold me, heal me, keep me near
My heart will burn for You
It's all I can do

Salvation
Salvation
Keeping me alive
Salvation
Keeping me
Salvation
Keeping me alive

Been out from under who I am
And who I wanna be
Held You tightly in my hand
While we unraveling
Was it me? Will You come to my rescue?
Or did I push too far when I turned my back on You?

I feel you keeping me alive
You are my salvation
Touch You, taste You, feel You here
I feel You keeping me alive
You are my salvation
Hold me, heal me, keep me near
My heart will burn for You
It's all I can do

Salvation
Salvation
Keeping me alive
Salvation

Touch You, taste You
Feel You, need You
Give it all just to find You
Hold me, heal me
I will find You

Keeping me alive
You are my salvation
Touch You, taste You, feel You here
Our love will never die
You are my salvation
Hold me, heal me, keep me near
My heart will burn for You
It's all I can do

Salvation
Salvation
Touch You, taste You
Feel You, need You
Salvation"
