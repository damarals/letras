"1" "Lord Reign In Me
Delirious

Over all the earth You reign on high
Every mountain stream, every sunset sky
But my one request, Lord my only aim
Is that You reign in me again

Lord reign in me, reign in Your power
Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour
You are the Lord of all I am
So want You reign in me again

Over every thought, over every word
May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord
Cause You mean more to me than any earthly thing
So want You reign in me again"
