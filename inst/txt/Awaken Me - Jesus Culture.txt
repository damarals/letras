Jesus Culture

Let our praise be how we fill this place,
O king of glory, touch our cities and fill your people
A new day dawning, you are shining like the sun arising
You awaken me, you awaken me

Eyes to see, ears to hear your calling
Our hearts respond to your spirit calling

You're awakening our hearts to your kingdom
Heaven is falling as we are declaring your name
We sing aloud with all of our passion
King of glory, come and fill this place

Let our lights be a full reflection of you
King of glory, shine your light on us your people
A new song rising joined by the sound of heaven's praise
You awaken me, you awaken me

Eyes to see, ears to hear your calling
Our hearts respond to your spirit calling

You're awakening our hearts to your kingdom
Heaven is falling as we are declaring your name
We sing aloud with all of our passion
King of glory, come and fill this place

Come like you promised
Come fall upon us

You're awakening our hearts to your kingdom
Heaven is falling as we are declaring your name
We sing aloud with all of our passion
King of glory, come and fill this place

Come like you promised
Come fall upon us"
