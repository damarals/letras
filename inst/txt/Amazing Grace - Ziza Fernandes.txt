"1" "Amazing Grace
Ziza Fernandes

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I’m found
Was blind, but now I see

It was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Whem we’re been there tem thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We’re o less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun"
