"1" "My Jesus, My Savior
Michael W. Smith

My Jesus, My Savior
Lord, there is none like You
All of my days
I want to praise
the wonders of Your mighty love

My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strenght
let every breath, all that I am
never cease to worship You

Shout to the Lord, all the earth
Let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of Your name

I sing for joy at the work of Your hands
Forever I'll love You
Forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have in you"
