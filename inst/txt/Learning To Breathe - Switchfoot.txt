Switchfoot

Hello, good morning, how you doin'?
What makes your risin' sun so new?
I could use a fresh beginning too
All of my regrets are nothing new
So this is a way, that I say I need you
This is a way

This is a way that I'm learning to breathe
I'm learning to crawl
I'm finding that you and you alone
Can break my fall
I'm living again, awake and alive
I'm dying to breathe in these abundant skies

Hello, good moring, how you been?
Yesterday left my head kicked in
I never, never thought that
I would fall like that
Never knew that I could hurt this bad

I'm learning to breathe
I'm learning to crawl
I'm finding that you and you alone
Can break my fall
I'm living again, awake and alive
I'm dying to breathe in these abundant skies
These abundant skies
Yeah, abundant skies, yeah

This is a way that I say I need you
This is a way that I say I love you
This is a way that I say I'm yours
This is a way

This a the way that I'm learning to breathe
I'm learning to crawl
I'm finding that you and you alone
Can break my fall
I'm living again, awake and alive
I'm dying to breathe in these abundant skies
These abundant skies, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm learning to breathe
I'm dying to breathe in thes abundant skies
Hello, good morning, how you doin'?"
