I wanna hear you scream

I hear the cry
The helpless lie
Innocence unfolds (Unfolds)
You let me take
You let me break out
Purify your soul (Your soul)

Come to me, come with me
Don't let anything inside
Come under, underneath
I can't let go now, I can't let go

Running away
But it's over now
Surrender my prey
Oh, my infidel
My infidel

Now I wanna hear you scream

Closer now
A beggar's crown
A saint and a slave
The throne you made
Keeps you in chains
So obey, obey

Come to me, come with me
I can't control anything inside
Come under, underneath
I can't let go now, I can't let go

Running away
But it's over now
Surrender my prey
Oh, my infidel
My infidel

I wanna hear you scream

You make me believe
You make me believe
You make me believe

Fear of the fear
It's only fear of the fear
Pain, oh, the pain
It's coming
I'll make it real
I'll make itâ€”

Running away
But it's over now
Surrender my prey
Oh, my infidel
My infidel

Now I wanna hear you scream

Scream"
