Take 6

Chorus:
Sonshine, Sonshine, Sonshine
Means your flowers are gonna bloom again
Sonshine, Sonshine, Sonshine
Means your flowers are gonna bloom again (gonna bloom x4)

Now the Son can lift your feet off the ground
Make you fell so good you never want to come down
Put wind beneath your wings every time He's around
That's what the Son can do (oh!)

He can turn your wrong into right
Like a candle in your darkest night
Give you strength to run if you walk in the light (yeah)
That's what the Son can do

Chorus
(Gonna bloom again)

He can loose the life in your seed
Send a ray of hope to meet your every need
Break the yoke of sin and make you free indeed
Oh that's what the Son can do

He can teach you things that you never did know
Prosper every seed that you never could sow
He can give the power for your flower to grow
Oh (the) Son can do

Chorus
(Gonna bloom again 2x)

Bridge:
Oh don't be dismayed by the clouds (passing over)
It's just a temporary method for the rain to fall
Every drop of rain is allowed (little bit o'rain y'all)
So that you can appreciate the coming of the Sonshine
(Coming over the horizon) Sonshine, oh the Sonshine
(Bringing healing for your feeling)
Son - love that Sonshine

Chorus
Repeat

Ad libs:
Oh love it, Sonshine, makes everything better
Heal your mind with Sonshine"
