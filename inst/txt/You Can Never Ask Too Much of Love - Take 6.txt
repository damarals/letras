"x"
"1" "You Can Never Ask Too Much (of Love)
Take 6

Love has got the perfect plan
I've finally come to understand
You can never ask too much of love

Love forgives your greatest sin
With open arms to let you in
You can never ask too much of love

I know… there's one thing I'm always sure of
It's the purest emotion we have
Love is… one never ending circle
That brings us around to face ourselves

Chorus

I will never turn my back on you again
I wont deny how hard you've tried and all you've been
Time and time again, I found this truth will always last
You can never ask too much of love

In an ordinary heart
The extra ordinary part is
You can never ask too much of love

There's no time, no way to measure
Love's an open, endless treasure
You can never ask too much of love

I know… there's one thing I'm always sure of
It's the purest emotion we have
Love is… one never ending circle
That brings us around to face ourselves

Chorus"
