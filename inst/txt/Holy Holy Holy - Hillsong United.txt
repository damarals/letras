Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty
Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee.
Holy, Holy, Holy merciful and mighty
God in three persons blessed Trinity

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
O what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.

This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long.

Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long.

Perfect submission, all is at rest;
I in my Savior am happy and blest,
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with his goodness, lost in his love.

This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long.

Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God almighty
All thy works shall praise Thy name in earth sky and sea.
Holy, Holy, Holy merciful and mighty
God in three persons blessed Trinity

Holy we cry holy (x4)"
