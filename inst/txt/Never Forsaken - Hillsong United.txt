"1" "Never Forsaken
Hillsong United

Find me with open arms
Pull me towards your heart
Swept away in the tides of your spirit
Your hope will not resign
Your grace cannot run dry
I will dive into you

And for all my days
In your shadow I will remain
Oh I could stay here forever
By your side
I know you won't shy away
I am never forsaken

In dark and sleepless nights
To you I'm holding tight
I will rest in the depths of your mercy
You drench my weary soul
Your spirit overflows
Here I soak in your love

And for all my days
In your shadow I will remain
Oh I could stay here forever
By your side
I know you won't shy away
I am never forsaken

I'm covered by your love
It's surging in my heart
Forever I am found in you my God
My feet had wandered far
But now I'm where you are
Forever I am found in you my God

And for all my days
In your shadow I will remain
Oh I could stay here forever
By your side
I know you won't shy away
I am never forsaken"
