"1" "Everything is Possible
Miss√£o Doulos

How wonderful is the life
By your side

I may pass for the troubles
I may pass for this bridge with joy
For I know you give me strength
For I know the spring is coming
Starting a new time here

I open my window
I wanna see the sun shining on my face
It's like a sweet breathing
Refreshing my mind that
I can try it all again

Everything is possible
Only believe"
