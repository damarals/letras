"1" "I Will Choose To Praise You
Mariana Valadão

I will choose to praise You
With everything that’s in me
I’m laying down my pride filled heart
So it won’t hold me back

I give You all that I am
My life I place in Your hands
For Your worship I was made
To give my life in praise to You

So I choose the song of heaven
And I choose a “Hallelujah”
For You are high above
Anything that turns my love from You

I am Your creation
Made to give You glory
So I’m finding every way I can
To serve You, Lord
To serve You, Lord

So I choose the song of heaven
And I choose a “Hallelujah”
For You are high above
Anything that turns my love from You
And with every road before me
I will choose the path that’s costly
For You are high above
Anything that turns my love from You

Give me a heart that is only devoted to You
Undivided and faithful to all that is true
Determined to see Your Kingdom breakthrough,
Breakthrough"
