"1" "Arise Oh Lord
Vineyard

Hear us Lord
Hear us now, Lord have mercy
Hear our prayer
Hear our cry for revival

Release your power
Break our chains, set us free
Let us feel
Your joy again, set us free
Lord, come heal us

Arise oh Lord
Demonstrate your power
Arise, oh Lord
Demonstrate your power
Demonstrate your power"
