Turn around they might be watching
And you never disappoint them
Hide your innocence before they see right through
You mustn't disappoint them

You need the danger just to feel your heart beat
You need to die just to find your identity
You need the knife just to know that you can bleed
You need the pain now just to feel anything

We fall in line
We live the lie
Give up, give up and feed the machine
It grows inside
Nowhere to hide
Give up, give up and feed the machine
Give up, give up and feed the machine

Keep moving faster the gate is closing
And you never fall behind
So choose a face your only calling out
You mustn't fall behind

You need to live again just to have a legacy
You need a master just so you can beg
You need to lie because your so afraid
Now bow down and learn to be a good slave

We fall in line
We live the lie
Give up, give up and feed the machine
It grows inside
Nowhere to hide
Give up, give up and feed the machine
Give up, give up and feed the machine

And now you want to sleep
And now you want to sleep

Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

We fall in line
We live the lie
Give up, give up and feed the machine
It grows inside
Nowhere to hide
Wake up, wake up and kill the machine

Wake up, wake up and kill the machine
Wake up, wake up and kill the machine"
