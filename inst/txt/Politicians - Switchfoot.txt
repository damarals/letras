Switchfoot

(Oh, Oh, Oh,)

Everything is broken,
Everything is broken,
Everything is breaking down, breaking down

Everything is bleeding,
Everything is bleeding,
Everything is breaking down, breaking down

I pledge allegiance to a country without borders,
Without Politicians,
Watching for my sky to get torn apart

We are broken, we are bitter, we're the problem,
We're the Politicians,
Watching for our sky to get torn apart

(Come on and break me)

Entropy and aching,
Where have we been aiming?
Everything is fading now,
Fading now

We are the faded,
Splintered and sedated
Everything is fading now,
Fading now

I pledge allegiance to a country without borders,
Without Politicians,
Watching for my sky to get torn apart

We are broken, we are bitter, we're the problem,
We're the Politicians,
Watching for our sky to get torn apart

(Come on and break me)
(Come on and break me)

Oh!
Oh!

I pledge allegiance to a country without borders,
Without Politicians,
Politicians,
Politicians,

I am broken, I am bitter!
I'm the problem, I'm the Politician,
Watching for my sky to get torn apart

(Come on and break me)
(Come on and break me)"
