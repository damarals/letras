"x"
"1" "Walk By Faith
Jeremy Camp

Will I believe you when you would say
Your hand will guide my every way
Will I receive the words You say
Every moment of every day

Chorus
Well I will walk by faith
Even when I cannot see it
Well because this broken road
Prepares Your will for me

Help me to win my endless fears
You've been so faithful for all my years
With the one breath You make me new
Your grace covers all I do

yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ya

[Chorus]
Well I will walk by faith
Even when I cannot see it
Well because this broken road
Prepares Your will for me

Well I'm broken- but I still see Your face
Well You've spoken- pouring Your words of grace

Well hallelujah, hallelu
(I will walk by faith)
Well hallelujah, hallelu
(I will walk by faith)

I will walk, I will walk, I will walk by faith
I will, I will, I will walk by faith

Well hallelujah, hallelu
Well hallelujah, hallelu
Well hallelujah, hallelu
Well hallelujah, hallelu"
