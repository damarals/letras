"1" "We've Got Today
Dominic Balli

We've got today
We might not have another
No guarantee tomorrow's gonna come
We got today
My sister and my brother
Could all of us together make a change
No time to waste
Sunshine or rain
We've got today

So let's live like it's now or never
Love like we just can't lose
Give like it's our last hour
And dream 'til it all comes true

We've got today
And we've only got one
Imagine all that it could become
We've got today
Our chapter's just begun
What story will they tell when we're gone
No time to waste
Sunshine or rain
We've got today
Take a look around you
Tell me what you see
Are we gonna leave it all the same
Only we can write it
It's our own history
Oh oh oh
We've got today"
