"1" "Edge Of My Seat
Toby Mac

Well I thought that I had seen most everything
And if jaded was a people, I'd be the king
So cold to what a brand-new day could bring
So icy cold to all the wonder that should be moving me
But then came You
Hot like June
I'm jumping out my skin just tryin' to catch the view

You got me on the edge
Got me on the edge of my seat
You got me on the edge
I am on the edge of my seat

Lost all my worries
Feels like Christmas came early
Yeah, I could stay here day and night and never feel no hurry
Needless to mention, Lord, You got my attention
My eyes are wide with wonder pheenin' for this soul ascension
'Cause no one else is ever gonna do for me
Ever gonna do for me, what You do for me, yeah
Ain't no one ever gonna steal the mystery
You put right in front of me
Right in front of me, yeah

You are opening my eyes, Lord
Opening my eyes, Lord
To brand new possibilities"
