"1" "Here I Am To Worship/call
Hillsong United

Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Open my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You

Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You are my God
You’re altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days, oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above,
Humbly you came
To the earth You created
All for love’s sake became poor

I’ll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon the cross

Call upon the Name of the Lord
And be saved"
