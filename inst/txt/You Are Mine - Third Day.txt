"1" "You Are Mine
Third Day

It doesn’t take much
For my heart to break
And you have done it
For what’s seems the millionth time

Whenever I hear
Of your saving grace
And how you gave your life
In exchange for mine

Sometimes I wonder why you even love me
And why you ever chose to call me child
Then I remember
It’s by your sacrifice
I can say that
I am yours and you are mine

It doesn’t take much
For me to shed a tear
And you have done so many things
To make me cry
Whenever I think
Of all that I’ve done wrong
And everything that you have done
To make it right

It doesn’t take much
For my heart to break
And you have done it
For what’s seems the millionth time"
