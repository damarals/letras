When I open my eyes, I can't believe it
How the world can look so different
than we were dreamin'
It's gettin' harder to say I'm undefeated
When the best my heart can hope for
is breakin' even

Here and now, reachin' out
In my hurt, I don't know how
But I know I'm not alone

I can face my darkest night
'Cause I trust You with my life
I'm not afraid for You are my refuge
When it's heavy on my chest
You're the place I catch my breath
You are the only one I hold onto

Oh, 'cause You are my refuge

I know how this ends
I'm gonna make it
Your Word is in my heart
None could ever take it

Here and now, hear us out
Come and fill me with Your power
Let me know I'm not alone

I can face my darkest night
'Cause I trust You with my life
I'm not afraid for You are my refuge
When it's heavy on my chest
You're the place I catch my breath
You are the only one I hold onto

Every day and darkest night (Night)
I trust You at all times (Trust You at all times)
I'm not afraid for You are my refuge
And when I've got nothin' left (Got nothin' left)
You're the place I find my rest
(Place I find my rest)
You are the only one that I run to

Yes, You are my refuge

You're my rest, You're my rock, You're my fortress
You're my strength, You're my shield and You're my defense
Nothing could ever take me from You
Nothin's ever gonna take me from You

I can face my darkest night
'Cause I trust You with my life
I'm not afraid for You are my refuge
When it's heavy on my chest
You're the place I catch my breath
You are the only one I hold onto

Every day and darkest night (Darkest night)
I trust You at all times (Trust You at all times)
I'm not afraid for You are my refuge
And when I've got nothin' left (Got nothin' left)
You're the place I find my rest
(Place I find my rest)
You are the only one that I run to

Yes, You are my refuge"
