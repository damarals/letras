"x"
"1" "Everywhere I Go
Amy Grant

I was wasting time
Oh so sure to find
Somebody who'll never go.
How could I know?
None I found was true.
None could be but you, you're
The only one love divine
My heart, my mind
Are yours

(chorus)
Everwhere I go
I see your face through the crowd
Everywhere I go
I hear your voice clear and loud
Everywhere I go
You are the light that I see
Everywhere I go
You have found me

Where could my heart go
Where you wouldn't know to find me?
Far far from here
Still you are near
To me
chorus

I have seen you in the evening
In the morning light
You hold me closer than the air aruond me
You surround me
Always.
chorus repeats as fades out
