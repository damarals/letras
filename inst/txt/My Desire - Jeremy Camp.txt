"1" "My Desire
Jeremy Camp

You want to be real
You want to be empty inside
You want to be someone laying down your pride
You want to be someone someday
Then lay it all down before the King
You want to be whole
You want to have purpose inside
You want to have virtue and purify your mind
You want to be set free today then lay it all down before the King

Chorus:
This is my desire
This is my return
This is my desire to be used by you

You want to be real
You want to be emptied inside
And I know my heart is to feel you near
And I know my life
It's to do your will
It's to do your will

(Chorus)

All my life
I have seen
where you've
taken me
Beyond all I have hoped
and there's more left unseen
There's not much
I can do to repay
all you've done
so I give my hands to use

(Chorus)"
