"1" "You Hold Me Now
Hillsong United

On the day when I see
All that you have for me
When I see you face to face
Then surrounded by your grace

All my fears swept away
In the light of your embrace
Where your love is all I need
and forever I am free

Where the streets are made of gold
and your presence heal me whole
Let the songs of heaven rise to you alone

[chorus]
No weeping
No hurt or pain
No suffering
You hold me now
You hold me now

No darkness
No sick or lame
No hiding
You hold me now
You hold me now

In this life I would stand
through my joy and my pain
Knowing there's a greater day
There's a hope that never fails

Where your name is lifted high
and forever praises rise
For the glory of your name
I'm believing for the day

Where the wars and violence cease
All creation lives in peace
Let the songs of heaven rise to you alone

[chorus]

For eternity all my heart will give
All the glory to your name[x3]

[chorus]"
