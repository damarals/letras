"1" "Never Be The Same
Red

I know you, who are you now?
Look into my eyes if you can't remember
Do you remember? Oh

I can say, I can still find
Your are the only voice my heart can recognize
But I can hear you now, yeah

I'll never be the same
I'm caught inside the memories
The promises, our yesterdays
And I belong to you
I just can't walk away
Cause after loving you
I can never be the same

And how can I pretend to never know you
Like it was all a dream? No

I know i'll never forget
The way I always felt with you beside me
And how you loved me then, yeah

I'll never be the same
I'm caught inside the memories
The promises, our yesterdays
And I belong to you
I just can't walk away
Cause after loving you
I can never be the same

You left me here
Then I watched you disappear
You left this emptiness inside
And I cant turn back time

No, stay!
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares to you
I cant let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let go

I'll never be the same
Not after loving you
Not after loving you, oh

I'll never be the same
I'm caught inside the memories
The promises, our yesterdays
And I belong to you
I just can't walk away
Cause after loving you
I can never be the same

I can never be the same
I would never be the same

Oh, oh, oh

I just can't walk away
I can't walk away

From you"
