"1" "Walk On The Wild Side
Take 6

Sinner hear what I'm sayin'
Sinner you been swingin' not prayin'
One day of prayin' and six nights of fun
The odds of goin' to heaven are six to one

You walk on the wild side
The devil is waitin'
He's waitin' to take your hand
You walk on the wild side
You're walkin' with satan
Away from the promised land

One day of prayin' and six nights of fun
The odds of goin' to heaven are six to one

You better cross over
You better walk humble

Or you're gonna stumble
And satan is waitin' to take your hand

You walk on the wild side
You walk on the wild side
Away from the promised land

One day of prayin' and six nights of fun
The odds of goin' to heaven are six to one
The odds of goin' to heaven are six to one"
