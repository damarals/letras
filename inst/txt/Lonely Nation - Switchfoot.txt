Switchfoot

She turns like the ocean
She tells no emotion
She's been coming down the fine

She's just reminicing
Blood, sweat, and one thing's missing
She's been breaking up inside, inside

Singing without tongues
Screaming without lungs
I want more than a lonely nation
I want more than a lonely nation
Desperate we are young
Seperate we are one
I want more than my desperation
I Want more than my lonely nation

We are the target market
We set the corporate target
We are slaves of what we want
We're just numb and amused
And we're just to sit back losing
We are slaves of what we want

Singing without tongues
Screaming without lungs
I want more than a lonely nation
I want more than a lonely nation
Desperate we are young
Seperate we are one
I want more than my desperation
I Want more than my lonely nation

Lonely, lonely

Don't leave me home
I'm tired
Don't leave me home
I'm tired of feeling low
Feeling low
I'm tired of feeling low
Feeling low
I'm tired of feeling low
Feeling low
I'm tired of feeling low
Feeling low
Feeling low
Feeling low

Singing without tunes
Screaming without lungs
One more than my desperation
And one more than my lonely nation
Desperate we are yearn
Separate we are one
One more than my lonely nation
And one more than my lonely nation
One more than my lonely nation
And one more than my lonely nation"
