"x"
"1" "Something Beautiful
Newsboys

I wanna start it over
I wanna start again
I wanna a new beginning
One without an end
I feel it inside
Calling out to me

IT'S A VOICE THAT WHISPERS MY NAME
IT'S A KISS WITHOUT ANY SHAME
SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL
LIKE A SONG THAT STIRS IN MY HEAD
SINGING LOVE WILL TAKE US WHERE
SOMETHING'S BEAUTIFUL

I've heard it in the silence
Seen it on a face
I've felt it in a long hour
Like a sweet embrace
I know this is true
It's calling out to me

[Repeat Chorus]

IT'S THE CHILD ON HER WEDDING DAY
IT'S THE DADDY THAT GIVES HER AWAYâ€”FATHER
SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL
WHEN WE LAUGH SO HARD WE CRY
OH THE LOVE BETWEEN YOU AND I
SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL"
