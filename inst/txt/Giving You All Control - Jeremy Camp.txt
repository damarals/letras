"x"
"1" "Giving You All Control
Jeremy Camp

I felt like I was spinning didn't know what was up from down
Tried to fix what I had broken, it was scattered all around
It's seems that every time I try walking by myself
I end up on my face with no where else to go
So I surrender all my ways

Take all of these impurities
Giving You this wretched soul
I'm giving You these insecurities
Giving You all control

I've placed with my feet on the floor
Making sure I won't make that mistake anymore
I've tasted all the emptiness around me I'm never going back
I've set myself up for the lies that this world satisfes
But You're all that I need and I have peace inside
So please keep tearing out all my pride

Take all of these impurities
Giving You this wretched soul
I'm giving You these insecurities
Giving You all control

I'm taking all of these and lay them at your feet now
I'm resting in the fact that everything is safe now
I let go of all the things I know are fake now
Every word that You have ever said, I know I'll never doubt

Take all of these impurities
Giving You this wretched soul
I'm giving You these insecurities
Giving You all control"
