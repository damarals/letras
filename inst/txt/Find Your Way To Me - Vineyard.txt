"1" "Find Your Way To Me
Vineyard

You are the light of the world
You are the fire that burns out my cold
You are the hope of my weary soul

Light of Heaven
Find Your way to me

You are the grace that I need
Come now and still me
With Your sweetest kiss

I've never felt arms warm like this

Grace of Heaven
Find Your way to me"
