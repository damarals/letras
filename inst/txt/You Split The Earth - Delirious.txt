"1" "You Split The Earth
Delirious

You split the earth with rivers
You split my heart in two
You let the eagle rise with the angel
You are the air I breathe

And I love to be found in you
And I love to be found in you

You raised the mountain with a whisper
You whisper truth to me
You filled the ocean with tears for the broken
You came and filled me too

And I love to be friends with You
And I love to be friends with You

Whenever You call I will be there for You
Whatever You say I will do anything
You came as a thief you've stolen my fear
You captured my heart again
You asked me to run so I'll run with You
I will do anything You want me to

You scorched the earth with fire in your eyes
One look has burned my soul
You let the fields dance with the wind
Will You dance with me
And I long to be one with You
And I long to be one with You"
