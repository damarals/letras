"1" "Our Love Is Loud
Chris Tomlin

When we sing
Hear our songs to you
When we dance
Feel us move to you
When we laugh
Fill our smiles with you
When we lift our voices louder still
Can you hear us?
Can you feel?

We love you, Lord
We love you
We love you
We love you, Lord
We love you
We love you

When we sing loud
Hear our songs to you
When we dance 'round
Feel us move to you
When we laugh aloud
Fill our smiles with you
When we lift our voices louder still
Can you hear us?
Can you feel?

And our love is big
Our love is loud
Fill this place
(Fill our laughs)
With this love now
(To sing it now)

We lift our voices louder still
Our God is near, Our God is here"
