Vineyard

Gathered here together
In Jesus name
We have a gospel to proclaim
Sin and death are conquered
Jesus reigns
Now everybody can be saved

Amen Hallelujah
We sing: Give thanks to the Lord

Amen Hallelujah

The Lord is good
And His love will last forever
The Lord is good
And His love will last forever"
