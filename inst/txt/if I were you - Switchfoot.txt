"1" "if I were you
Switchfoot

One, two, one, two, three, four

2020 enemies
What a dismal odyssey
Held by only apathy
Is there any remedy?
'Cause we bicker over Listerine
With Twitter as our liturgy
What a crummy legacy
2020 enemies

If I were you
And you were me
Would we still be doomed
To disagree?
'Cause you'd be me
If I were you
And you'd never see
My point of view
If I were you
If I were you, mm-mm

Hey Romeo, it's Juliet
Are you Montague or Capulet?
Or some denigrating apathetic insult that we both forget?
'Cause fake is on the internet
And fear is on the TV set
Outrage is the habitat
For 2020 novelettes

If I were you (If I were you)
And you were me (And you were me)
Would we still be doomed (Would we still be doomed)
To disagree? (To disagree?)
'Cause you'd be me ('Cause you'd be me)
If I were you (If I were you)
And you'd never see (And you'd never see)
My point of view (My point of view)
If I were you

[Bridge]
Hey babe, we're the dinosaurs (Oh-oh)
I get the feeling we've been here before (Oh-oh-oh)
Ain't it clear what we're aiming for? (Oh-oh)
Hey babe, we're the dinosaurs
Yeah, but what if me and you
Were in each other shoes
Could we break through?
To somewhere different, somewhere new
'Cause if you're stuck with me
I guess I'm stuck with you
Could we rise above the scars that we both put each other through

If I were you (I think I'm ready to try us)
And you were me (I think I'm ready to try)
Would we still be doomed (To put the past behind us)
To disagree? (Yeah, to put the past behind)
'Cause you'd be me ('Cause it's already behind us)
If I were you (Yeah, I'm sick of falling behind)
And all I see (I think I'm ready to try us)
Is what you put me through (Maybe I'd be ready to try)

If I were you and you were me, I would be you
And then we'd both be true
I wonder what we'd do
If you were me, I would be you
Would one plus one be two?
I wonder what we'd do
If I were you"
