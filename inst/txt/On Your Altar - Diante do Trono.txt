"1" "On Your Altar
Diante do Trono

I cannot live for myself anymore
Help me, oh Lord
Show me your ways
Teach me your thoughts
Your will is better than mine
I surrender my dreams on your altar
My desires I surrender

The place of dying
The place where I lay down my life
As a living sacrifice
A place of renouncing
A place where I leave my heart
Lord is for you that I live and I die
A living sacrifice"
