"1" "Breathe Of Heaven
Kutless

I have traveled
Many moonless nights
Cold and weary
With a babe inside
And I wonder
What I've done
Holy father
You have come
Chosen me now
To carry your son

I am waiting
In a silent prayer
I am frightened
By the load I bear
In a world as cold as stone
Must I walk this path alone
Be with me now
Be with me now

(chorus)
Breath of heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven

Breath of heaven
Light in my darkness
Pour over me your holiness
For your holy breath of heaven

Do you wonder
As you watch my face
If a wiser one
Should have had my place
But I offer all I am
For the mercy of your plan
Help me be strong
Help me be
Help me

(chorus)"
