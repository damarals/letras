Switchfoot

Another day
Another sunrise
Another factory call
Another night
Another sunset
Another freefall

Am I alive?
Am I on purpose?
Within the weakness
Within the weakness

Spinning out in circles
In circles, in circles
Spinning out in circles
In circles, in circles

Another day
Another lifetime
Another engine stalls
Another line
Another freeway
Another freefall

Am I alive?
Am I on purpose?
Within the weakness
Within the weakness

Spinning out in circles
In circles, in circles
Spinning out in circles
In circles, in circles
In circles, in circles

I've lost all that I wanted to leave
I've lost all that I wanted to be
Don't that there's nothing this true
Don't believe in this modern machine
The modern machine

Circles

Spinning, Spinning
In circles, in circles
Spinning out in circles
In circles, in circles"
