"1" "Intro - America The Beautiful
Kirk Franklin

Oh beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain,
(You are listening to a group of children from Africa.)
For purple mountains majesties above the fruited plain,
(Their parents have died from war, famine, and AIDS)
America, America God shed His grace on thee
(I ask all of you who take life and freedom for granted)
And crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea
(Please don't forget to pray for Africa.)"
