"1" "Watch You Crawl
Red

You put my back against the wall
Watching, waiting
You never thought I'd get this far
Beneath your skin

I watched you swim with all your lies
They pulled you under
And as you wait for my demise
I'm just getting stronger

I'm learning who you really are
And nothing can save you

I will fight until the end
Get ready to collide
And I will watch you fall again
I'll bury you alive
You tried to bring me to my knees
You tried to take it all
Now I will stand and watch you crawl

I'll put you back where you belong
Hopeless, fading
And I will rise while you
Become the monster you have fed

Let you drown in your despair
Now nothing can save you

I will fight until the end
Get ready to collide
And I will watch you fall again
I'll bury you alive
You tried to bring me to my knees
You tried to take it all
Now I will stand and watch you crawl

Now I'm gonna watch you crawl!

I will fight until the end
Get ready to collide
And I will watch you fall again
I'll bury you alive
You tried to bring me to my knees
You tried to take it all
Now I will stand and watch you crawl"
