Kutless

Show me Your ways
Teach me your truths
All my hope in you

Almighty God
God of salvation
For you I? ll wait
All my days

Unto You O Lord
I lift up my soul
With all my heart I will worship you

Unto You O Lord
I lift up my soul
Holy God I will worship You

Remember Lord
Your tender mercy
Remember your love for me

You took my cross
Carried my shame
Now all my sin is swept away

My eyes are lifted up
By Your perfect love
You take away my every fear

My eyes are lifted up
You are worthy of my trust
And for You I? ll wait all my days"
