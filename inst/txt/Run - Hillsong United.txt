Hillsong United

You were God from the outset
Powerful and creative
You had sought us here
Before You called all the stars
And the earth to existence
You are God,You are Holy, History's Your story
You who was and is and You forever will be
God we live for your glory

We will run altogether our hearts aflame
With fire that can't be tamed
Our God, all glory to Your name,Jesus!

You are God, You are Freedom
You're alive now within us
You who sought us here before
You conquered the Grave
And we're living on your Promise

We will run altogether our hearts aflame
With fire that can't be tamed
Our God: all glory to Your name!
We will run! All surrendered to bring You fame!
Our desire that you be praised!
Our God:all glory To Your Name,Jesus!

Oh Lord, So great is your name
You're Worthy of all our praise

We will run altogether our hearts aflame
With fire that can't be tamed
Our God: all glory to Your name!
We will run! All surrendered to bring You fame!
Our desire that you be praised!
Our God:all glory To Your Name,Jesus!"
