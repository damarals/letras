Oficina G3

I changed the view
From below so your eyes can see
I tried to speak
But the words, you could not hear

Through my only son
I touched the world to change your life within
I'm at the door, go on, let me in

I believe in you
Hear my voice
I am here right now
My love is unconditional

I want the sun to shine again, start of a new day
Let my light shine, my ways be your ways this time
I'll always be here for you, waiting for you
I will not let go, cause I want to show your heart is mine!

How long will it take?
The cross, the proof I gave
I paid the price for you
Receive me, amazing love you take"
