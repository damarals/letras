"1" "To You
Hillsong United

Here I stand forever in Your mighty hand
Living with Your promise
Written on my heart

I am Yours
Surrendered wholly to You
You set me in Your family
Calling me Your own

Now I, I belong to You
Lord I need Your Spirit
Your word, Your truth
Hear my cry my deep desire
To Know You more

In Your name I will lift my hands to the King
This anthem of praise I bring
Heaven knows
I long to love You
With all I am
I belong to You"
