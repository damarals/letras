Vineyard

Lord, a cry, in our heart
For You to, renew us
For Your life, Your Spirit
To fill us up oh God

Here we are, Lord
Come and use us
We are Your generation
Come Lord and burn within us
Your love for man

You're never forgotten, oh
We are marching in this land
Freedom we cry, oh
To the heart of every man
You have a purpose, yeah
That is why we live today
To see Your glory
To see Your glory"
