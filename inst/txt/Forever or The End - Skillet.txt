"1" "Forever or The End
Skillet

Tell me what you're thinking
So I don't have to pretend
'Cause your mind's a million miles away
I'm a song that goes on
Way beyond the ozone
You treat me like a stranger at the gates
Why you gotta make it so hard?
Why you gotta push me so far?
Just another weekend
Where we are barely speaking
Hoping that the silence keeps us safe

How did I get here?
Was it something I said?
When you said forever
Is this what you meant?
Is it wrong that I miss you?
'Cause you never left
But the burden feels heavy
And I'm just so stumped
Is this forever or is this the end?

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

It's better to be known here
Than to be alone here
Who will be the first to make a move?
You got me on the defense
'Cause just beyond my pretense
I'm afraid I'm disappointing you
I've still got some hope in my heart
But I don't even know where to start

How did I get here?
Was it something I said?
When you said forever
Is this what you meant?
Is it wrong that I miss you?
'Cause you never left
But the burden feels heavy
And I'm just so stumped
Is this forever or is this the end?

It's never over (It's never over)
It's never over (It's never over)
It's not too late to start it all again
It's never over (It's never over)
Let's start it over (Let's start it over)
It's not too late to start it all again

How did I get here?
Was it something I said?
When you said forever
Is this what you meant?
Is it wrong that I miss you?
'Cause you never left
But the burden feels heavy
And I'm just so stumped
How did I get here?
Was it something I said?
When you said forever
Is this what you meant?
Is it wrong that I miss you?
'Cause you never left
But the burden feels heavy
And I'm just so stumped (And I'm just so stumped)
Is this forever or is this the end?

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh"
