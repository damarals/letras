"1" "Ever So Gently
Vineyard

Ever so gently
Your Spirit calls to all who hear
Ever so gently
The sound of Your voice quiet yet clear

Day and night to the ends of the earth
The skies pour forth speech
There's no place Your voice isn't heard
Your patience astounds me

(BRIDGE)
Your voice is the sweetest of sounds
It's the purest of life-giving rain
Your voice is the calm in the storm
It's the whisper of love that remains

Ever so gently
I hear Your voice pulling me near
Ever so gently
Your word of life stronger than fear

If I turn away from Your heart
Try to hide in my shame
You speak truth in love's patient way
Your gentleness breaks me"
