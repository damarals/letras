"1" "Love Like This
Lauren Daigle

When I am a wasteland
You are the water
When I am the winter
You are the fire that burns

When I am a long night
You are the sunrise
When I am a desert
You are the river that turns
To find me

What have I done
To deserve love like this?
What have I done
To deserve love like this?

Your voice like a whisper
Breaking the silence
You say there's a treasure
You'll look 'til You find it
You search to find me

What have I done
To deserve love like this?
What have I done
To deserve love like this?
I cannot earn what You so freely give
What have I done
To deserve love like this?"
