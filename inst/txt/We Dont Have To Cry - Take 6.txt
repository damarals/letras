"1" "We Don't Have To Cry
Take 6

Seems there's a lot of work for me to do
To get my life straight
Closer to You
I've wasted a lot of Your time playin'
Just hope that I'm not too late for some savin'

Channel:
He's coming back
Like a thief in the night
People get ready
We've got to live right

Chorus:
I won't rest
Until I reach the other side
I can't wait
To see His face
Get my wings and fly
We don't have to cry

Doesn't really matter what my friends say
I'm gonna do right
I'm gonna do it anyway
If I follow I can win
Don't wanna be outside lookin' in

Chorus
Channel

We don't have to cry
Cry no more"
