Fireflight

I hear the tone in your voice
you see that look in my eyes
I think youre missing the point
You think Ive lost my mind

I dont care who started this,
I dont care who started this

Drop the attitude
You dont have to win
Its not me against you
We can start again
Drop the attitude
We dont have to fight
We can make it through
Love can make it right

I think that we should just stop
I think that we need to re-wind
Forgive and live like we forgot
we ever drew this line

I dont care who started this,
I dont care who started this

I love you
I just do not understand
why we do
what we do"
