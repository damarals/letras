"1" "Through Your Eyes
Britt Nicole

Get it together!
That's what I say to me
I put on the pressure
You could do better!
Be who you're supposed to be!
But that's when You came in
Right when I needed You
Said all of the things that I was believing
Not one of them were true

You lifted my head up
I was keeping my head down
I didn't know love
But I do now

'Cause You stood right there
And then You broke apart the lies
You told me I had something beautiful inside
You brought to life the part of me I thought had died
'Cause You stood right there until I saw me
I saw me through Your eyes (Saw me)
I saw me through Your eyes (Saw me)
I saw me through Your eyes

So this is living
This is free
Not keeping score, not anymore
Not since You rescued me

You lifted my head up
I was keeping my head down
I didn't know love
But I do now

'Cause You stood right there
And then You broke apart the lies
You told me I had something beautiful inside
You brought to life the part of me I thought had died
'Cause You stood right there until I saw me
I saw me through Your eyes (Saw me)
I saw me through Your eyes (Saw me)

You love me even when I fall apart
I can't explain it, that's just who You are
Don't want perfection, You just want my heart

'Cause You stood right there (You stood right there!)
And then You broke apart the lies (Yeah!)
You told me I had something beautiful inside
You brought to life the part of me I thought had died
'Cause You stood right there until I saw me
I saw me through Your eyes
I saw me through Your eyes
I saw me through Your eyes

I saw me through Your eyes"
