"1" "Yours Again
Red

I can almost feel you breathing
Like a whisper in my ear
I remember how you lost me
Or how I lost you
I'm staring into the blackness
It's staring back at me
Why did I try to live without you?
I want you, I need you!

Open up my eyes, I need your light again
Burning me inside, I need you love again
I can feel our hearts collide
I can feel our hearts ignite
Open up my eyes, I'm yours again!

Will I wake up from this moment?
Will I see you slip away?
Or is this some new beginning
Of beauty and rage?
Where did I lose my passion?
Where did I start to fade?
Without you my world is darkness
I won't let go again!

Open up my eyes, I need your light again
Burning me inside, I need you love again
I can feel our hearts collide
I can feel our hearts ignite
Open up my eyes, I'm yours again!
I'm yours again!

I'm never letting go
I'm yours again!
Open up my eyes, I need your light again
Burning me inside, I need you love again
I can feel our hearts collide
I can feel our hearts ignite
Open up my eyes, I'm yours again!"
