"1" "My Heart Goes Out
Warren Barfield

She sat a table away
Staring into space
In her own little world
And I saw a tear in her eye
Like a window to the mind
Of a frightened little girl
She never said a word
But I know I clearly heard
A cry for help
And I wanted to answer her
I wanted to tell her

[CHORUS]:
My Heart
Goes out to you
You don’t even know me
You don’t even know
Oh my heart goes out to you
And I don’t know what else to do
To reach you now
My heart goes out
But I’m still glued to my chair
She’s unaware
There’s little time
And though my intentions are good
If I’m mis-understood
The price could be high
I can’t fix whatever’s wrong
But if I fail to pass along
Someone cares
The price could be greater
This can’t wait til’ later

[Bridge]:
For God has loved the world so much
He sent His only son
From Heaven to earth
Well there’s a distance love covered
She’s just a table over
All she needs is a shoulder

[CHORUS]:
My heart goes out to you
You don’t even know me
You don’t even know
Oh, my heart goes out
Lord, help me do what I can do
To reach her, to reach her
Oh my heart goes out to you
You don’t even know me
You don’t even know
Oh, my heart goes out to you
Let me do what I can do to reach you now
My heart goes out
Yeah"
