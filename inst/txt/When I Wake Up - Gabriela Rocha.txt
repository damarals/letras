"1" "When I Wake Up
Gabriela Rocha

When I wake up
beyond the others dream a dreaming
the otherside of mistery
and I give anything the see Your face
when I wake up
no have to fear or tragedy
and every minutes on my feet
and I give anything the see Your face
when Beyond before the stars
infinite hard to fly
me approaching
to my destiny
so many time
sad your word but
you cold never hear
this time I prayer
be different
how a long to have did
but I when wake up
a voice be blaze harmony
and Your love is eternal
and I give anything
anything
and I give anything the see Your
mas perto quero estar
meu Deus de Ti
ainda que seja a dor
que me una a Ti
sempre ei de suplicar
mas perto quero estar, oh mais perto quero estar
meu Deus de Ti
and I give anything, oh oh
anything
and I give anything, the see Your
face"
