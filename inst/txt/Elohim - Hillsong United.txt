Hillsong United

I stand upon the solid rock
Of faith in christ
This steadfast hope shall not
Break apart within the trial
I am assured
His promises will never fail
As long as life remains
He is faithful

God is patient
God is kind
He does not envy
He does not boast
His ways are higher than my own
His thoughts consume the great unknown
Of this alone I am sure
My god is love

I draw my breath under his
Created windswept sky
I know my hope shall last
Long after my flesh retires
From dusk until the dawn
He calls his children home
His righteous love outlasts generations

He is almighty god elohim
Maker of the earth
He is the lord of hosts heaven's king
God of endless worth
His kingdom stands above every power
Every living soul
His love is like the sun ever true
Shining over all"
