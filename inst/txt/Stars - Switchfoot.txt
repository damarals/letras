Switchfoot

Maybe I’ve been the problem
Maybe I’m the one to blame
But even when I turn it off and blame myself
The outcome feels the same
I’ve been thinking maybe I’ve been partly cloudy
Maybe I’m the chance of rain
And maybe I’m overcast
And maybe all my luck’s washed down the drain

I’ve been thinking about everyone,
Everyone,
You look so lonely
But when I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
When I look at the stars,
I see someone else
When I look at the stars
The stars,
I feel like myself

Stars looking at a planet
Watching entropy and pain
And maybe to start to wonder
How the chaos in our lives could
Pass as sane
I’ve been thinking about the meaning of resistance
Of a road beyond my own
And suddenly the infinite and penitent
Begin to look like home

I’ve been thinking about everyone
Everyone,
You look so empty
But when I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
When I look at the stars,
I see someone else
When I look at the stars
The stars,
I feel like myself.
Yeah!

The stars
Stars

Everyone, Everyone feels so lonely
Everyone, yeah everyone feels so empty
When I look at the stars
When I look at the stars
When I look at the stars,
I feel like myself
When I look at the stars
The stars,
I see someone"
