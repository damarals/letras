Skillet

Good evening, my people up in the chandeliers
The wining and dining, the menu is blood, sweat and tears

Everybody ready
Raining down confetti
Champions are born right now
Ain't about the glamour
Click goes the hammer
Run when you hear that sound

Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line
We know we survive
Even if we crawl to the finish line
I will believe it
Underdog dreaming
Don't need no cheers
World's gonna see it
Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line

Their dreams just keep dripping out of their golden cups
I'm starting, I'm starving, leftovers ain't enough

Ain't about the royals
They do nothing for you
All you got is you right now
Who is gonna falter
Who is gonna conquer
Better never count me out

Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line
We know we survive
Even if we crawl to the finish line
I will believe it
Underdog dreaming
Don't need no cheers
World's gonna see it
Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line

Gonna make, gonna make
Gonna make it to the finish line
Every day, every day
Gonna make it to the finish line

Gonna make, gonna make
Gonna make it to the finish line
Every day, every day
Gonna make it to the finish line

Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line
We know we survive
Even if we crawl to the finish line
I will believe it
Underdog dreaming
Don't need no cheers
World's gonna see it
Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line"
