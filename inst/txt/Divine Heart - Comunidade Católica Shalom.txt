Comunidade Cat√≥lica Shalom

Oh, Divine Heart
Unending fountain of piece
We have been washed in Your blood and water
We are recreated in You

Oh, Divine Heart
Oh, burning brazier of love
Oh, flame that burns
Heals, and purifies
We are changed into You

We adore Your Body and Blood
We trust in Your great love
And, forever our lives will be, Lord
Hidden within Your wounded heart
We adore Your Body and Blood
We trust in Your great love
Sacrifice, everlasting union
New life will spring forth
From the altar of the Cross

Oh, Divine Heart
Humanity of God
Heaven in Earth, touching our lives
We are reached by You

Oh, Divine Heart
God emptied Himself for us
Clothing men with His majesty
We are lifted up by You

We adore Your Body and Blood
We trust in Your great love
And, forever our lives will be, Lord
Hidden within Your wounded heart
We adore Your Body and Blood
We trust in Your great love
Sacrifice, everlasting union
New life will spring forth
From the altar of the Cross"
