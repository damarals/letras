Kiss Your Feet

All I have in this world
Is more than a king could ever wish for
All these crowns leave me cold
For I was born to kiss Your feet

All I have in this life
Is all for a king, you know I live for
And Your crown bears my name
For I was born to give You praise

Isn't He beautiful
Isn't He beautiful
Isn't He beautiful

Take this life, take it all
I'm breathing the dirt, but I have clean hands
So I'll run with my boots on
For I was born to give you fame

Isn't He beautiful
Isn't He beautiful
Isn't He beautiful

Yes, You are beautiful
Yes, You are beautiful
Isn't He beautiful

Yes, You are beautiful
Yes, You are beautiful
Yes, You are beautiful
Isn't He beautiful.
