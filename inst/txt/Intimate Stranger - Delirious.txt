"1" "Intimate Stranger
Delirious

I lift my eyes to you
Eyes that have seen a thing or two
Who is this stranger in my life?
I lift my hands to you
Hands that have carried what is true
Intimate stranger be my life

Jesus I love you
Jesus I adore you
Jesus you still have my affection
And my song will be \"I love you\"

I lift my voice to you
Lips that have cried a prayer or two
Beautiful stranger fill my life
I lift up my heart in praise to
The Saviour who's death made all things new

Intimate stranger only you"
