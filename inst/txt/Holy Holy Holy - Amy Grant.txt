Amy Grant

Holy, holy, holy lord god almighty
Early in the morning my song
Shall rise to thee
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty
God in three person blessed trinity

Holy, holy, holy, thou the
Darkness hide thee
Tho' the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see
Only thou art holy
There is none beside the
Perfect in power in love and purity"
