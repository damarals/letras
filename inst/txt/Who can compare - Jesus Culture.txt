Jesus Culture

Who can compare to You, my King
Who can compare to You, my Lord
Who can compare to You, my Friend
I looked and I've found that there's no one
Like You in all the earth

And You take my hand, and You call me Your own
You show me the way to life
And You lift my head, and You give me hope
You show me the way to life

No one compares to You, my King
No one compare to You, my Lord
No one compare to You, my Friend
I looked and I've found that
You're the one I needed all along

You are the way
You are the truth
You are the life
You are the way
You are the truth
You are the life"
