"1" "A Higher Standard
For Today

This is a call out to all who are left
All brothers and sisters who take the title:
You choose for yourself,
And if you claim the name, so be it.

But get your head in the game.
Let's live it.
For if we call on God, it's clear.[2x]

He has made it simple.[2x]

His eternal power and divine nature is clearly seen,
So we are without excuse.
We are held to a higher standard

But we chose it for ourselves
So, lets start a legacy.
Let's start a legacy
Right here, right now
With no excuses this time.
It's you, me, and Him
From here we shall go,
It's time to represent proudly.
But let me remind you again
We are called to a higher standard.

It can't be looked past.
The responsibility is great
but the rewards, they are so golden.
And our God is good.
His grace will carry us through.
