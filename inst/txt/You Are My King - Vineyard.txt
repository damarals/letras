"1" "You Are My King
Vineyard

I love you, love you, Jesus
Yes I love you, love you
Jesus my King

You are my King (You are my King)
And I love You
You are my King, (You are my King)

And I worship You
Kneeling before you now
All of my life, I gladly give to you

Placing my hopes and dreams
In your hands
I give my heart to you"
