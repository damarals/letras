"1" "A Million Suns
Hillsong United

You stand eternal
The uncreated one
Who knows no end

The starry wonders
The vast expanses
Bound to your command

You shine like a million suns ablaze
Wrapped in eternal light and praise
Jesus the first the last
The bright and morning star

You spoke creation
Into existence
Life and all we are

Beyond all measure
The universe
An echo of your power

Everlasting
Never ending
You will reign forevermore
You are holy
You are worthy
Lord of all"
