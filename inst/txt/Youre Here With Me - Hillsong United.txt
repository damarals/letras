"1" "You're Here With Me
Hillsong United

You're all I want, You're all I need, oh Jesus
Take more of me
So I can be more like You Jesus
And I'll hold onto You
Whatever I'll go through
You're here with me
My saviour, my King
Me everything, Oh Jesus You are
The reason I live, forever I'll give
My all to you
open my eyes so I can see who You really are
Open my ears so I can hear Your tender voice
And I'll trust in You, whatever I'll go through

You guide my path, each step that take
You lead me Lord, in Your arms I'll stay."
