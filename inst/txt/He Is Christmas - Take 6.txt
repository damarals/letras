"x"
"1" "He Is Christmas
Take 6

Well the tree's bee strung
And the melody's been sung
Christmastime has come
Have we remembere to thank the Lord?

Presents wrapped up tight
And the evergreens are white
Christmastime has come
Have we remembere to thank the Lord?

Lut us thank Him for a love so real, so perfect
(He gives His love unconditionally)
Oh what a love
Looks beyound my fauts, my burdens
Got to praise His name (forever...)

Chorus:
I can feel there's a difference on this day
Not just because It's a holiday
Sent us the Son
To all the world, Oh! He is Christmas
To all the world, Oh! He is Christmas

Left Your throne on high
All You ask is that we try
Christmastime has come
Have we remembered to thank You, Lord?

Have we thanked You for a love so real, so perfect
(He gives His love unconditionally)
Oh what a love
Looks beyound my fauts, my burdens
Got to praise His name (forever...)

Chorus"
