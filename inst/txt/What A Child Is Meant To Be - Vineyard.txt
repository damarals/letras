"1" "What A Child Is Meant To Be
Vineyard

In my weakness I find
That Your stringth knows no bounds

And in my loneliness I find
That the everlasting arms surround me

And even with this fragile heart
I find a place to rest here, safe where You are…

And I am falling into grace again
And I am running where mercy never ends

Lord I’m learning that your love can cover me
You are teaching me what a child is meant to be"
