P.O.D.

Breathe
This is the knowledge that I bring,
Universal worldwide culture
Inhale, exhale
I takes it all in
No second guessing
Truth brings forth a new passion
No second guessing
Push aside this fate for the ransom
Stands among, gold seven and lox'd up
White wool; fire eyes, glowing in red
Water of rush, planet hold, in double edge
Falling down dead, last first, it's one life
Life source, in resurrection, these bloodstains
Shining face, this morning stars reflections
Embracing light, the clearness of sunrise
Tower strong, in this refuge, my fortress

Breathe
This is the knowledge that I bring,
Universal worldwide culture
Inhale, exhale

I takes it all in
No second guessing
Truth brings forth a new passion
No second guessing
Push aside this fate for the ransom
