"1" "If You Could Hie to Kolob
Hinos Sud

If you could hie to Kolob
In the twinkling of an eye
And then continue onward
With that same speed to fly
Do you think that you could ever
Through all eternity
Find out the generation
Where Gods began to be?


Or see the grand beginning
Where space did not extend?
Or view the last creation
Where Gods and matter end?
Methinks the Spirit whispers
\"No man has found 'pure space, '
Nor seen the outside curtains
Where nothing has a place"
