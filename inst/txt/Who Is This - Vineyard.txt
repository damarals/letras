Vineyard

Who is this that appears like the dawn
Fairer than the moon brighter than the sun
You're the lover of my soul
Draw me into you, draw me into you

Who is this that beckons me to come close
Beauty beyond words surrounds me
when you're near
You're the lover of my soul
Draw me into you, draw me into you

We will run, we will fly, we will
be together
We will laugh, we will cry, we will
be together
Who is this that wipes the tears
from my eyes
Just one glimpse of you steals
my heart away
You're the lover of my soul
Draw me into you, draw me into you

Draw me into you
Draw me into you
Draw me into you
Draw me into you"
