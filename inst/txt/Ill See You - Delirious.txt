"1" "I'll See You
Delirious

I’ll see you when I get there,
Shining like the sun.
I’ll see you when I get there,
Into your arms I’ll run.

I see you when the wind blows,
Running without fear,
Born to rest in your fathers arms,
Your joy has dried the tears.

I’ll see you when I get there,
When my life’s complete,
Will you take me to Jesus’ feet?
Hand in hand we’ll sing.

We’re gonna sing for you."
