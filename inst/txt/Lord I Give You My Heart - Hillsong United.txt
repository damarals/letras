Hillsong United

This is my desire, to honour You
Lord with all my heart I worship You
All I have within me, I give You praise
All that I adore is in You

Chorus:

Lord I give You my heart
I give You my soul
I live for You alone
Every breath that I take
Every moment I'm awake
Lord have Your way in me"
