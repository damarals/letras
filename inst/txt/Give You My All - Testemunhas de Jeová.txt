"1" "Give You My All
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

So many choices that I could make
So many pathways that I could take
I know that someday I'll make my vow
How will I know if the time is now?

I've seen the blessing that come to those who take their stand for You
This isn't something somebody chose for me
It's something I wanna do

I wanna stand up on my two feet
I wanna answer the call
I wanna have Your help when I am weak
I wanna give You my all
I wanna give You my all

I wanna know You and be Your friend
I want a life that will never end
I know You're real, it's plain to see
No other God can there be for me

It's not a party nor just for fun
Journey has just begun
I wanna give you my best while I'm still young
To side with You and Your son

I wanna stand up on my two feet
I wanna answer the call
I wanna have Your help when I am weak
I wanna give You my all
I wanna give You my all

I wanna give You my all

I wanna give You my all"
