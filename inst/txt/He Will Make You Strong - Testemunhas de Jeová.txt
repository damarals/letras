"1" "He Will Make You Strong
Testemunhas de Jeov√°

There was a reason why God brought the truth to you
And called you from the darkness to the light
Within your heart, he saw the yearning you then had
To search for him and practice what is right
You promised him in prayer to do his will

He helped you then, and he will help you still
With Jesus' blood he bought you, to God you now belong
So he will make you firm, and he will make you strong
He'll guide you and protect you, as he has all along
Yes, he will make you firm, and he will make you strong

God gave his own beloved son in your behalf
On this account, he wants you to succeed
If he did not withhold the gift of his dear son
Then never doubt he'll give the strength you need
He won't forget the faith and love you've shown
He will not fail to care for all his own

With Jesus' blood he bought you, to God you now belong
So he will make you firm, and he will make you strong
He'll guide you and protect you, as he has all along
Yes, he will make you firm, and he will make you strong"
