"1" "The Way You Love Me
Jeremy Camp

Beautiful
The servant and creator
The Son of Man
Born to die for strangers

We learn to love one another
Through the love of the Father
Who gave a righteous King

So I will lift
The broken ones
Show the world
How You love me
How You love me

I will reach
I will touch
Give myself
The way You love me
The way You love me

You purified
The hidden parts of my heart
With open arms
Your healing touch is not far

I've been humbled by forgiveness
All Your grace for me is endless
And I want everyone to see

So I will lift
The broken ones
Show the world
How You love me
How You love me

I will reach
I will touch
Give myself
The way You love me
The way You love me

Because of all the love You've shown
I will give my life away, give my life away
Because of all the love You've shown
I will give my life away, give it all away

So I will lift
The broken ones
Show the world
How You love me
How You love me

I will reach
I will touch
Give myself
The way You love me
The way You love me

So I will lift
The broken ones
Show the world
How You love me
How You love me

I will reach
I will touch
Give myself
The way You love me
The way You love me

We learn to love one another
Through the love of the Father
The way You love me

I will reach
I will touch
Give myself
The way You love me
The way You love me"
