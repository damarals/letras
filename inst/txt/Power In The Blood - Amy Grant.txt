"1" "Power In The Blood
Amy Grant

Would you be free from the burden of sin?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Would you o'er evil a victory win?
There's wonderful power in the blood
There is power, power, wonder working power
In the blood of the lamb
There is powe, power. Wonder working power
In the precious blood of the lamb

Would you be free from your passion and pride?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Come for a cleansing to calvary's tide
There's wonderful power in the blood
Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood

Sin stains are lost in its life giving flow
There's wonderful power in the blood
Would you do service for Jesus your king?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Would you live daily his praises to sing?
There's wonderful power in the blood"
