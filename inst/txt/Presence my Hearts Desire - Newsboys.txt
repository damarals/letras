"1" "Presence (my Heart's Desire)
Newsboys

I lift up my voice
To the King, King of Glory
I hold out my hands
To the One who is worthy
I long for Your presence
I long, Lord I need Your touch

Chorus:
Come, O Lord, and fill up my life
With the light of Your presence
This is my heart’s desire
Come and let your Spirit abide
I long for your presence
This is my heart’s desire

I long to be washed in the well of your mercy
I long to be warmed by the fire of your glory
I long for your presence
I long for your healing touch

Come and let your Spirit abide
I long for your presence
This is my heart’s desire
It’s my desire
Lord, you’re my desire
I want to feel your presence (x4)

Chorus"
