"1" "Buried Beneath
Red

My eyes have adjusted to dark
And so is my heart
The weight of the world has covered me

I'm in over my head
Am I living or dead?
Can anyone hear me calling out?

I'm calling out

Finally breaking
So where are you now?
It's been such a long time
But I've tried to live without
I'm suffocating
I need you to breathe
So reach down and pull me up
Pull me up
Before I am buried beneath

I built this house on the shore
All I wanted was more
But I felt the sand start shifting

I saw the cracks in the walls
I painted over them all
I tried my best to just ignore

I can't ignore

Finally breaking
So where are you now?
It's been such a long time
But I've tried to live without
I'm suffocating
I need you to breathe
So reach down and pull me up
Pull me up
Before I am buried beneath

I thought I was climbing out
But it's dragging me down
What's hidden here with me
Thought I was alone
But it pulls me deeper now
I can't escape

Finally breaking
So where are you now?
It's been such a long time
But I've tried to live without
I'm suffocating
I need you to breathe
So reach down and pull me up
Pull me up
Before I am buried beneath"
