Youthful Praise

Lord, we lift up our hands to you
We worship and we adore your name
Creating a throne for you
In the midst of praise

We lift up our voice to you
We sing and shout praises to you, lord
Creating a sound for you
So that we maybe heard

Every miracle in your word
Is preceded by a sound
There’s always a great sound
I’m not waiting for anything else
To make a sound for me
I need a miracle
So I’ll make my own sound right now

Every miracle in your word
Is preceded by a sound
There’s always a great sound
I’m not waiting for anything else
To make a sound for me
I need a miracle,
I need a miracle,
I need a miracle,
So I’ll make my own sound right now

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Glory, glory, glory, hear me lord
Oh, oh, oh, oh..."
