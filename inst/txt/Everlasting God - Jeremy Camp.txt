"1" "Everlasting God
Jeremy Camp

Strength will rise
As we wait upon the Lord,
We will wait upon the Lord

Our God You reign forever
Our hope Our strong deliverer

You are the everlasting God
The everlasting God
You do not faint You won't grow weary
And You're the defender of the weak
You comfort those in need
You lift us up on wings like eagles
