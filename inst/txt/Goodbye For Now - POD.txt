"1" "Goodbye For Now
P.O.D.

I can still see the light
At the end of the tunnel shine
Through the dark times
Even when I lose my mind

But it feels like no one
In the world is listening
And I can't ever seem
To make the right decisions

I walk around in the same haze
I'm still caught in my same ways
I'm losing time in these strange days
But somehow I always know
The right things to say

I don't know what time it is
Or who's the one to blame for this
Do what I believe what I can't see
And how do you know
Which way the wind blows

Cause I can feel it all around
I'm lost between the sound
And just when I think
I know, there she goes

{chorus}
Goodbye for now
Goodbye for now
So long

Goodbye for now (I'm not the type to say I told you so)
Goodbye for now
So long (I think the hardest part of holding on is lettin go)

When will we sing
A new song
A new song

We're still smilin as the day goes by
And how come nobody
Ever knows the reasons why
Bury you deep so far
You can't see

If you're like me
Who wears a broken
Heart on your sleeve

Pains is troubles that
You know so well
Either time don't
It can't or you just won't tell

I'm not the type to say
I told you so
I think the hardest part
Of holding on is lettin it go

I don't know what time it is
Or who's the one to blame for this
Do what I believe what I can't see
And how do you know
Which way the wind blows

Cause I can feel it all around
I'm lost between the sound
And just when I think I know
There she goes

Goodbye for now
Goodbye for now
So long

Goodbye for now (I'm not the type to say I told you so)
Goodbye for now
So long (I think the hardest part of holdin on is lettin it go)

(repeat)
When will we sing
A new song
A new song

And you can sing until
There's no song left (song left)
And I can scream until
The world goes deaf (goes deaf)

For every other word
Left unsaid you should
Have took the time to
Read the sign and
See what it meant

In some ways everybody
Feels alone so if the
Burden is mine then
I can carry my own

If joy really comes
In the morning time
Then I'm gunna sit back
And wait until the
Next sun rise

Goodbye for now
Goodbye for now
So long

Goodbye for now (I'm not the type to say I told you so)
Goodbye for now
So long(I think the hardest part of holdin on is lettin it go)

(repeat 2x)
When will we sing
A new song
A new song"
