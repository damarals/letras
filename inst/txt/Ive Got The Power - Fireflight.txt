"1" "I've Got The Power
Fireflight

Burning bright, that's what I was born to do
Never quit, I know I won't ever lose
Straight to the top
You are watching me go
You cannot stop me
I'm about to blow

I've got the power inside
The power to fight
The power to be the light
I've got the power within

The power to win
The power to go for it
I've got the power"
