Switchfoot

Blame it on what you've been through
Blame it on what you're into
Blame it on your religions
Blame it on your Politicians

We've been blowing up--we're the issue
it's our condition
We've been blowing up--we're the issue
the detonation?
we're ammunition
we are the fuse and ammunition

I have no generation, show me my motivation
One world, one desperation, one hope and one salvation.

WeÂ¹ve been blowin up, weÂ¹re the issue
ItÂ¹s our condition
WeÂ¹ve been blowin up weÂ¹re the issue
the detonation?
WeÂ¹ve been blowin up weÂ¹re the issue
WeÂ¹re ammunition
WeÂ¹re ammunition
WeÂ¹re ammunition
We are the fuse and the ammunition

Look what a mess we've made of love
Look what a mess we've made, we've got ourselves to blame
Look what a bomb we've made of love

WeÂ¹ve been blowin up, weÂ¹re the issue
ItÂ¹s our condition
WeÂ¹ve been blowin up weÂ¹re the issue
the detonation?
WeÂ¹ve been blowin up weÂ¹re the issue

WeÂ¹re ammunition
WeÂ¹re ammunition
WeÂ¹re ammunition
We are the fuse and the ammunition
