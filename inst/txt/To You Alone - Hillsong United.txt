"1" "To You Alone
Hillsong United

Every Knee will bow
And every tongue confess
That Jesus Christ is Lord
Lord and king.

All glory to your name
All honor to your majesty
Forever, forever
All praise to you alone.

Every eye will see
And every heart will know
The beauty of the Lord
In all the earth."
