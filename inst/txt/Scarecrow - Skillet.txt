Hanging on this post
In my dirty clothes
Try to concentrate on You
But I keep forgetting

Safe enough to not let go
Scared enough to not release
Open up to drink the wind
You tear me up when you come in

Take me down, shake me out
Give me a brain, that I might know You better
Take me down, shake me out
Give me a brain, that I might know You better

Hanging in the sun
Waiting for the rain
Saw a field catch on fire
I caught myself just watching

Safe enough to not let go
Scared enough to not release
Open up to drink the wind
You tear me up when you come in

Take me down, shake me out
Give me a heart, that I might love You better
Take me down, shake me out
Give me a heart, that I might love You better

Hanging on a post
Just next to Yours
I want to curse and spit
I weep aloud at Your mercy

Take me down, shake me out
Give me a life, that I might serve You better
Take me down, shake me out
Give me a life, that I might serve You better
