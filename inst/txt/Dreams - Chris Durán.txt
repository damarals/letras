Chris Dur√°n

There is a place, to be reached
And there is a bridge
That surely will take you there
There's a dream there is a voice
Saying your dreams belongs to me

I'll guide you to a place that's true
And once you get there
You'will know that all along the way

Your dreams are mine
Your troubles mine to
And your life also belongs to me
I will take care of you
I will never forsake you
And all my promises will come true

I'll guide you to a place that's true
And once you get there
You'will know that all along the way
I was there by your side"
