Woke up this mornin'
Worries of the world all over my mind
Make plans, don't matter
Never seem to have enough time

But somethin' seems to happen when I slow down
All I need is all I have right here, right now

I've got blessings on blessings
Written all over my life
Even when things are goin' wrong
I got so much goin' right
There's a song in my soul
And there's breathe inside o' my lungs
So many things to thank You for
How could I just choose one?

I've got blessings on blessings
Oh, yeah

These trials I'm facin'
You can use all of them for my good
My heart's reshapin'
Like I never thought it could

All the little miracles along the way
How could I not give you back my grateful praise?

I've got blessings on blessings
Written all over my life
Even when things are goin' wrong
I got so much goin' right
There's a song in my soul
And there's breathe inside o' my lungs
So many things to thank You for
How could I just choose one?

I've got blessings on blessings
I've got blessings on blessings

I just want to thank You
I just want to thank You, Lord
All the ways You're faithful
I'll number the stars
I just want to thank You
I just want to thank You, Lord
Never-ending praises pour out of my heart

I've got blessings on blessings (Oh)
Written all over my life (My life)
Even when things are goin' wrong
I got so much goin' right (Sure do)
There's a song in my soul (Soul)
And there's breathe inside o' my lungs (Oh)
So many things to thank You for
How could I just choose one? (Choose one)

I've got blessings on blessings (Blessings, yeah)
I've got blessings on blessings (Blessings, yeah)
I've got blessings on blessings

I've got blessings on blessings on blessings on blessings"
