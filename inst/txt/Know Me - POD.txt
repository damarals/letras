"1" "Know Me
P.O.D.

Take 5 second, think about my crew, who am I P.O.D.

Chorus
Listen my cry, What do you hear?
Live my breath, How do you feel?
Look my soul, What do you see?
Imagine a moment, You don't know me

Take five seconds and listen up, Open your mind
Never met me face to face, but persist to talk behind my back
In face, you never even seen me never been where I am
From, where I'm at, or even be me so check me, test me,
I ain't got nothing to loose, been down since the beginning
Stop and stare at me not who you are
Cuz your to scared to be

Chorus

Reap what I've sown, it all goes along with my past
It's not the first time I've struggled and it won't be the last
No class, when you talk about another how can you say
You love me, when you hate your brother, you smother
But my faith keeps me difference between me and you holmes
Is that I'm forgiven, I got your back if you're down with my crew
I looked to him, so I don't answer to you

Chorus

Who am I, I am you
8x

I'm just like you
4x

Listen my cry and tell me, I know you hear me
Live my breath and tell me, I know you feel me
Look my soul, and tell me, I know you see me
I know you love me
