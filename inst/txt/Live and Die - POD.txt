"1" "Live and Die
P.O.D.

I get up Friday morning and I'm late for school
Only 13, but I got a mad pull, it's cool
Who needs a job when I can steal and rob
Making all that money, but my mom don't think it's funnly
Call up the Homies cuz today's the day they gonna make a man of me
A gangsta, an O.G. They say I'm young, but I got much heart
Feel like a kid inside, I know how to play the part
Gotta get jumped in, but man it ain't no thang
5 minutes of pain for the love of a gang
Might not be right, but it's all I Know
Messed up and joined a gang, gave away my soul

Chorus
Nothing matters to me, except right now
Make it through till tomorrow, some way some how
You don't understand, but it makes sense to me
I won't stop until I rest in peace
2x

I got my first 9-lim, so brothers beware looking to get into some trouble
All it takes is a stare without a care, I see some fools that ain't from my set
Represent what I claim, then take my respect scared as heck,
But I'm down with how you figure, you might be big
But my trigga is bigga, Bust five shots as I fall to the floor
Within a single second, I become Hardcore
I knew this morning, it would be one of those days G'
I missed them suckas again, but hit a lady and her baby

Chorus 2x

Get that fool
Live by the sword, Die by the sword
Innocent life, what they dying for
Live by the Gat, die by the gun
Who suffers when it's all said and done
