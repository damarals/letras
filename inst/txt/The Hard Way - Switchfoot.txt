"1" "The Hard Way
Switchfoot

Oh, my head
Lately my eyes have been bloodshot red
I'm looking for somewhere to hide
Could you tell me where I needed to go?
Oh, my head
Lately all my thoughts
are arriving dead
I drift where the sea meets the sky
Could you tell me what I needed to know, oh?

Maybe I always learn things the hard way
I learn best from my mistakes
The road I took was the wrong one
It all works in the long run
Maybe there's no such thing as a rewind
Therе's no way to go back in time
I learn best from thе replay
I always learn things the hard way

Words were said
Now even the pain wants peace instead
I bury my thoughts in the tide
Could you told me where I needed to go?
Oh, my bad
Echoes of the truths and the lies we said
The ocean, the mirror of the sky
Tell me everything I needed to know

Oh, maybe I can't keep blaming it all on luck
When I complain, then I self-destruct
Maybe it's me with the problems
Stuck looking at trying to solve them
Maybe there's no such thing as a rewind
There's no way to go back in time
I learn best from the replay
I learn things the hard way

'Cause maybe the learning comes from the mistake
There's no beauty without pain
No one said it would be easy
We can't undo the things we said
Even if I could, would you believe me?
No one said it would be easy
Maybe the song we sang was just out of time
Maybe we could give it one more try
One more try
Yeah, yeah

Oh, maybe the small violin and the tissue
Hoping to put it behind me and kiss you
Hoping to put it behind me and kiss you
Singing along to chorus of Fix You
All along it was me with the issues
Maybe there's no such thing as an easy fix
In love and war, in politics
Maybe it's time that I dealt with this
Finally love takes the hard way

(Maybe there's no such thing) As the free road
(Maybe there's no such thing) As the free road
(Maybe there's no such thing) As a rewind
(Maybe there's no such thing)
I know why you walked away
(Maybe there's no such thing) As a quick fix
(Maybe there's no such thing)
But I don't wanna live like this
(Maybe there's no such thing)
I always learn things the hard way"
