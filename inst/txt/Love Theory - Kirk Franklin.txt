Kirk Franklin

Brothers and sisters
I wanna welcome you back to life
Back to the one
That can make your next chapter
Your best chapter
Hallelujah

How can it be
That You love the most unlovable part of me
Of me
How could You see
Your life was the only gift I'll ever need
To be free

It's amazin' with You
I win even if I lose
Everything's workin' for my good for always

He saves the day
He will come through
He won't doubt, that's not what superheroes do
No greater love
Makes my heart beat
All I wanna do is make You proud of me

I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody
Love nobody but You

How can it be
Everyone of my secrets that You keep
You cover me
A mystery
Your patience with me God will never leave
Don't ever leave

Help me to see like You
No matter what I go through
Everything's workin' for my good for always

He saves the day
He will come through
He won't doubt, that's not what superheroes do
No greater love
Makes my heart beat
All I wanna do is make You proud of me

I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody
Love nobody but You

I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody
Love nobody but You

Lovin' You will be
Will be the death of me
That's how it's s'pposed to be
More of you less of me

I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody
Love nobody but You

I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody
Love nobody but You

He saves the day
He will come through
He won't doubt, that's not what superheroes do
No greater love
Makes my heart beat
All I wanna do is make You proud of me

He saves the day
He will come through
He won't doubt, that's not what superheroes do
No greater love
Makes my heart beat
All I wanna do is make You proud of me

I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody
Love nobody but You

I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody but You
I don't wanna love nobody
Love nobody but You"
