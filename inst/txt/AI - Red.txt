[Verse 1]
Burning
I step into the sun
And it stings me
But traces of your love
What have I become?

[Chorus]
Lost inside a memory
Buried deep inside of me
Never breaking
I'm escaping
Lost inside a memory
Can't erase the agony
Never breaking
Overtaking now

[Verse 2]
Learning
The meaning of life
And it haunts me
Would you run into my mind?
Left my heart so blind

[Chorus]
Lost inside a memory
Buried deep inside of me
Never breaking
I'm escaping
Lost inside a memory
Can't erase the agony
Never breaking
Overtaking"
