Hillsong United

Verse
I have this hope
As an anchor for my soul
Through every storm
I will hold to you

With endless love
All my fear is swept away
In everything
I will trust in you

Chorus
There is hope in the promise of the cross
You gave everything to save the world you love
And this hope is an anchor for my soul
Our god will stand
Unshakeable

Verse
Unchanging one
You who was and is to come
Your promise sure
You will not let go

Bridge
Your name is higher
Your name is greater
All my hope is in you

Your word unfailing
Your promise unshaken
All my hope is in you"
