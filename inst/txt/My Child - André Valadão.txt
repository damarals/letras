"1" "My Child
André Valadão

my child I am here
longing for the moment
when you're back with me
I want to hold you near
my child, come and see
I am waiting for you
whit my arms open wide
come running, come to me

cry out for me
I'll hear your call
seek me and I wiil be found
I will never let you down
draw near to me
I will take you in my arms
I'll give you new life
I will keep you by my side
you're my child

let me hold you
let me hug you
tet me squeeze you
let me caress you
how i love you"
