"1" "My Soul Finds Rest
Vineyard

My soul finds rest
In God alone
He only is my salvation
My Rock, my Peace
My fortress strong
I will ever love and adore Him

Great love of God
Jesus, His name
He only is my foundation
For on the cross
He bled and died
And He took my sorrows forever

For on the cross
He bled and died
And He took my sorrows forever
And I will praise Him, whatever"
