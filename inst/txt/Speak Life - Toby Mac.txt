Speak Life
Some days life feels perfect, other days it just ain't workin'
The good, the bad, the right, the wrong, and everything in between
It's crazy, amazing, we can't turn a heart through the words we say
Mountains crumble with every syllable, hope can live or die

So speak life
To deadest darkest night
Speak life, speak life
When the sun won't shine and you don't know why
Look into the eyes of the broken hearted
Watch them come alive as soon as you speak hope you speak love
Speak life, speak life

Some days the tongue gets twisted, other days my thoughts just fall apart
I do, I don't, I will, I won't
It's like I'm drownin' in the deep
Well it's crazy to imagine words from our lips as the arms of compassion
Mountains crumble with every syllable, hope can live or die

Lift your head a little higher
Spread the love like fire
Hope will fall like rain when you speak life with the words you say
Raise your thoughts a little higher
Use your words to inspire
Joy will fall like rain when you speak life with the things you say
Lift your head a little higher
Spread the love like fire
Hope will fall like rain when you speak life with the words you say"
