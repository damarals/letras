Selah

Verse 1:
Modern day inventions with evil intentions,
won't let this madness cease?
some point in man's creating,
he fell in love with hating,
how it has taken our peace.
But God did not give us the spirit of fear,
there's no need for alarm.
the promise He made, He starts to perform
and protect us from all harm.
Chorus 1:
No weapon, no weapon,
no weapon is going to win.
For every weapon formed against you,
God shall condemn.
No weapon, no weapon,
no weapon is going to win.
For every weapon formed against you,
God shall condemn, God shall condemn.
Verse 2:
Substance misusers, children abusers,
who will stand up and say,
that crooked politicians only worsens the condition,
sinful and immoral decay.
But God did not give us the spirit of fear
there's no need for alarm.
the promise He made, He starts to perform
and protect us from all harm.
Chorus 2:
No weapon, no weapon,
no weapon is going to win.
For every weapon formed against you,
God shall condemn.
Bridge:
We shall not fear the terror by night
nor the arrows by day,
every enemy and every foe,
the word of God, they must obey.
Chorus 2
Ending:
God shall condemn.
(repeat as desired)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
(repeat as desired)
God shall condemn.
(repeat as desired)"
