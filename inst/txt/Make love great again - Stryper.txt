"1" "Make love great again
Stryper

Make Love Great Again

I've been tryin'
To get it right
Tears I'm cryin'
Dark as night

Times are changing
So am I
Rearranging
Wrong from right

Hope is alive, It never died

(Chorus)
Make Love Great Again
Fight for it till the end
Don't let the darkness in
Make Love Great Again

There's a culture
Building walls
Just like vultures
Consuming all

But the fire
Is burning bright
It won't expire
Even in spite

Of hatred
It's flames they are sacred

(Chorus)
Make Love Great Again
Fight for it till the end
Don't let the darkness in
Make Love Great Again"
