Hillsong United

There is no god above You, There is no other like You.
Jesus, in You alone is righteousness and strength
Faithful in all Your ways, exalted above all names,
Desire of every nation, high above all gods.

You’re most Holy, most righteous
Almighty God, all faithful Lord
You’re most wonderful, most worthy to
Receive glory, power and strength

All nations shall come worship
For You alone are Holy.
Who would not fear You Lord
And glorify Your Name?
In You alone the fullness dwells
In You alone salvation for the world
There is no other god and
All the earth will sing"
