"1" "We Exalt Your Name (Feat. Matt Maher)
Kari Jobe

Spirit come and change the atmosphere
Convict and open hearts here
The anthems that the angels sing
The worship of the king of kings

For jesus reigns
Over all he reigns

We exalt your name
High above the heavens
We exalt your name
All of creation sings praise

For jesus reigns
Over all he reigns
Yeah, yeah...

Your presence fills and satisfies
Tear's down the walls we hide behind
Oh, god of every aching heart
We long for you in light and dark

For jesus reigns
Over all he reigns

We exalt your name
High above the heavens
We exalt your name
All of creation sings praise [2x]

For jesus reigns
Over all he reigns
For jesus reigns
Over all he reigns...

You reign yes,

We exalt your name
High above the heavens
We exalt your name
All of creation sings praise [2x]

For jesus reigns
Over all he reigns
For jesus reigns
Over all he reigns

We exalt your name [3x]"
