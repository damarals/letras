"1" "Give Her The Strength
Jamily

She was a girl
A young and pretty girl
Who has the wings to fly
But she could not fly
All by herself
She has no strength at all
She has no hope at all
And she's about to fall

By the time, she found you
Her dreams were dead
Her dreams were dead
By the time, she found you
Her dreams were dead
Oh God!

Give her the strength
So she can fly
Give her the strength
So she can fight
Give her the strength
So she can fly
Give her the strength
So she can fight

Give her the strength
So she can fly
Give her the strength
So she can fight
Give her the strength
So she can fly
Give her the strength
So she can fight

It's a long journey
She may stumble
But she won't crumble
Becoming strong again
And every breath
She takes
And every step ahead
And tears are wiped away
She's getting stronger

By the time, she found you
Felt alive again
Alive again
By the time, she found you
Felt alive again
Oh God!

Give her the strength
So she can fly
Give her the strength
So she can fight
Give her the strength
So she can fly
Give her the strength
So she can fight

Give her the strength
So she can fly
Give her the strength
So she can fight
Give her the strength
So she can fly
Give her the strength
So she can fly"
