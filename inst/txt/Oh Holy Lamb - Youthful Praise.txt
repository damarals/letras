"1" "Oh Holy Lamb
Youthful Praise

Oh Holy Lamb, the Great I am
Gave His life for me, back on calvary
He who knew no sin, died for sinful men
Jesus Christ - the Holy Lamb
Jesus Christ - the Holy Lamb

Bridge:
(Lead):
He was wounded for our transgressions
He was bruised for our iniquities
(Choir):
Surely He bore our sorrows...
(And with His stripes, we are healed)
We are healed, We've been set free
We've been made whole, Because of the Lord

(L:) He is the Holy Lamb,
And we love Him, we adore Him
(C:) He is the Holy Lamb,
And we love Him, we adore Him

Jesus Christ - the Holy Lamb!"
