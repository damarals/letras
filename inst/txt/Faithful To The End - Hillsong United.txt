"1" "Faithful To The End
Hillsong United

I'll sing of the grace that I found in You
And all that You?ve done through
The power of the cross for me
I?ll sing of the mercy I found in You
And all that You are and the fullness of your love for me

All that I have has come from Your hands
And all I ever know is Jesus
You are faithful to the end

I?ll tell of the wonders I found in You
And the love that You?ve shown
That?s higher than the heavens and burns in me
What in this world could take me from Your Love?"
