"1" "Keeping Me Alive
Fireflight

I don't trust you to save me
At least I never wanted to
So I dare you to love me
When I can't even love myself
'cause I don't want to feel you
Try to break through to me

Oh, I know I've done it to myself
I see that you're the only one left
Who wants to stay by my side
Your love is keeping me alive

This is brand new to let go
The fear that I've rehearsed so long
And how'd you undo, tear down
The home I've made of my disease
And now I need to feel you, hear you
Break through to me

Oh, I know I've done it to myself
I see that you're the only one left
Who wants to stay by my side
Your love is keeping me alive

Need to feel you break through to me

Oh, I know I've done it to myself
I see that you're the only one left
Who wants to stay by my side
Your love is keeping me alive
Alive
Alive"
