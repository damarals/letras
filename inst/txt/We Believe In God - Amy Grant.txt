"1" "We Believe In God
Amy Grant

We believe in God
And we all need Jesus
'Cause life is hard
And it might not get easier
But don't be afraid
To know who you are
Don't be afraid to show it
If you believe in God
If you say you need Jesus
He'll be where you are
And he never will leave you
Sing to me now words that are true
So all in this place can know it...

We believe in God
And we all need Jesus
We believe in God
And we all need Jesus
We believe in God
And we all need Jesus

Sing to me now words that are true
So all in this place can know it...

We believe in God
And we all need Jesus
We believe in God
And we all need Jesus
We believe in God
And we all need Jesus"
