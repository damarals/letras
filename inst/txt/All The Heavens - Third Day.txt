"1" "All The Heavens
Third Day

As your children gather in peace
All the angels sing in Heaven
In your temple all that I seek
Is to glimpse your holy presence

All the heavens cannot hold you, Lord
How much less to dwell in me?
I can only make my one desire
Holding on to Thee

All the angels exault you on high
What a kingdom to depart
But you left your throne in the sky
Just to live inside my heart

All the heavens cannot hold you, Lord
How much less to dwell in me?
I can only make my one desire
Holding on to Thee
