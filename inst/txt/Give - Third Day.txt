Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day

From the recording: Time, Track #10.

You said all that follow You may find
Comfort and pain, blessings in hard times
Were I to leave, where else would I go?
The words of life and of truth You hold

All I want is love
I confess to this
I will take it, Lord
All You have to give

how great the love lavished on us all
that we can be the children of God
"
