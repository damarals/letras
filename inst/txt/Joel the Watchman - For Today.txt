"1" "Joel (the Watchman)
For Today

Let the trumpet sound for the coming King.
The almighty approaches!
Let the whole world see.
Wake up!
This is really happening--the locusts devouring everything.
The great and dreadful day of the Lord has fallen on the land. May you bear the mark of righteousness.
We will not be forsaken.
May your conviction stand to profess:
we will not be forgotten.

America, you will be judged,
but His people will be restored.
You will be judged.
Seek your mercy now,
while it may still be found.
Arise, take up your sword and choose your side.
Tonight, prepare for battle.
For the dream of God will come from the lips of children,
and His Spirit will pour out onto all flesh.
You will see the sun black out,
and the moon turned to blood.
Then you will know there is one God and the LORD is His name.

You will be judged,
but His people will be restored.
Fall to your knees,
for there is life at the throne of God."
