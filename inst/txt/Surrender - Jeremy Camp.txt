Jeremy Camp

Purify this tainted soul
I'm tired of living life a fool
Soften up this hardened clay
To be a servant this I pray
A reflection of You I long to be
So Your kingdom I will seek

I surrender to Your throne
I surrender to Your throne
I will make my heart Your home
I surrender to Your throne

I've taken things I thought my own
Only to reap all that I've sown
You've given back the years I've fought
Unending love and grace You've brought
Eternal hope and peace You bring
And forever unto You I will sing

I surrender to Your throne
Oh, I surrender to Your throne
I will make my heart Your home
Oh, I surrender to Your throne

Forever unto You I will sing
Forever unto You I will sing
Forever unto You I will sing
Forever unto You I will sing

And I surrender (I surrender)
And I surrender (I surrender)
And I surrender now

And I surrender (I surrender)
And I surrender (I surrender)
And I surrender now

I surrender, I surrender, and I surrender (I surrender)
Oh, I surrender, I surrender, I surrender now

Soften up this hardened clay
To be a servant this I pray"
