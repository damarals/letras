Leonardo Gon√ßalves

Ever since my early childhood
I heard about a God
Who turned prisoners into governors
Rivers into blood
Who would choose a humble shepherd
To be a noble king
And all these other stories
That caused my heart to sing

But as soon as I grew older
I wanted to break free
I took my own decisions
And thus saw liberty
But entrapped in my transgressition
When I was frightened and alone
I could feel His holy presence
Urging me to come back home

Lord, I surrender all
I sensed Your presence, heard call
And choose to live my life for you
Please take my heart and make it new
And help me understand the power of Your healing
That sensitive Your appealing
All my life be restored

And it's those who feel rejected
Are tired and alone
It is you whose life is shattered
He wants to call His own
For He left His throne in Heaven
A perfect price to pay
And if you can feel His presence
Why not sing this song today?

Lord, I surrender all
I sensed Your presence, heard Your call
And choose to live my life for you
Please take my heart and make it new
And help me shine Your light trough happiness and
sorrow
So that today and not tomorrow
I may sing of Your love."
