"1" "Somebody's Trying To Kill Me
P.O.D.

I can see your shadow in the darkness
I can hear you whispering my name
I felt you enter in my conscience
I must confess this fear's controlling me

Somebody's trying to kill me
or is this all in my mind?
Somebody's trying to kill me
I hope I get to the light

Every time I think I'm hearing voices
I ask God, please, make it go away!
See, I've tried to find who's behind the will
So is this will or am I just paranoid?

Somebody's trying to kill me
or is this all in my mind?
Somebody's trying to kill me
I hope I get to the light

I don't want to die
I don't want to die
I don't want to die

Somebody's trying to kill me
or is this all in my mind?
Somebody's trying to kill me
I hope I get to the light"
