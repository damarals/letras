Chris Tomlin

Humbly I wait
Here in Your presence
Oh, how I need You
Quiet my soul
I long for Your whisper
Oh, how I need You

Je-e-sus, Je-e-sus

As I worship in surrender
I feel heaven drawing closer
As I lay down my defenses
Your love invades
And I brace for the impact

I am undone
Lost in Your glory
Oh, how I love You
Covered in grace
Found in Your mercy
Oh, how I love You

As I worship in surrender
I feel heaven drawing closer
As I lay down my defenses
Your love invades
And I brace for the impact
I brace for the impact
Oh-ooh-ooh

Love like a mighty river, like a rushing wind
Sweeps through me, right through me
Love like a thousand oceans, like a symphony
Sweeps through me, right through me

As I worship in surrender
I feel heaven drawing closer
As I lay down my defenses
Oh, Your love invades
And I brace for the impact

Love like a mighty river, like a rushing wind
Sweeps through me, right through me
Love like a thousand oceans, like a symphony
Sweeps through me, right through me

Right through me"
