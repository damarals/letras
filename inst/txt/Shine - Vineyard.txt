Vineyard

Answer me when I call
You are my only prayer
When darkness is all around
I know You will be there

Many are asking who can
Show us something real
Longing for hope beyond the pain
Of what they feel
So I will go down on my knees and say

Shine Your light on us
That all may see Your goodness
Shine Your face on us
That all may see Your glory

I want to be close to You
That my life would tell Your story
I want to be one with You
Changed by the light of Your glory"
