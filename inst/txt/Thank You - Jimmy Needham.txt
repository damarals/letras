"x"
"1" "Thank You
Jimmy Needham

It's time I count the ways like 1-2-3-4-5
Every breath I take is air that You provide
My life is in Your hands and
I won't take that for granted
Don't understand it but I know it's true

I wanna thank You, thank You
I wanna thank You, thank You
Every direction I see
Everything You've done for me
I don't know where I would be without You

I wanna thank You, thank You
For who You are, what You do
I'm gonna give it my best
I may just run out of breath
But You deserve nothing less, yes it's true

You got me lifting off like 5-4-3-2-1
You take the limits off of what I can become
Was crawling now I'm flying
Your love is death-defying
Can't keep quiet gotta let it out
Ain't nobody, nobody like You
I'm so grateful for everything You do"
