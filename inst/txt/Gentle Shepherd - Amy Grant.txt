Amy Grant

Gentle Shepherd,
Show us the way
Keep us safe,
On the journey
Give us shelter,
When the day is done
Lead us out,
Out of the darkness
Open our eyes,
When the morning comes
Show us the sun

CHORUS 1
Gentle Shepherd,
Show us the way
Grant us mercy,
Hope for tomorrow, and
Strength for a day
Gentle Shepherd
Show us your grace

When we fall,
Lift us up Lord
When we wander,
Bring us home again
Give us love,
For one another
Show us your power,
Help us understand
Merciful friend

CHORUS 2
Gentle Shepherd,
Show us the way
Grant us mercy,
Hope for tomorrow, and
Strength for a day
Gentle Shepherd,
Show us your grace
Show us your face

Blessed Jesus,
Show us your face"
