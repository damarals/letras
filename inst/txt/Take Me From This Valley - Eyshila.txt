"1" "Take Me From This Valley
Eyshila

Take me from this valley
You will find no resistance in me
I don't wanna stay here just like this
Always in this valley
Where the shadows are death, keep pulls in me
And the cry of my voice no one hears

Take me from this valley
As I reach for your hand
Take me from this valley
Let just spirit demand
And off of all this valley
It is time to break free
Give me wings to fly as eagles can do
Give me feet as deers' feet running to you

Take me from this valley
Oh I need to be someone that is free
This is all I have dreamed and I will
I will defeat this valley
So that light shall come back within me
And my spirit shall bound be redeemed"
