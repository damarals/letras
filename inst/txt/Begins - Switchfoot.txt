"1" "Begins
Switchfoot

To an aged man God spoke
Words that sounded like a joke
Soon his wife would bear a child
A saying hard to reconcile
So he asked, can this thing be
Can a nation spring from me
With a body grown so old
In a word this man was told

CHORUS
Your life begins with God
Your love begins with God
Your hopes and your dreams
And your plans begin with God
Your life begins with God
Your love begins with God
Your hopes and your dreams
And your plans begin with God

From a valley full of bones
To a man of God, well known
Came a vision strange but true
Mighty things the Lord would do
He would breathe them back to life
His command caused them to rise
Like the nation He would raise
To the glory of His praise

(Chorus)

I was standing on the edge of the world
Hopelessly alone in the dark
In the beginning all was empty and void
In my mind, my soul, my heart of hearts
The Creator came and moved in my life
He spoke and turned my darkness to light
Day by day He's rearranging my ways
He's my Lord, my God, my King

To a leper on his face
To a woman's dark disgrace
To a prisoner's empty night
To a blind man's quest for sight
To a mother's boy lying dead
To a beggar's plea for bread
To a lame man's crippled bones
To a stranger's journey home

(Chorus)"
