"1" "Your Holy Presence
Comunidade Cat√≥lica Shalom

I want to be in Your presence
I want to be in Your presence, oh Lord

If only I would be touched by the power of Your mercy
I would be made new
If only I would be touched by the power of Your mercy
I would be made new

It is Your holy presence
That heals all the wounds that I have made
That heals all the wounds that were opened in me, oh Lord

It is Your holy presence
That heals all the wounds that I have made
That heals all the wounds that were opened in me, oh Lord

I trust in You
I hope in You
I believe, yes I love you
Cause Your mercy for love can make all things new"
