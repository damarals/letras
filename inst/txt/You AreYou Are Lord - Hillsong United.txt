"1" "You Are/You Are Lord
Hillsong United

You are my light and salvation, whom shall fear?
You are the strength of all my days, of whom shall I be afraid?
Though war may rise against me, of this will I be sure
That I will bless the Lord forever, I'll bless Your holy Name
Yes, I'll will bless the Lord forever, I'll bless Your holy Name
Lord, it is You I desire, it's You that I seek
To live with You in Your house forever, beholding Your beauty
In the time of trouble, of this I will be sure
You ask me who do I say that You are and I say that You are the Christ, Son of living God"
