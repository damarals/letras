Amy Grant

I've known you long as anybody
You know me better than the rest
Please don't say we don't see eye to eye now
Friend to friend, can you tell me this:

Tell me, tell me, where do you belong
I guess you've no idea
Tell me, tell me, where do you come from (yeah)
Tell me, tell me, why do you pretend to know.

Listen to me now
He loves you
Listen to me now
He cares for you
Listen to me now
He wants you to come home
(Yeah) Sharayah

Chorus:
I care about you
I don't want to push you
Sharayah
I care about you
I don't want to lose you now
I don't want to lose you now
Come with me...Sharayah.

Sharayah

Call His name that is all He's asking
Let Him come down to where you are
You can have life that's everlasting
Can't you see this is just the start.

Tell me, tell me, where do you belong
I guess you've no idea
Tell me, tell me, where do you come from (yeah)
Tell me, tell me, why do you pretend to know.

Listen to me now
He loves you
Listen to me now
He cares for you
Listen to me now
He wants you to come home
(Yeah) Sharayah

(Repeat Chorus Twice)

Come with me...Sharayah
Come with me...Sharayah
Come with me...Sharayah
Come with me...Sharayah
Sharayah
Sharayah.
