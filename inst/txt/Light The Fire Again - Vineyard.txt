"1" "Light The Fire Again
Vineyard

Don't let my love grow cold
I'm calling out, Light the fire again
Don't let my vision die
I'm calling out, Light the fire again

You know my heart, my deeds
I'm calling out, Light the fire again
I need Your discipline
I'm calling out, Light the fire again

I am here to buy gold refined in the fire
Naked and poor, wretched and blind I come
Clothe me in white so I won't be ashamed
Lord Light the fire again"
