"1" "Hands Of Kindness
Delirious

Oh your hands of kindness are here for me
And I have heard they are silken and can carry me

How I love you
All I am is you
King of love I bow

Oh your hands of mercy were scarred for me
And your body was broken so that I go free

Oh your love that burns me, deeper than the sea
And the treasure I find here, the saviour's love for me"
