"1" "Holding On
Stryper

Everyone has been hurt before - love will come and go
When you put your faith in something so unsure
Never happy and wanting more - love will never grow
Till you put your faith in something that's secure

I'm holding on to the One from above
The One that's secure the one that has cured
My broken heart with perfect love

I never thought it would be this good
I never even dreamed that someone could make my
Life so complete
So if you're hurting and wanting more
No matter how it seems you can have it all
If you will just believe

That someone is there for you
To catch you when you fall
To make your life brand new
To give you all
