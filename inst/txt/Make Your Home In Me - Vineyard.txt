"1" "Make Your Home In Me
Vineyard

I have sung my songs of praise, thanksgiving on my lips
Bowed low and worshipped you
But now I'm coming close, closer than before
For the veil is torn in two

Now that I am here with You
There's no place I'd rather be
Now that I have felt Your touch
Make Your home in me

I feel so safe with You, acceptance in Your voice
You whisper tenderly
You are my beloved, chosen one, my friend
You're so precious to me"
