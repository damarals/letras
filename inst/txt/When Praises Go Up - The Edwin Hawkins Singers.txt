"1" "When Praises Go Up
The Edwin Hawkins Singers

Chorus:
When the praises go up,
blessings come down,
and I don't mind praising my Lord.

There's a blessing in store
when you praise Him the more,
so why not praise Him right now.

Bridge:
Praise Him in the morning,
we should praise Him in the noonday and eve.

Praise Him when the sun goes down;
I'm gonna give Him praises
every night, every day.

Praise Him in the morning,
we should praise Him in the noonday and eve.

Praise Him when the sun goes down;
I'm gonna give Him praises
every night, every day.

Vamp 1:
I'm gonna send up my praise,
yes, I will sing praise to the King.

Vamp 2:
I'm gonna send up, hallelujah,
I'm gonna send up, glory.
I'm gonna send up, thank You, Jesus.
I'm gonna send up, praise.

Vamp 1

Vamp 3:
Praise, praise, praise, hallelujah.
Praise, praise, praise, praise.

Vamp 1

Ending:
I'm gonna send up."
