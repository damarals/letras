"1" "Never Let Me Go
Hillsong United

In the shadows my spirit weak
Love broke through the darkness and lifted me
and I know :You'll never let me go!
In the storm and the raging seas
Love conquered the fear and delivered me
and i know :You'll never let me go...

Your Love in the shadows be the light
who leads me on
Your love I will follow be my guide
your will be done
oh Lord

In the arms of the one unseen
Love carries the cross that was meant for me
and I know You'll never let me go...

Your Love in the shadows be the light
who leads me on
Your love I will follow be my guide
your will be done
oh Lord

Your love I surrender
now forever I belong
and the love of the father
You are faithful, You are strong

Hold me now
Hold me now
Hold me now
.......................
In this life as I walk the streets
Love open my eyes show me what You see
and I know I'll never let You go!"
