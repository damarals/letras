"1" "Where You Are
Jesus Culture

How I need Your touch that gently leads me home
I know I miss so much walking on my own
Laying down my pride I will follow You

I wanna be where You are
I wanna be where You are

You alone my heart its song to know
Everything I want and need and more
I wanna be where You are
I wanna be where You are

I have seen the fire in Your eyes
In Your love I finally align
I wanna be where You are
I wanna be where You are

Even when I run and hide
I feel You come to my side
No matter what I can't escape You

Even in the depths of my sin
I feel Your presence reach in
No matter what I'm captured by You"
