"1" "Winter Wonderland
Amy Grant

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we stroll along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say \"Are you married?\", we'll say \"No, man,
But you can do the job when you're in town.\"

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland.
