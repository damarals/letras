"1" "It is Finished
Jimmy Needham

It is finished, It is finished
Tetelesti
The beauty of the double meaning phrase
He ceased from His labor and so have I
Now resting only in His grace

It is finished, it is finished
Tetelesti
The Son of Man succeeding where I failed
The wrath of God now satisfied
In Jesus, my Emmanuel

It is done, He's alive
And He is able to bring us life
In three days, He will rise
Tetelesti

It is finished, it is finished
Tetelesti
My hope found in the Savior's words alone
He willingly laid down His life
And gloriously He rolled away the stone

It is finished it is finished
Tetelesti
No longer need I labor for His love
For Christ fulfilling the law of God
Was deemed by God to be enough

It is finished, It is finished
Tetelesti
The wedding bells of freedom now ring
Your sons and daughters will testify
Now to you, Jesus, we will sing
We will sing

On Christ the solid rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand"
