"1" "Back In Baby's Arms
Amy Grant

I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Don't know why we quarrel
We never did before
Since we found out how it hurts
I'll bet we never quarrel anymore
I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms"
