Lauren Daigle

Here's my heart, Lord [x3]
Speak what is true [x2]

I am found, I am Yours
I am loved, I'm made pure
I have life, I can breathe
I am healed, I am free

Here's my heart, Lord [x3]
Speak what is true

Cause I am found, I am Yours
I am loved, I'm made pure
I have life, I can breathe
I am healed, I am free

You are strong, You are sure
You are life, You endure
You are good, always true
You are light breaking through

Oh, here's my heart, Lord
Here's my heart, Lord [x2]
Speak what is true

Here's my life, Lord [x3]
Speak what is true [x3]

I am found, I am Yours
I am loved, I'm made pure
I have life, I can breathe
I am healed, I am free

Cause You are strong, You are sure
You are life, You endure
You are good, always true
You are light breaking through

You are more than enough
You are here, You are love
You are hope, You are grace
You're all I have, You're everything

Here's my heart, Lord [x3]
Speak what is true

Here's my life, Lord [x3]
Speak what is true"
