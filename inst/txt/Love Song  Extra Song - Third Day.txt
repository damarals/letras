"1" "Love Song - Extra Song
Third Day

Take my heart and help me feel
Take my faith and make it real
Take my eyes and help me see
All the love surrounding me

*CHORUS*
Don't let me go
Hold me close to where you are
Don't let me go
Take my heart, Take all of me

Take my loss and take my gain
Take my trials and take my pain
Take my life and let it be
All that you would have for me

*CHORUS*

*Guitar solo*

*CHORUS*
Don't let me go
Take my heart, Take all of me
