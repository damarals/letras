"1" "Pour Out My Heart
Vineyard

Here I am
Once again
I pour out my heart
For I know that you hear
Every cry
You are listening
No matter what state
My heart is in

You are faithful to answer
With words that are true
And a hope that is real
As I feel your touch
You bring a freedon
To all that's within
In the safety of this place
I'm longing to

Pout out my heart
To say that I love You
Pout out my heart
To say that I need You
Pout out my heart
To say that i'm thankful
Pout out my heart
To say that You're wonderful"
