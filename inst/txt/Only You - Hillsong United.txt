Verse
On the mountain
In the valley
Everywhere I go
You are with me
Right beside me
You never let me go
The messiah
The almighty
Saviour of my soul
Saviour of my soul

In the daylight
In the shadow
Your faithfulness untold
You surround me
And protect me
Guiding as I go
The messiah
The almighty
Saviour of my soul
Saviour of my soul

Pre-chorus
There is nowhere I can run
There is nowhere I can hide
And if I ever lose my way
You're calling out my name
You're calling out my name

Chorus
Jesus
And only you can save us Jesus
Only you can heal us Jesus
Only you can fix this Jesus
Only you Jesus

Bridge
Now the boroughs have been opened
And the broken have been chosen
And the city is becoming alive in you"
