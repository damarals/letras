"1" "The Upside
Newsboys

It's been a long, long fall
With nothing to intervene
When gravity does its thing
We start wondering what it's for
Stuck in a cold, dark basement
You surely expected more
But all you can see these days is four walls and a floor...

Come up here
We're making our way to the upside
We're gonna stay on the upside
We'll trade our troubles for a room with a view
Come up here
We're making our way to the upside
A brand new day on the upside
The future's brighter than a sky full o' blue

It's been a long, long fall
The Adam who would be King
When consequence does its thing
We all want it like before
Nowhere to go, laid low
Like a dumpster diver, like a submarine wreck
Scraping the bottom deck
Won't you, don't you pray there's something more?

What's gonna hold us down?
Who's gonna hold us down?
How's it gonna hold us down?
Nothing's gonna hold us...

Come up
Weâ€™ll make our way to the upside
Weâ€™re here to stay on the upside
The futureâ€™s shining like a sky full oâ€™ blue
Come up here
Weâ€™re making our way to the upside
Weâ€™re gonna stay on the upside
Weâ€™ll trade our troubles for a room with a view
Come up here
Weâ€™re making our way to the upside
A brand new day on the upside
The futureâ€™s brighter than a sky full oâ€™blue
Come up here
Weâ€™re making our way to the upside
Weâ€™re gonna stay on the upside
The futureâ€™s brighter than a sky full oâ€™blue"
