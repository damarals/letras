"1" "Adding to the Noise
Switchfoot

What's it gonna take?
To slow us down?
To let the silence spin us around
What's it gonna take?
To drop this town
We¹ve been spinnin at the speed of sound

Steppin out of those convenience stores
What could we want, but more, more, more
From the Thirld World, to the corporate core
We are the symphony of modern humanity
Yeah

If we're adding to the noise
Turn off this song
If we're adding to the noise
Turn of your stereo, radio, video

I don't know
What they¹re gonna think up of next
Genetic engineers are the most high tech
A couple new ways, to fall into debt,
I'm a nervous wreck, but I'll bet that that Tv set

Tells us what we wanted to hear
But none of these soundbites are comin in clear
From the Third World, to the corporate ear
We are the symphony of modern humanity
Yeah

If we're adding to the noise
Turn off this song
If we're adding to the noise
Turn of your stereo, radio

If we're adding to the noise
Turn of this song
If we're adding to the noise
Turn of your stereo, radio (stereo radio, stereo radio, stereos etc.)

If we're adding to the noise
Turn of this song
If we're adding to the noise
Turn of your stereo, radio
If we're adding to the noise
If we're adding to the noise
If we're adding to the noise
Turn off this song"
