"x"
"1" "Forever Yours
Michael W. Smith

I'm swept away in this moment
I feel your heartbeat next to mine
My hands are trembling
It's overwhelming
A whisper breaks through the silence
A vow to test the breadth of time
\"Until forever, I'll be forever yours\"
Not just tonight
I'm by your side
For all yoour life

'Till death comes between us
And the heavens steal you away
I'll stay forever yours
Don't worry, Don't be afraid

The heart can shift like a shadow
The deepest passions start to wane
Stay ever tender
Never surrender
Come waltz whit me through the twilight
And we will dance as season pass
We move together
So hold me tight
Say you'll be mine
For all your life

'Till death comes between us
And the heavens steal you away
I'll stay forever yours
Don't worry, Don't be afraid

Come waht may
So all we have is this moment
But moments come and go so fast
Until forever
I'll be forever yours
There is no other
I am forever yours"
