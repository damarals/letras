"1" "We're Gonna Be Alright
Switchfoot

It's ok to fear
It's ok when you feel small
You're ok right here
It's ok when you feel nothing at all
It's ok to find out
What you though you had ain't what you got
It's ok to doubt

To learn what you think ain't what you thought
We are always in motion
Like the winds, the tides, the ocean
Everyday I'm born again
I wake up I feel that second wind
We're gonna be alright
I've seen the look in your eye
We're gonna be alright
Just take a look at the sky
We're gonna be alright

It's ok to grieve
It's ok to learn to fall
It's ok to believe
To admit that you're human after all
It's ok to heal
All of those scars buried deep inside
It's ok to feel
To say all the things you've been trying to hide
Lift it up to the ceiling
Cause we all need that healing
Let's get lost in the feeling, the feeling
The feeling
We're gonna be alright"
