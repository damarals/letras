"1" "Break The Cycle (Feat. Matty Mullins)
For Today

It's the blind
Leading the blind
Leading the blind to their demise

It's the blind
Leading the blind
Leading the blind to their demise

Break the cycle!
Break the cycle!
Break the cycle!

Self destruction has tainted our way of life
It's time to break the cycle
In the darkness of fear, there's a dawning light
It's time to break the cycle

We stumble around and fall to the ground
But are we too proud to reach out
To reach for a hand
That can help us to stand
And keep us from falling facedown?

We're only helpless
Because we're heartless

In a world
Headed for self-destruction
The answer is here
Are we too blind to see it?
In a world headed for self-destruction
The answer is here
Are we too blind to see it?

There is hope in the blood!
(So) rise up, there's a new day dawning!
We'll see the darkness flee
Rise up, there's a new day dawning, in which the blind will see!
I see a light in the darkness
rising in the night!
I see a light in the darkness
In the sons of light!

Bring this broken system to it's knees!
Bring this broken system to it's knees!
Break the cycle! Break the cycle!
We're only helpless
Because we're heartless

In a world headed for self-destruction
The answer is here
Are we too blind to see it?
In a world headed for self-destruction
The answer is here
Are we too blind to see it?

There is hope in the blood!
(So) rise up, there's a new day dawning!
We'll see the darkness flee
Rise up, there's a new day dawning
In which the blind will see!
I see a light in the darkness
Rising in the night!
I see a light in the darkness, in the sons of light!

It's the blind
Leading the blind
Leading the blind to their demise

It's the blind
Leading the blind
Leading the blind to their demise

Break the cycle!
Break the cycle!
Break the cycle!"
