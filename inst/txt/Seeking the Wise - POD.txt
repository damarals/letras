"1" "Seeking the Wise
P.O.D.

The world keeps on turning
And you're locked up in it 4x
Before I was lost, but now I am found 4x
Seeking the Wise 4x

I'm in like that and I'm right on time
I'm looking for the King and will find the way
The truth and the one that gives life Payable on Death

And we're seeking the wise, no where to run looking
for the Son

No where to run
2x

You are, you are the one
4x

I'm breathing dust of conspiracies, iniquities
Infiltrate the wisdom, but we bounce back and burn
like the sun
I'm needing help like welfare recipients
while false prophets keep writing fake manuscripts
Brought down like fugitives, saints on the warpath

Watch how you live, oh God, please make me capable,
Cause all human wisdom is fallible"
