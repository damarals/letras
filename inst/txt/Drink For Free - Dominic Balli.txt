"x"
"1" "Drink For Free
Dominic Balli

Can you tell me wise man, what my life’s about
Cuz I read somewhere, that he made me for his pleasure
That I sing by his hand, just cuz’ he loves the sound
But can you tell me wise man, what my life’s about (he said)

Why do you spend your money, on what is not bread
And your wages on what does not satisfy?

Can you tell me doctor, why I’m so lonely at night
Cuz I read somewhere, it’s cuz I’m livin’ with no hope now
Is this it doctor, I live then I die
Drink every passing pleasure, but never satisfied

Why do you spend your money, on what is not bread
And your wages on what does not satisfy?

Come come unto the waters and drink / Come come unto the waters waters / Come come unto the waters and drink yourself to life"
