"1" "Nobody Like Jesus
The Edwin Hawkins Singers

Verse 1:
You can search high and low,
it doesn’t matter where you go,
You won’t ever find,
find nobody like the Lord.

Chorus:
Nobody like Jesus,
you won’t ever find.
Nobody like Jesus,
you won’t ever, ever, ever find.

He’s the same yesterday and forever,
there is nobody like Jesus,
you won’t ever, ever, ever find.

Verse 2:
I’ve had many friends before,
they said they’d never let me down.
But they had problems of their own,
that’s why I turned to Jesus;
No, no, nobody like the Lord.

Chorus

Vamp:
Who can save you, Jesus.
Who can raise you, Jesus.
Who can fill you, Jesus,
No, no, nobody like the Lord.

Chorus"
