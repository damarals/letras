(It's been confirmed that the aliens have landed.)

Worldwide Jesus Domination
Love conquers all
Rise like a chosen generation
There's no stopping it all

Come on freaks let's go
Come on freaks let's go
Get all the freaks and lets go
Yeah yeah

Chorus:
We're taking over the world
We're the Alien Youth
We're coming for your souls
We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna
Shake the world
We're the Alien Youth
We're taking over, over, over
Alien Youth
Do you believe that the aliens have landed
We're everywhere you go
Infiltrate at the break of revolution
You can't stop the revival
And we're not going to leave this world alone
And we're not going to leave it yeah!

CHORUS

Come on freaks let's go
Get all the freaks and let's go
Come on freaks let's go
Get all teh freaks and let's go

And we're not going to leave this world along
And we're not going to leave it yeah!
And we're not going to leave this world alone
And we're not going to leave

CHORUS
