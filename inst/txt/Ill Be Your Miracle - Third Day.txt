"1" "I'll Be Your Miracle
Third Day

When you’re down and you’re falling fast
And you feel like your hope won’t last
You know that I’ll be your miracle
When you find that your faith is gone
You’re not sure if you can carry on
You know that I’ll be your miracle

You’ve been through more than anyone should
Can you find the good in such a bad situation
You never though this could happen to you
Now you know the truth
You feel like your life is fading

I hope you can remember

The life you had is going to change
But please don’t be afraid
It might be for the better

I’ll be the one that’s standing next to you
I’ll be the one that’s gonna help you make it through
When everybody else has gone
I’ll be the one that’s holding you"
