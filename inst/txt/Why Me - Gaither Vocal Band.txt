"1" "Why Me
Gaither Vocal Band

Why me Lord?
Whatever I have ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I´ve known
Tell me Lord
What did I ever do
that was worthy loving you
Or the kindness you´ve shown

Lord help me Jesus
I´ve wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know
That I´ve needed you so
Help me Jesus my soul is in your hands

Try me Lord
If you think there is a way
I could ever repay
All I´ve taken from you
Maybe Lord
I could show someone else
What I have been through myself
On my way back to you

Repete Coro...

Now that I know
That I´ve needed you so
Help me Jesus my soul is in your hands"
