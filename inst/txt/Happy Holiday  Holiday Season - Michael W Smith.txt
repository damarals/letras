"1" "Happy Holiday / Holiday Season
Michael W. Smith

Happy holiday
Happy holiday
While the merry bells keep ringing
Happy holidays to you

It's the holiday season
And Santa Claus is coming around
The Christmas snow is white on the ground
When old Santa gets into town
He'll be coming down the chimney, down
He'll be coming down the chimney, down

It's the holiday season
And Santa Claus has got a toy
For every good girl and good little boy
Santa's a great big bundle of joy
When he's coming down the chimney, down
When he's coming down the chimney, down

He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and for me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree

It's the holiday season
So whoop-de-do and hickory dock
And don't forget to hang up your sock
'Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock
He'll be coming down the chimney down
He'll be coming down the chimney down

He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and for me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree

It's the holiday season
So whoop-de-do and hickory dock
And don't forget to hang up your sock
'Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock
He'll be coming down the chimney down
coming down the chimney
coming down the chimney
coming down the chimney down

Happy Holiday
Happy Holiday
While the merry bells keep bringing
Happy Holidays to you"
