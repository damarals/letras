"1" "Louder Than The Radio
Delirious

I've been standing on the summit
I've been looking for the rain
I've been looking for the cloud to come
But maybe not the pain
I've been looking for a miracle
I've been looking for a sign
To see some hope come to the world

I've been standing with a blazing torch
I'vebeen looking where to run
I've been praying for the faith I need
To see your Kingdom come
I've been looking in the mirror
I think you need to change
Let's pray that hope comes to the world

Everybody 'round the world come on
We need some love to fall on us
Everybody 'round the world come on
We need some grace to fall on us.

I've been standing with the fatherless
We've been learning how to pray
All we're asking is the gracewe need to live a better way.
We've been longing for the walls to crash
That hold us from the truth.
Let's pray that hope comes to the world

Can you hear the sound that's rising?
From all corners of the earth
And young and old will stand together
Can you hear the praise?
It's louder than the radio.
