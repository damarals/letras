Fireflight

God protect me from myself
I search for life finding death
God heal me
My broken heart it longs for You

(Chorus)
I'm waiting, I'm waiting,
To hear You call my name
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
For You Lord

And I'm ready, for you to draw me near
It's always been this way with you
But that's what makes you dear

(Chorus)
I'm waiting, I'm waiting,
To hear You call my name
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
For You Lord

(Bridge)
Oh Lord You know my heart

(Chorus)
I'm waiting, I'm waiting,
To hear You call my name
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
For You Lord

I'm waiting, I'm waiting,
To hear You call my name
Fixated, I'm waiting
For You Lord"
