"1" "Only You
Jimmy Needham

Only you
No one else could ever take your place
Only you
Earth and heaven can pass away
I can't say enough about you
I can't see my world without you
Only you

Did you know you're a phenomenon?
Get me talking about it and I go on and on
No one like you in the world for me
Loving you, girl is simple math
To be whole I had to find me a better half
Now it's you forever and I hope you'll see

Only you
No one else could ever take your place
Only you
Earth and heaven can pass away
I can't say enough about you
I can't see my world without you
Only you

Who gives wanting nothing back?
Who can make up the difference
Everywhere I lack?
Who helped this foolish man find his way?
Who's kisses are forever mine?
Slow me down and speed me up
At the same time
It's you baby, you baby, everyday

Ain't never gonna be another girl like
No never gonna be
Never gonna be a girl like
Ain't never gonna be another girl like"
