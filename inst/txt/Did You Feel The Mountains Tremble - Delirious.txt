"1" "Did You Feel The Mountains Tremble?
Delirious

Did you feel the mountains tremble?
Did you hear the oceans roar?
When the people rose to sing of Jesus Christ the risen one.

Did you feel the people tremble?
Did you hear the singers roar?
When the lost began to sing of Jesus Christ the saving one.

And we can see that God you're moving
A mighty river through the nations
And young and old will turn to Jesus
Flying wide you heavenly gates
Prepare the way of the risen Lord

Open up the doors and let the music play
Let the streets resound with singing
Songs that bring your hope
Songs that bring your joy
Dancers who dance upon injustice.

Do you feel the darkness tremble?
When all the saints join in one song.
And all the streams flow as one river
To wash away our brokenness.

And here we see that God you're moving.
A time of jubilee is coming
When young and old return to Jesus
Flying wide you heavenly gates.
Prepare the way of the risen Lord."
