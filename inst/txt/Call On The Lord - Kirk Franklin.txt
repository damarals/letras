Call On The Lord Kirk Franklin lyrics
Artist: Kirk Franklin
Album: Kirk Franklin & The Family

When you're weary and discouraged and
You're feeling down and low
When your friends forsake you and
You have no place to go
When the burdens seem so hard for
You to try and bear

CHORUS
Just call on the Lord and He will be right there
Just call on the Lord and He will be right there

There have been times
I've felt so all alone
Feeling like all hope was gone
I'd lay awake in my bed at night
Wondering if everything would turn out right
Then the Master of the sea
Came down from Heaven and He rescued me

CHORUS

Call on Him, call on the Lord"
