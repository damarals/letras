"1" "Right Here
Vineyard

You're right here, You're so near
And You said You'll never go away
You're right here, You're so near
And You said You'll never leave

So real, so wonderful

Is the feeling of Your touch So near, so full of love
Is the embrace from God above
So clear, so good and just
Are the words You speak to comfort us
You pour out Your Spirit, give us new life
We are free and not lost

So gentle, so powerful
Is your presence on the earth
So kind so merciful
By Your grace You have chosen us"
