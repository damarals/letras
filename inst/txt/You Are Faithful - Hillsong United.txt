Hillsong United

Lord of all the earth
How You care for me
You have made me
You will save and carry me always

You are faithful
You are faithful
You are faithful
Your joy is my strength

Lord you are my God
I rely on You
I put my hope in things not seen
Your promises all true

Always you’re with me
Your hand will lift me
My trust is in your hands"
