don't go thinking i'm crazy
but my fear is it's too late
won't go making no trouble
'cause i feel like i could break

all of those times i ran away
from all of those things i used to say
all of those plans i had
to give it all

and i feel like i could break
and i feel like i could break
now it's more than i can take
and i feel like i could break

don't go thinking i'm crazy
but i'm feeling your heartache
your creation through your eyes
there is pain it's no mistake

closer i get to you i see
souls full of hurt, full of need
the closer i get i see less of me

and i feel like i could break
and, i feel like i could break
lord, i know now it's getting late
let my heart be broken by your heartache
and i feel like i could break
now, it's more than i can take

'cause all of those times i ran away
from all of those things I used to say
and all of those pains i feel
revealed to me

don't go thinking i'm crazy
but i feel like â€¦
