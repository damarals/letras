"1" "He Is Alive
Third Day

Angels are watching over us
With the saints that have gone on before us
And they join in a heavenly chorus
Singing \"he is alive, he is alive\"

He is alive
Death is defeated
Sin has retreated
From the power of the son
And he is alive
The enemy is faded
The battle still rages
But the war has been won

The stars in the heavens rejoice
With the sun and the moon
And with all of the earth
Let all of creation now lift up their voice
Singing \"he is alive, he is alive\"

Jesus is alive
Jesus is alive

He is alive
Death is defeated
Sin has retreated
From the power of the son

He is alive, he is alive
He is alive, he is alive

Jesus is alive
Jesus is alive"
