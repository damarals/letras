"1" "I Love You Lord
Vineyard

Whom have I in heaven but You Lord
Whom have I in heaven but You
And earth has nothing, I desire

Besides You

My flesh and my heart will fail
My flesh and my heart will fail

But You oh Lord are the strength I know
You oh Lord are the strength I know

Oh how I love You

Lord, all my days
Bringing You gifts of praise
Bowing before Your name
Right now
Oh how I love You Lord (Right now)"
