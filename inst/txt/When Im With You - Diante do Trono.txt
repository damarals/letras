"1" "When I'm With You
Diante do Trono

I was made for loving you
I was made to worship
I was made to give you praise
All of my days o lord
My all is for you
My all is for you

'cause when i'm with you
My heart is satisfied
And when i'm with you
My spirit can fly
When i'm with you
All the cares of my life
Fade away
'til all i want until all i see
Is you

'til all i want is you
'til all i see is you"
