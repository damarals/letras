Chris Tomlin

(Male) We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
(Female) Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty
(Male) We know living in Your freedom
(Female) Living in Your freedom we see Your glory

You are the fire through the night
You are the flame that burns inside
We need Your presence more than anything

You're more than just a song to sing
You're more than words and offerings
We need Your presence more than anything

You're all that we want
You're all that we need
(2x)

(Male) We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
(Female) Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty
(Male) We know living in Your freedom
(Female) Living in Your freedom we see Your glory

(Male) We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
(Female) Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty
(Male) We're Yours and Yours is the Kingdom!
(Female) We are Yours (Both) and Yours is the Kingdom!
(Both) Yours is the Kingdom!

Call us closer to Your heart
Lead us Lord to where You are
We need Your presence more than anything

You're all that we want
You're all that we need
(2x)

We know..."
