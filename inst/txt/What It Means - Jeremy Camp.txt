"1" "What It Means
Jeremy Camp

I've been here a thousand times before
Face down on the floor
Wondering how I even
Reached this place again

But You have shown so endlessly
How Your love pours over me
No picture can re-create
The beauty that I see

Show me what it means
To live my life
A sacrifice
If only I would realize
How much it took to pay the price
I know I'd always give
Everything to You

I want this world to always see
Your perfect majesty
Reflecting from my life
This brilliant poetry

Written all over this place
The signs of all creation that You breathes
Words can't eves how much
You mean to me

Show me what it means
To live my life
A sacrifice
If only I would realize
How much it took to pay the price
I know I'd always give
Everything to You
