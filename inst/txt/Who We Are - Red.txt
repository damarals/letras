"1" "Who We Are
Red

We were the ones who weren't afraid
We were the broken-hearted
We were the scars that wouldn't fade away
How did we let go?
How did we forget, that we don't have to hide

We won't believe the lies again
We won't be paralyzed!

We can be who we are, now we are alive!
We can fight, they cannot contain us
It's who we are, we are undying!
We won't hide our faces from the light
Eliminated the space between us
It's who we are, we are forever!
It's who we are!

We were the tears that passion cried
We were the sacrificed
We were the flame that wouldn't die, inside
How did we go wrong?
We will not forget, we won't get left behind
We won't give up the fight again
We won't be denied!

We can be who we are, now we are alive!
We can fight, they cannot contain us
It's who we are
We are undying, we are forever!
We won't hide our faces from the light
Eliminated the space between us
It's who we are, we are forever!
It's who we are!

We will never die!
We will never die!
We will lose this life knowing we are alive!

We can be who we are, now we are alive!
We can fight, they cannot contain us
It's who we are
We are undying, we are forever!
We won't hide our faces from the light
Eliminated the space between us
It's who we are, we are forever!
It's who we are!"
