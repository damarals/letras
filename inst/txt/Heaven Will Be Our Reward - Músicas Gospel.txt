"1" "Heaven Will Be Our Reward
MÃºsicas Gospel

It you make a bad decision,
It will land you in prison.
You can't kill, cheat or lie,
When none of it's justified.

The Bible tells us what's a sin,
All the actions we can't defend.
The Lord had it all laid out,
There's no room for any doubt.

Chorus:
If we obey the golden rules,
We'll hear the angels sing.
We won't be a Devils fool,
Who has gave up everything.
Heaven will be our reward,
We will walk with the Lord.

In life there's no short cuts,
Everyday will have deep ruts.
But when we believe in him,
A cups is filled to the brim.

Many things we'd like to see,
May never come to be.
But ahead are better days,
When heaven comes our way.

Chorus:
If we obey the golden rules,
We'll hear the angels sing.
We won't be a Devils fool,
Who has gave up everything.
Heaven will be our reward,
We will walk with the Lord."
