"1" "When He Speaks To Me
MÃºsicas Gospel

My life has been a hard one,
I have cried so many times.
But when I hear a small voice,
It straightens out my mind.

The voice says, \"don't despair,\"
Don't you ever give up on life.
Just have faith along the way,
And things will turn out right.

Chorus:
God's why I strive to survive,
And will as long as I'm alive.
No problems pulls me down,
When he speaks to me inside.

At times I'm having doubts,
Or it seems my hope is gone.
A little voice speaks to me,
And I have faith to go on.

At a time I might lose a friend,
I will pray for their soul.
I know the Lord's listening,
He shows them where to go.

Chorus:
God's why I strive to survive,
And will as long as I'm alive.
No problems pulls me down,
When he speaks to me inside."
