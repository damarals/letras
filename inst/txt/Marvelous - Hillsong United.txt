Marvelous your works, oh lord
Your ways are just and true
Sovereign king of nations
All will come and worship you in adoration
Worthy, your worthy
All heaven shouts hallelujah
Jesus, exalted high
Our God almighty reigns

Worthy, your worthy
All heaven shouts the name of Jesus
Glory and honour
Our God almighty reigns
Healer of the world
You took our sin upon yourself
Your own blood has freed us
Precious lamb of God

Was slain and has redeemed us
You are high and lifted up
You are high and lifted up
You are high and lifted up
In all the earth"
