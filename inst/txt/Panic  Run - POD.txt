"x"
"1" "Panic & Run
P.O.D.

What a wicked generation
With a modern day system babylon
Corruption and violence
Court is in session
So close your mind,look away and carry on
So close your mind, look away and carry on
Close your mind, look away and carry on

The sky is falling haven't you heard?
Eyes wide,shut tight no one says a word
This is a state of emergency
So don't hang around, don't be caught, panic and run

Propaganda,media persuasion
Controlling your senses,mind control
So break through these twisted vibrations
The world is ending,remember I told you so
I said the world is ending,remember I told you so
The world is end, remember

The sky is falling haven't you heard?
Eyes wide,shut tight no one says a word
This is a state of emergency
So don't hang around, don't be caught, panic and run

We're watching you die, we watch...

What a wicked generation

The sky is falling haven't you heard?
Eyes wide,shut tight no one says a word
This is a state of emergency
So don't hang around, don't be caught, panic and run"
