Vineyard

You are so good to me
Your endless mercies capture me
I revel in this saving blood
You paid it all to show me love

I'm undone
I'm undone by You
I'm undone

You are my refuge
My help in time of need
You wrap Your arms around me
Encompass me in Your wings

You paid the sacrifice of love
To hold me in Your arms
You reached Your hand out for my own
And You pulled me from the dark
You pulled me from the dark"
