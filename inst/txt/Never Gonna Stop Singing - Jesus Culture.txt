"1" "Never Gonna Stop Singing
Jesus Culture

You called us into darkness
You reached out to save us
You conquored the grave
You crossed the divide; lost in our sin
You made us alive
How can we ever hold it inside?
We can't hold back

Chorus
We're gonna lift You higher, higher
Hearts burning bright like a fire, fire
Voices unite make it louder, louder
We're never gonna stop the singing!
We're never gonna stop the singing!

Set free no longer bound in chains
You rescued me and called me by name
You conquored the grave
You crossed the divide; lost in our sin
You made us alive
How can we ever hold it inside?
We can't hold back

Bridge
Every tribe, every tongue
Every heart will sing
Every knee we will
Bown to the Risen King
Lift Him up, lift Him up
We're never gonna stop the singing
Ooh we're never gonna stop"
