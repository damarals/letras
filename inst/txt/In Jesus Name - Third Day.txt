"1" "In Jesus' Name
Third Day

The blind have sight
The deaf now hear
The lame will walk
The lost drawn near
And with new life
The dead are raised
All through the power
In Jesus name

The tired find rest
The sick are healed
The mysteries of our God revealed
And now the truth
Can be proclaimed
All through the power
In Jesus name

Name above all names
Savior and our Lord
Every knee will bow
And every tongue confess
No other name is given
By which we can be saved
Let us find our life and love
In Jesus name

The thirsty filled
The hungry fed
And those who mourn
Are comforted
The chains are broken
That have enslaved
We're offered freedom
In Jesus name

There is power
There is hope
There is love like you've never known
There is forgiveness
And healing from your pain
All through the power
In Jesus name

Let us find our life and love
In Jesus name"
