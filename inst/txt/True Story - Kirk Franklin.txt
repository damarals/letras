Kirk Franklin

(True story)
She's a small town woman
In a big time world
She's a mother and a father
To one boy three girls
She got her grandma's bible
Next to the bills and her purse
With no more options
She drops her knees in the dirt
(She says)

Lord, please help me
I'm lost, don't leave
I've tried and tried but this one thing

Now the only thing I wanna do
Is everything that tore my heart in two
I give it all to you
All I want is you
It's funny everything you thought you knew
Changes when you think your life is through
And your days are few
Now what do you do?
Everything has changed
Now I know that grace is amazing

(True story)
It's been since last august
No job in sight
He's now across the water
Another war to fight
He's made a lot of mistakes but
He wanna make things right
When he comes back home from battle
Another boy got shot last night
(He said)

Lord, please help me
I'm lost, don't leave
I've tried and tried but this one thing

Now the only thing I wanna do
Is everything that tore my heart in two
I give it all to you
All I want is you
It's funny everything you thought you knew
Changes when you think your life is through
And your days are few
Now what do you do?
(True story)
Everything has changed
Now I know that grace is amazing

(She said)
We put a lot of miles on this heart
The only thing I wanted from the start is to please you
To chase you
(And he said)
We put a lot of miles on this heart
The only thing I wanted from the start is to please you
We're running after you

(Every day we say)
Lord, please help me
I'm lost, don't leave
I've tried and tried but this one thing
(This is my story)

Now the only thing I wanna do
Is everything that tore my heart in two
I give it all to you
All I want is you
It's funny everything you thought you knew
Changes when you think your life is through
And your days are few
Now what do you do?

Now the only thing I wanna do
Is everything that tore my heart in two
I give it all to you
All I want is you
It's funny everything you thought you knew
Changes when you think your life is through
And your days are few
Now what do you do?

(Let's ride)

See it's a true story to me
How grace is amazing
It's amazing
See I don't know where I would be
Without grace amazing
It's amazing
