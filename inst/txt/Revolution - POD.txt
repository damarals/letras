"1" "Revolution
P.O.D.

More calm than a heartbeat that flat lines
Quiet like a dog street under the moonlight
A Razorback shun that's been screened by the
Gethsemane
Ever since they're first experienced
Injustice, prejudice, discrimination
A world out of in a gun shot
It's off the man, a babies lap, it will pass
Just like it always has. Until it spits of the lips
The next man who's had it up to here.

Did somebody say a Revolution?
Or is it all in my head?
Is that what it takes to make a solution
Your Revolution

I'm not the first or the last to imagine it
Acknowledge the concepts, question and grasp it
Rebel against the eye and bring down the cell.
Mutiny, me overthrow you
Rebellion starts within, the time is now

Did somebody say a Revolution?
Or is it all in my head?
Is that what it takes to make a solution, solution

Did somebody say a Revolution?
Or is it all in my head?
Is that what it takes to make a solution
Your Revolution

Purple skies, Devil eyes, Hypnotize
Little lies, Compromise, Fireflies
Serum arise, Parasite, Fly by night, After light,
Materialize,
Look alive, Stereotype, Do with I, A lullaby's black
and white

Did somebody say a Revolution?
Or is it all in my head?
Is that what it takes to make a solution, solution

Did somebody say a Revolution?
Or at least it's been said
Is that what it takes to make a solution?
Your Revolution

No resolution -Your Revolution
And what's your solution? -Your Revolution
And no substitution -Your Revolution
And no resolution -Your Revolution
And what's your solution?"
