Of the Lord our Savior

We the tidings tell.

For Christ the King is born.

For Christ our Lord is born.

Angel from on high

May shepherds come and see.

He's born in Bethlehem

A blessed family.

Glory to God,

For Christ the King is born.

Glory to God,

For Christ our Lord is born.

Sing we now of Christmas

Emmanuel, Emmanuel.
