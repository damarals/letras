Hillsong United

The holiest place that could ever be
All you can do is bow
Before the One who made heaven and earth
Before the Almighty God
For Him alone

Sing with the angels
Sing with the angels
Singing the Name of the Lord
Singing the Name of the Lord

For every soul, He gave it all
Given for all of mankind
Eternal life is His alone
Given to all who believe
In Him alone, in Him alone

Jesus"
