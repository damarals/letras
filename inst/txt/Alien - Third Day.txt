Third Day

I'm what your looking for
No need to search any more
I'm in need of your saving
You can give me hope
Rescue my wretched soul
You are the one I am praying

I am just like the alien
the fatherless and the widow

Keep your watch over me
Sustain the life in me
Frustrate the ways of every wicked man
Let me inside your home
Father defend my cause
Plead for my case
And my innocence

Just like the alien,
I'm a stranger in a strange land
Just like the fatherless I am in need
of someone to take my hand
Just like the widow,
I need you right now to understand and
save me."
