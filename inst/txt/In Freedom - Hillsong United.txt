"1" "In Freedom
Hillsong United

A rising generation set apart for liberty
A royal loving people
Chosen to be mighty, mighty in the land
A people who are hungry
Hungry for the bread of life
A people who are thirsty
Thirsty for the river
The river of Joy
And all across this nation
A cry is ringing out
The church of the kingâ€™s breaking out

In freedom
In power, in healing
Salvation to the ends of the earth"
