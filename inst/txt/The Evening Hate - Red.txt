"1" "The Evening Hate
Red

The air feels heavier tonight
Something's coming
The lights are restless in the skysilence, cutting

I lie awake
Hopeless, insane

Inside my grave
I made while I

Wait for the pain
Inside the evening hate
Inside the evening hate

The fear is near, it starts to rise
Cadence, growing
The shadows spill across the line
Darkness is flowing

Voices screaming
Cold hands reaching

The earth shaking
My mind, breaking

Wait for the pain
Inside the evening hate
Inside the evening hate

It falls like rain
The evening hate
It falls like rain
The evening hate

Hate, wait for the pain
Hate, wait for the pain

Like cinders it rains
We fall, we fall
An empire in flames
We crawl, we're crawling out

Inside the evening hate
Inside the evening hate

Wait for the pain
Inside the evening hate
Inside the evening hate

Like cinders it rains
We fall, we fall
An empire in flames
We crawl, we crawl"
