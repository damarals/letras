"1" "My Heart Is Overwhelmed
Hillsong United

Verse 1:
Perfect in love
Lord, You came to earth
To rescue me
And took my place upon that cross
The stains that held me back
Were washed away
You made me whole

Chorus:
Your love has set
The broken captives free
Your love release
The chains once binding me
Now I'm found in Grace
In love's embrace
My heart is overwhelmed

Verse 2:
I stand redeemed
Your Spirit now alive within my heart
I walk with You all of my days
I shall live to glorify You God
Hear my soul rejoice

Bridge:
Sings my soul of how
Your love has set me free
Sings my heart of how
Your mercy rescued me
Hear my cry of endless love
To my Saviour and to my King
My Heart is overwhelmed"
