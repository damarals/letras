"1" "Walking Away With You
Amy Grant

He calls me to the darkness.
He tries to put some hardness
In my heart,
Pulling us apart.
He tells me that he needs me,
But lies are all he feeds
Into my life,
Day and night.

When I'm losing my sense of direction,
And I'm needing some strength and protection,
Walking away with You.
I go walking away with You, and when I,
When I think I can't stand any longer,
And I'm crying for someone that's stronger,
Walking away with You.
I go walking away with You.

There's nothing he can do,
His threat to me is through,
And I go walking away with You.

Lonely overtakes me,
Everyone forsakes me,
Friends are gone.
Pain is on.
Walls around my feelings,
Emptiness concealing
All my views,
All of You.

When I'm needing someone to console me,
Nearly dying for someone to hold me,
Walking away with You.
I go walking away with You, and when I'm,
When I'm faced with a tricky temptation,
I abandon the whole situation,
Walking away with You.
I go walking away with You.

Oh, what a fail safe plan,
Just staying hand in hand,
I'll keep on walking away with You.

I don't notice if no one's around me,
When I see that Your loving has found me,
Taken my surprise,
Like sunlight in a clouded sky....
When I'm dancing His light is a favor.
Au revoir to the stormy weather,
Walking from the night.
To a neverending light....

When I'm losing my sense of direction,
And I'm needing some strength and protection,
Walking away with You.
I go walking away with You, and when I,
When I think I can't stand any longer,
And I'm crying for someone that's stronger,
Walking away with You.
I go walking away with You.

When I'm needing someone to console me,
Nearly dying for someone to hold me,
Walking away with You.
I go walking away with You, and when I'm,
When I'm faced with a tricky temptation,
I abandon the whole situation,
Walking away with You.
I go walking away with You.

When I'm losing my sense of direction,
And I'm needing some strength and protection,
Walking away with You.
I go walking away with You, and when I,
When I think I can't stand any longer,
And I'm crying for someone that's stronger,
Walking away with You.
I go walking away with You.
