Newsboys

find yourself
ya' darkest enemy
given up on what you thought you'd be
plans were made
nothing's really changed
be planning on one thing
you're loved just the same

when it all comes 'round
everyone's someone
when it all comes 'round
everyone's someone

kinda look old
like a man with everything
give it all for something real
no you can't take it with you
nothing's forged, nothing's new
do i imagine being you
maker of the rain
lets it fall the same on me and you

no matter who you are
no matter where you run
no matter what you do
what you're going through
