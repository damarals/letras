"1" "We Are One
Dominic Balli

Love
Love
Love
Love

I woke up this morning brushed my teeth
Kissed my wife turned on the Tv
Radio or magazines
No matter where I turn the same old thing
Earthquakes and war zones
Broken hearts broken homes
Gang wars catastrophe
Starving kids and slavery

Love love love what if there was love

I mean, I love myself take care of mine
My treasure talent and precious time
But when it comes to humanity
I'm not so sure man honestly

I mean just today on the street
I saw a man I thought needed me
What's crazy and amazing
Is I'm not sure who needed who more
Imagine that

You could bring the melody I could bring the harmony
Marching to the beat just like a symphony

From mansions to ghettos black white or yellow
Kampala New York or rio
We are one
From slumdog to rich man La to London
No matter where you come from
We are one"
