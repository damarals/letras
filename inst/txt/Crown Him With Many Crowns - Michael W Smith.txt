"1" "Crown Him With Many Crowns
Michael W. Smith

Musical Adaptation: Michael W. Smith

Crown Him with many crowns,
The lamb upon the throne:
Hark! How the heav'nly anthem drowns
All Music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
Of Him who died for thee,
And hail him as thy matchless King
Thru all eternity.
Crown Him with many crowns
Crown Him with many crowns

Crown Him the Lord of Heav'n:
One with the Father known.
One with the Spirit thru Him giv'n
From yonder glorious throne.
To Thee be endless praise.
For Thou hast died for me;
Be Thou, O Lord, thru endless days
Adored and magnified

Adored and magnified
Crown Him with many crowns

His glories now we sing,
Who died and rose on high,
Who died eternal life to bring
And...lives that death may die.

Crown Him with many crowns
