"1" "God's Great Dance Floor
Chris Tomlin

I'm coming back to the start
Where you found me
I'm coming back to your heart
Now I surrender
Take me
This is all I can bring

I'm coming back to the start
I got this freedom
In here we feel your heart
Your heartbeat for us
Take me
This is all I can bring

You'll never stop loving us
No matter how far we run
You'll never give up on us
All of heaven shouts: let the future begin
Let the future begin

Take me
This is all I can bring

You'll never stop loving us
No matter how far we run
You'll never give up on us
All of heaven shouts: let the future begin

I feel alive, I come alive
I am alive on god's great dance floor
I feel alive, I come alive
I am alive on god's great dance floor"
