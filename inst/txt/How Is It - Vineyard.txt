Vineyard

These lips were born to praise You
These eyes were born to look upon Your face
This heart was born to love You
And Lord You know that's what I want to do

How is it that You Love me like You do
I'll give You all this heart has to give
Ocean waves crash upon my shore
And you are waiting at my door

These hands were born to be raised to You
These feet were born to dance in this place
This spirit was born to worship You
And Lord You know that's what I want to do"
