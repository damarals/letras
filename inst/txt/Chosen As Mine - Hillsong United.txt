"1" "Chosen As Mine
Hillsong United

Here I am so close to you
Know my voice, I’ll never leave you
For I have loved you since before the sands of time were made
I love you still and always will.
You’re chosen as Mine

My Father wants to bless you now,
Receive from Him all that you’ll ever need.
Come spend eternity with Me. My heart’s full of love for you.
I love you still and always will.
You’re chosen as Mine.

Cries in the desert, My child, I hear them.
Tears in the valley, My lovely, I count them.
You’re so precious; you were on My mind as I died.

I love you still, always will.
Chosen as Mine."
