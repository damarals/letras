"1" "Waiting On Today
P.O.D.

I'm wishin', searchin' for somethin'
and life is goin' on.
Time is tickin', and I'm sleepin'
I feel it comin' on, I feel it comin' on
We keep it comin' on, So keep livin' on, livin' on

Waiting On Today, Tell me it's ok
So I won't run away
Waiting On Today, Tell me that you'll stay
So I won't run away

I'm missin', days are back then
And life was goin' on, Alive and kickin'
Waitin' for meanin', and now were movin' on,
and now were movin' on, We keep it movin' on,
So keep livin' on, livin' on

Waiting On Today, Tell me it's ok
So I won't run away
Waiting On Today, Tell me that you'll stay
So I won't run away

Waiting On Today, Tell me it's ok
So I won't run away
Waiting On Today, Tell me that you'll stay
So I won't run away

I feel it comin' on
And we run
And now we're movin' on
And we run
I feel it comin' on
And we run
And now we're movin' on
And we run

I feel it comin' on
I gotta join it now!
And now we're movin' on
I gotta go right now!
I feel it comin' on
I gotta live it now!
So keep livin' on, livin' on

Waiting On Today, Tell me it's ok
So I won't run away
Waiting On Today, Tell me that you'll stay
So I won't run away

Waiting On Today, Tell me it's ok
So I won't run away
Waiting On Today, Tell me that you'll stay
So I won't run away
