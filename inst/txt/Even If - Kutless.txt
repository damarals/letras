Sometimes all we have to hold on to
Is what we know is true of who you are
So when the heartache hits like a hurricane
That could never change who you are
And we trust in who you are

Even if the healing doesn't come
And life falls apart
And dreams are still undone
You are god you are good
Forever faithful one
Even if the healing
Even if the healing doesn't come

Lord we know your ways are not our ways
So we set our faith in who you are
Even though you reign high above us
You tenderly love us
We know your heart
And we rest in who you are

You're still the great and mighty one
We trust you always
You're working all things for our good
We'll sing your praise

You are god and we will bless you
As the good and faithful one
You are god and we will bless you
Even if the healing doesn't come
Even if the healing doesn't come"
