"1" "His Coming Is Soon
Alessandra Samadello

The signs of his coming are around us everywhere
The talk is war, no peace, they say hate, don’t believe
Human life is a fragile item for display
Merchandise, no value, no worth, just pain
In the middle of destruction we stand and built the walls
The walls of compassion, the shadows of a perfect cross

His coming is soon, his coming is near
What are you doing to make it happen here?
His coming is soon, his coming is near
Be ready my friend and watch, be ready for the day is near

The signs of his coming are so present everywhere
The cry of children: “Please, give us love, give us peace”
You and I are to go and share who we are
Or should we wait to hear the stones in their cry?
In the middle of destruction we show we have the hope
The hope on his return, coming to take us home

His coming is soon, his coming is near
What are you doing to make it happen here?
His coming is soon, his coming is near
Be ready my friend and watch, be ready for the day is near

Come and share the gospel
Take it with you everywhere
God has chosen his messengers
We are the ones to proclaim

His coming is soon, his coming is near
What are you doing to make it happen here?
His coming is soon, his coming is near
Be ready my friend and watch
Be ready my friend and watch, be ready for the day is near."
