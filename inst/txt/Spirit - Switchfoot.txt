Spirit, fall fresh on me (2x)

Hear my cry, fill my life
I won't need anything but You

I found all that I want, all that I longed for in You (2x)
Wasted time, is when I'm far from Your truth
I've found all that I want, all that I long for in You

Spirit, come be my joy (2x)
Be my song, fill my lungs

I wont need anything but You

I found all that I want, all that I longed for in You (2x)
Wasted time, is when I'm far from Your truth
I've found all that I want, all that I long for in You

I've found all that I want, all that I long for in You (2x)
Wasted time is when I'm far from Your truth

I've found all that I want, all that I long for in You
All that I want, all that I long for in You
I've found all that I want, all that I long for in You (2x)
I've found all that I want, all that I long for is You
Yes, You're all that I want, all that I long for is You"
