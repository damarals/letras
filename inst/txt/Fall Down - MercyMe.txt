MercyMe

Your word, Oh Lord, is eternal it stands firm
Your faithfulness continues through all the earth
All creation hangs on Your every word

With the sound of Your voice
Waters still, You are Lord over all
With the touch of Your robe
Sick are healed
For You Jesus we all fall down

My soul finds rest and comfort from only You
My fortress and my rock I won't be moved
You are my cornerstone who's love endures

With the sound of Your voice
(waters still) Waters still. You are Lord over all
With the touch (with the touch) of Your robe (of Your robe)
Sick are healed and for You Jesus we all fall down

And I praise You for I am fearfully and wonderfully made
And I praise You for I am fearfully and wonderfully made

With the sound of Your voice
(Waters still) Waters still You are Lord over all
With the touch (with the touch) of Your robe (of Your robe)
Sick are healed and for Your Jesus we all fall down

We fall down
We fall down...."
