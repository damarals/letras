Let all the earth declare Your Name
Voices resounding heaven?s fame
Our God be praised forever

Flood all the earth with endless light
Raise up the streets from death to life
Our God be praised forever
Oh God be praised

CHORUS
Come let Your glory arise
And shine as the nations collide with Your story
Love overtaking our lives
Arise as our hearts come alight with Your glory

Let all injustice shut it?s mouth
As we join our hearts and start to shout
Our God be praised forever
Oh God be praised

Be unto Your Name
All glory and honour
Singing holy is our God
Holy is our God

Your life on display
Your strength in our weakness
Singing holy is our God
Holy is our God

How great is Your love
How great are Your ways
There?s nothing we want more
But to live for You God

There?s no other Name
More worthy of praise
Jesus let Your love be known

We?ll shine with Your glory
We?ll shine with Your glory
We?ll shine with Your glory
It?s all for Your glory"
