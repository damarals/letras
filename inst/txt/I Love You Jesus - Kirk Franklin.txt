"1" "I Love You, Jesus
Kirk Franklin

CHORUS

I love You, Jesus
I love You, Jesus
You are so worthy, worthy
Love You, love You
Jesus


You inhabit the praise of Your people
Who kneel down humble before You
To worship and adore You
You are so worthy, worthy
Love You, love You Jesus


Love You, love You
Jesus"
