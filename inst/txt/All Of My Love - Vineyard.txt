Vineyard

Praise to You the Son of God above
Praise to You the One who takes my sin
Oh Lord oh Lord You are worthy to be praised

I worship You with all my heart
I lay my life down at Your feet
I bring to You all of my love
I bring to You all of my love
All of my love
All of my love
All of my love

Love such love You died upon the Cross
Love such love You heal my brokeness
Oh Lord oh Lord You are worthy to be praised"
