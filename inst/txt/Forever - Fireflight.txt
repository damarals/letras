"1" "Forever
Fireflight

Sometimes I feel so cold
Like I'm waiting
Around all by myself
Loneliness gets so old
I'm in the lost and found
Sitting on the shelf
Been stuck for way too long
But I hear Your voice
You're who I'm counting on

Oh, tell me You're here
That You
Will watch over me forever
Oh, take hold of my heart
Show me
You'll love me forever

I know that You can tell
When I start
To let my hope fade away
I need to catch myself
Open my ears to hear
You calling my name
Been fighting way too long
But I hear Your voice
You had me all along

When I'm starting to drown
You jump in to save me
When my world's upside down
Your hands
They shake me and wake me"
